We finished the year strong with significant business momentum in the fourth quarter. Market share gains in core products fueled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 51% increase in operating income.
Revenue for the quarter was $171 million, and EPS of $1.91 was up 45% versus last year. High-grade market share reached a new high of 22.8%, and high-yield share surged to a new record of 17.1%, up from 10.6%.
Open Trading volume grew 63% to $218 billion in the fourth quarter, driving estimated transaction cost savings of $225 million to our clients.
We closed on the acquisition of Deutsche Börse's regulatory reporting hub during the quarter, and client onboarding and integration is underway.
On the back of the strong results, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, up from $0.60.
Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results show consistent execution of our growth agenda with strong 5-year and 10-year compound revenue growth of 18% and compound EPS growth of 25%. For full year 2020, revenue growth was 35% and EPS growth was 45%. The results this year reflect strength in all of our core credit products, with record volume and revenue in U.S. high-grade, high-yield, global EM, Eurobonds and munis.
Total credit trading volume was up 29% in 2020 to $2.6 trillion. Active trading client firms during 2020 surpassed 1,800, about half of which are outside of the U.S. Open Trading grew 33% of our traded volume, up from 26% in 2019. Estimated transaction cost savings from Open Trading skyrocketed to $1.1 billion for the full year. Investors and dealers both initiated record order flow into our Open Trading liquidity pool in 2020.
Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High-grade and high-yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years. This is one of the factors contributing to our increase in fee capture per million in high-grade. These market conditions are normally not favorable for volume growth. However, market share grew strongly during the second half of the year, driving superior revenue and earnings growth.
Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading saw sustained growth, even though market conditions normalized in the second half of the year, demonstrating the central role of our marketplace in today's credit market. Open Trading credit volume in the fourth quarter increased 63%, and overall credit trading revenue grew 34% versus last year.
For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 34% of our global credit trading volume, up from 27% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dealer-initiated Open Trading volume grew 70% year-over-year, and over 1,600 unique client firms completed at least 1 trade in Open Trading during the quarter. Open trading volumes show strong growth trends in each of our core products. We are creating new trading and portfolio opportunities for our clients by delivering over 28,000 Open Trading orders per day, totaling $15 billion in daily notional value.
During the year, we also delivered important protocol enhancements, including Live Markets, our order book for actively traded corporate bonds as well as Mid-X, our sessions-based matching platform that utilizes our composite plus mid-market data.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation, information services and post trade."

Automated trading volumes rose to $32 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Auto-X's trade count grew in the quarter to 163,000, up 28% from the prior year. We are also seeing a healthy adoption of Auto-X across eurobonds, high-yield and emerging market bonds. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In U.S. investment-grade, the average trade size in 2020 grew 14% compared to 2019 and 40% compared to 2018. Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.9 million algos -- algo responses in the fourth quarter, resulting in 308,000 trades. The average number of responses per inquiry remains strong, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform.
Our new automated liquidity provision solution, Auto-Responder, has seen early traction. The solution allows investors to automatically respond to request for liquidity through Open Trading. In 2020, over $10 billion in notional value was automatically made available through our Auto-Responder solution. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in credit, we are seeing continued demand for our automated trading solutions.
Slide 8 provides an update on product diversification. Market data and analytics have never been more in demand than today. Information Services revenue reached $34.3 million for the year, with a 5-year compounded growth rate of 11%. Our unique data solutions are assisting bond pricing and liquidity providers on our trading platform, thus helping to generate greater transaction volume.
In the years following the implementation of MiFID II, our post-trade services business has grown substantially. Post-trade revenues were $19.5 million in 2020, up 23% year-over-year. Reflecting our commitment to post trade, we recently announced the completed acquisition of Deutsche Börse's regulatory reporting hub, which adds significant client penetration in Continental Europe and strengthens our data capabilities.
Our Rates business hit a critical milestone in the fourth quarter by integrating U.S. Treasury trading capabilities within the MarketAxess platform, providing a centralized fixed income trading solution with a full Click-To-Trade suite of products. This allows current credit trading users to seamlessly access this unique rates trading solution with complete post-trade integration.
We also launched our net-hedging solution in Q4, which supports our credit trading clients' ability to efficiently hedge their corporate bond transactions.
Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 26% year-over-year to $318 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and an increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year-over-year to 22.8%, while estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 10% year-over-year.
Volumes in our other credit category were up 36% year-over-year to $321 billion for the quarter. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the 74% increase in U.S. high-yield volume.
Eurobond volumes experienced a 31% increase, and emerging market bond volume grew by 19% year-over-year. I am also excited to report that our municipal bond volume doubled year-over-year.
Our Rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2019 in what was a difficult market environment. We believe the investment made in new trading technology, expanded product coverage and enhanced data tools will continue to differentiate our rates offering.
Our 2020 green bond trading initiative was very successful, with $27 billion green bonds traded on the platform, resulting in nearly 135,000 trees planted in critical regions across the world. With 3 trading days remaining in January, estimated U.S. TRACE market volumes are running more than 10% above January 2020, while estimated Eurobond and emerging market volumes are similar to January 2020. Estimated combined market share across our 4 core products is seasonally below the fourth quarter levels, but well above the January 2020 levels. Our month-to-date average daily trading volume in credit products is up more than 20% versus January 2020. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."

On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $171 million, up 32% year-over-year. The 31% increase in credit trading volume and higher overall credit fee capture resulted in a 33% uplift in commissions.
Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year, and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%.
The effective tax rate was 19.2% in the fourth quarter, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 20%, which was right at the low end of our 2020 guidance range.
On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher U.S. high-grade fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. A combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. 
Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution of fees was due to variances in unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans.
Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in head count of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. Clearing costs were up almost 50%, reflecting the 63% increase in Open Trading volume. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we expect our steady-state third-party clearing costs for credit trading, measured as a percentage of Open Trading revenue or on a per-ticket basis, to decline by upwards of 1/3. Excluding M&A transaction and integration costs and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the regulatory hub acquisition, expenses were up 12% in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $489 million, and free cash flow reached a record $340 million in 2020. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $150 million and capital expenditures were $46 million in 2020. With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past 5 years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation.
Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants.
During the fourth quarter, we also entered into a new $500 million revolving credit facility with the syndicated banks to support our clearing activities and add financial flexibility. There were no borrowings outstanding at year-end under this facility.
On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2021 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses, consistent with the trend over the past several years. We have built the plan using a sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance. This guidance range reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition, including an estimated $5 million for amortization of acquired intangibles and $5 million in nonrecurring integration costs. Excluding the expenses related to regulatory reporting hub, the midpoint in the guidance range would represent an approximate 13% year-over-year increase in expenses on a constant currency basis.
2021 capital expenditures are expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, of which roughly 2/3 relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform. 
We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2021 will range from 22% to 24%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2020 is driven by lower estimated excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Based on the expected timing for realizing the excess tax benefits, the effective tax rate will likely be in the 20% range in the first quarter and then the 24% to 25% range in the second, third and fourth quarters.
Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that.

It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. I'd say we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGR. If you look at the expense CAGR over the past 5 or 10 years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history.
And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders would continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path.
Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really headcount-driven. If you think about the 80 or so people that we added in 2020, we have plans to add another 60 or so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021, so it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase.
The other piece, you look at -- and this will be along the investment theme, depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in trading protocols and the platform. And specifically, it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items.
And I'd give you 2 other items, just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now, in our models, we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers.
The other one, just to give you a little bit of color, we're expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just 2 minutes on that because there's 2 components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit and then you have clearing costs related to U.S. Treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat the savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the U.K. Those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in U.S. Treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady-state savings from the transition in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset. So I just want to give you a little bit of color on that. Well, that was a long-winded answer, wasn't it?"

And I'm just trying to understand why it doesn't seem like we saw any impact in this quarter, and I thought we ramped -- or started to launch it in August. And where are we at as we enter the new year in regards to fully have all the capital in place, et cetera?"

And we have the costs associated with clearing, Open Trading, corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the U.S., transition to the settlement agent in the U.K. And that's what we've been talking about a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of 1/3.
But the second component, and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction, the second component is clearing cost for U.S. Treasury trading, where MarketAxess intermediates those trades. In the near term, we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries runs somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term, but you have to look at those 2 pieces.
Now in the fourth quarter, and I -- admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing cost. So for example, as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit, clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running the prior year a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledged that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses. Third-party clearing cost expenses for credit we believe that the savings will be upwards of 1/3 on a steady-state basis, whether you look at it as a percentage of Open Trading revenue on a per-ticket basis on a per-million traded basis. We're still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with, again, with we have 2 elements to our clearing costs, both corporate bonds and then on the treasury side."

So for your more liquid front end of the curve would be Click-To-Trade solutions, and then you'd be able to RFQ across the curve for larger trade size or less liquid products. And that right now is being communicated to our clients, and the demand is quite high, particularly around the events of last year and the liquidity constraints that were on some of the other platforms offering rates trading. So there's some excitement from our clients on providing not only a full breadth of product with unique off-the-run Click-To-Trade solutions, but also having a unique liquidity on the platform similar to how we run our credit trading solutions."

But I'm glad you pointed out 2 enormous growth opportunities for us. And we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020, and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead.
And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there's a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know, the muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world, so Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value where we can connect all market participants into our all-to-all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade.
EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And  when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic. And global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM, but 26 local markets all in 1 marketplace, with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all-to-all or Open Trading. So we think we've got a tremendous opportunity there. We're excited about the signs we see at beginning of electronic trading adoption in important areas like Asia. We are seeing really good client takeup going on there, and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are, as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large, and munis and global are just 2 of many examples that we're looking at right now.
And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top 5 banks alone had global FIC revenue of $68 billion. MarketAxess had a record year of about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see as the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity. And that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business."

And again, the automated trading solution has been largely adopted by clients for small-ticket solution. It hasn't been targeted for larger ticket. However, as we think about developing the automated suite of products, our target is for block trades, particularly when you start to integrate both Auto-Responder, which is the ability to provide liquidity to other parties who are requesting price, and Auto-X, and putting together those products into a single suite or a single order similar to a client algorithm would allow larger block orders to provide liquidity throughout the day and then Auto-X at the end of the day. So both liquidity provider and the liquidity taker all-in-one automated solution. Those are some of the targets that we have in 2021 as part of the initiatives around automation. But today, as we see the current client experience, the execution quality for trades somewhere around $2 million in size is quite similar to anything $5 million in size. So that's why we're seeing a nice growth, a 14% growth year-over-year in trade sizes in automation."

Thanks for that, Kyle. And you're right. This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess, seeing the inflection point in high-yield during the course of 2020.
But I'd point to a number of things. It's the size of our open order trading -- Open Trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading, and the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution and the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving.
I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high-yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients is through the MarketAxess system. The hedge funds are getting much more involved in our high-yield platform and finding great trading opportunities. And then there's significant growth going on in systematic credit trading strategies. And we see a lot of activity in rebalancing from systematic strategies coming into the high-yield platform. So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go.
The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last 3 or 4 quarters is that a year ago the bulk of our activity in high-yield was really in $1 million and under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high-yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we're really pleased with the results, but we think there's a long way to go. We're 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means. So there's a lot of runway left in the high-yield market, and we're excited about what we see."

And I mentioned them briefly earlier. But the growth in ETF, funds under management is driving a lot of activity in the underlying bonds. It's creating a lot of relative value trading activity between the ETF shares and the underlying bond market. Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in block bulk transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see 5 years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next 5 to 10 years is likely to be electronic. And this is why we have no hesitation about investing heavily in the business because the majority of the business today is still conducted through traditional means. And I think the direction of travel is very clear that electronic trading percentage of the market will continue to grow because of the transaction cost benefits that we are delivering and the efficiency it brings to all market participants and the fact that it does allow everybody to participate on a level playing field. So we see many good years ahead in terms of market share gains."

So as the electronic piece of the market grows and, certainly, people in the industry forecast it can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge funds -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform.

It's just our dealer RFQ initiative that we really were pushing throughout 2020 has seen exceptional growth where dealers are coming to us for liquidation of positions. And largely, those liquidations are as a result of a larger block trade that was done, and they have either pieces of that trade that they're unloading or other pieces of a portfolio that they are liquidating. So our -- really, our dealer RFQ growth rate -- and in Q4, in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume. And overall, dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020. So I think that's an area of evidence where we may not be capturing the original block, but we're seeing the benefits of the liquidation of block pieces."

So continued excitement around that.
Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto-Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a timed auto-execution later in the day, so they can still see the success of the position getting executed, but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day. Features where we're providing own methods with trades, partial trades on a larger-size order is all being rolled out in 2021. So just a great deal of activity in the automation area across all of our products.

And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it's still expected to be an active year on any normal basis. It was just last year it was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. So we are -- we would temper our views on new issue secondary trading activity this year relative to last, but we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that. And as I mentioned, the new tools around portfolio and ETF to transfer risk are part of that story. And then the massive increase in credit market participants is part of that story. So we still think, in the short term, yes, we might have a minor headwind from slightly less newly issued bond trading. But in the long term, we're really bullish on overall market volume and market turnover.
We have new protocols, Live Markets, Mid-X, others that are really designed around actively traded bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we think we have a role to play in that market after the bonds break into the secondary market, and we'll continue to push ahead on that as well."

I appreciate the question on the green bond initiative because it's something we work closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients. We certainly made green bonds much more available on the platform.
The nice thing about the solution is we were planting trees for every $1 million of green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. Green bonds and really ESG-related bonds saw record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG-related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our green bond trading for tree solution. Clients are getting -- will be getting certificates for the trees that they planted. We're also excited to pick the #1 Trading for Trees trader on the planet, so they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. 
There's another initiative that's related that I think is worth mentioning because it cuts across many of our products, and that's our Diversity Dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting because it really solves some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG, and this allows diversity of dealers to take advantage of our all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading and attach themselves to that market and participate in trades where they can also save our clients better execution quality and save them money on their actual execution. So our clients are seeing the ability to select a diversity dealer at the same time achieve best execution in their execution. So I expect the diversity Dealer Solution and our green bond solution to be quite exciting solutions as we look into 2021 and all the ESG-related mandates that are coming down from investors across the globe."

We finished the year strong with significant business momentum in the fourth quarter. Market share gains in core products fueled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 51% increase in operating income. 
Revenue for the quarter was $171 million, and EPS of $1.91 was up 45% versus last year. High-grade market share reached a new high of 22.8%, and high-yield share surged to a new record of 17.1%, up from 10.6%. Open Trading volume grew 63% to $218 billion in the fourth quarter, driving estimated transaction cost savings of $225 million to our clients. We closed on the acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub during the quarter, and client onboarding and integration is underway. On the back of the strong results, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, up from $0.60.  
Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results show consistent execution of our growth agenda with strong 5-year and 10-year compound revenue growth of 18% and compound EPS growth of 25%. For full year 2020, revenue growth was 35% and EPS growth was 45%. The results this year reflect strength in all of our core credit products, with record volume and revenue in U.S. high-grade, high-yield, global EM, Eurobonds and munis.  
Total credit trading volume was up 29% in 2020 to $2.6 trillion. Active trading client firms during 2020 surpassed 1,800, about half of which are outside of the U.S. Open Trading grew 33% of our traded volume, up from 26% in 2019. Estimated transaction cost savings from Open Trading skyrocketed to $1.1 billion for the full year. Investors and dealers both initiated record order flow into our Open Trading liquidity pool in 2020.  
Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High-grade and high-yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years. This is one of the factors contributing to our increase in fee capture per million in high-grade. These market conditions are normally not favorable for volume growth. However, market share grew strongly during the second half of the year, driving superior revenue and earnings growth. 
Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading saw sustained growth, even though market conditions normalized in the second half of the year, demonstrating the central role of our marketplace in today's credit market. Open Trading credit volume in the fourth quarter increased 63%, and overall credit trading revenue grew 34% versus last year.  
For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 34% of our global credit trading volume, up from 27% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dealer-initiated Open Trading volume grew 70% year-over-year, and over 1,600 unique client firms completed at least 1 trade in Open Trading during the quarter. Open Trading volume show strong growth trends in each of our core products. We are creating new trading and portfolio opportunities for our clients by delivering over 28,000 Open Trading orders per day, totaling $15 billion in daily notional value.  
During the year, we also delivered important protocol enhancements, including Live Markets, our order book for actively traded corporate bonds as well as Mid-X, our sessions-based matching platform that utilizes our composite plus mid-market data.  
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation, information services and post-trade."

Automated trading volumes rose to $32 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Auto-X trade count grew in the quarter to 163,000, up 28% from the prior year. We are also seeing a healthy adoption of Auto-X across Eurobonds, high-yield and emerging market bonds. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In U.S. investment-grade, the average trade size in 2020 grew 14% compared to 2019 and 40% compared to 2018. 
Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.9 million algos -- algo responses in the fourth quarter, resulting in 308,000 trades. The average number of responses per inquiry remains strong, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform.  
Our new automated liquidity provision solution, Auto-Responder, has seen early traction. This solution allows investors to automatically respond to request for liquidity through Open Trading. In 2020, over $10 billion in notional value was automatically made available through our Auto-Responder solution. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in credit, we are seeing continued demand for our automated trading solutions.  
Slide 8 provides an update on product diversification. Market data and analytics have never been more in demand than today. Information services revenue reached $34.3 million for the year, with a 5-year compounded growth rate of 11%. Our unique data solutions are assisting bond pricing and liquidity providers on our trading platform, thus helping to generate greater transaction volume.  
In the years following the implementation of MiFID II, our post-trade services business has grown substantially. Post-trade revenues were $19.5 million in 2020, up 23% year-over-year. Reflecting hour commitment to post-trade, we recently announced the completed acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub, which adds significant client penetration in Continental Europe and strengthens our data capabilities.  
Our Rates business hit a critical milestone in the fourth quarter by integrating U.S. Treasury trading capabilities within the MarketAxess platform, providing a centralized fixed income trading solution with a full Click-To-Trade suite of products. This allows current credit trading users to seamlessly access this unique rates trading solution with complete post-trade integration. We also launched our net hedging solution in Q4, which supports our credit trading clients' ability to efficiently hedge their corporate bond transactions.  
Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 26% year-over-year to $318 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and an increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year-over-year to 22.8%, while estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 10% year-over-year. 
Volumes in our other credit category were up 36% year-over-year to $321 billion for the quarter. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the 74% increase in U.S. high-yield volume.  
Eurobond volumes experienced a 31% increase, and emerging market bond volume grew by 19% year-over-year. I am also excited to report that our municipal bond volume doubled year-over-year.  
Our Rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2019 in what was a difficult market environment. We believe the investment made in new trading technology, expanded product coverage and enhanced data tools will continue to differentiate our Rates offering. 
Our 2020 green bond trading initiative was very successful, with $27 billion green bonds traded on the platform, resulting in nearly 135,000 trees planted in critical regions across the world. With 3 trading days remaining in January, estimated U.S. TRACE market volumes are running more than 10% above January 2020, while estimated Eurobond and emerging market volumes are similar to January 2020. Estimated combined market share across our 4 core products is seasonally below the fourth quarter levels, but well above the January 2020 levels. Our month-to-date average daily trading volume in credit products is up more than 20% versus January 2020.  
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."

On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $171 million, up 32% year-over-year. The 31% increase in credit trading volume and higher overall credit fee capture resulted in a 33% uplift in commissions.  
Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year, and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%.  
The effective tax rate was 19.2% in the fourth quarter, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 20%, which was right at the low end of our 2020 guidance range.  
On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher U.S. high-grade fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. A combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. 
Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution of fees was due to variances in unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans.  
Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in head count of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles.  
Clearing costs were up almost 50%, reflecting the 63% increase in Open Trading volume. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we expect our steady-state third-party clearing costs for credit trading, measured as a percentage of Open Trading revenue or on a per-ticket basis, to decline by upwards of 1/3. Excluding M&A transaction and integration costs and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the regulatory hub acquisition, expenses were up 12% in the fourth quarter.  
On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $489 million, and free cash flow reached a record $340 million in 2020. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $150 million and capital expenditures were $46 million in 2020. With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past 5 years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation.  
Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants.  
During the fourth quarter, we also entered into a new $500 million revolving credit facility with the syndicated banks to support our clearing activities and add financial flexibility. There were no borrowings outstanding at year-end under this facility. 
On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2021 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses consistent with the trend over the past several years. 
We have built the plan using a sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance. This guidance range reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition, including an estimated $5 million for amortization of acquired intangibles and $5 million in nonrecurring integration costs. Excluding the expenses related to regulatory reporting hub, the midpoint in the guidance range would represent an approximate 13% year-over-year increase in expenses on a constant currency basis.  
2021 capital expenditures are expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, of which roughly 2/3 relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform.  
We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2021 will range from 22% to 24%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2020 is driven by lower estimated excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Based on the expected timing for realizing the excess tax benefits, the effective tax rate will likely be in the 20% range in the first quarter and then the 24% to 25% range in the second, third and fourth quarters.

So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. I'd say we're guiding to",536,"Yes. Sure, Dan. Happy to take that one. So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. 
I'd say we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGR. So if you look at the expense CAGR over the past 5 or 10 years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history. And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders would continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. 
But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path.  
Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really headcount-driven. If you think about the 80-or-so people that we added in 2020, we have plans to add another 60-or-so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021. So it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase.  
The other piece. You look at -- and this will be along the investment theme. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in trading protocols and the platform. And specifically, it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items.  
And I'd give you 2 other items, just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now, in our models, we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers.  
The other one, just to give you a little bit of color. We're expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just 2 minutes on that because there's 2 components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit and then you have clearing costs related to U.S. Treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat. The savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the U.K., those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in U.S. Treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady-state savings from the transition in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset. So I just want to give you a little bit of color on that.  
Boy, that was a long-winded answer, wasn't it?"

And we have the costs associated with clearing, Open Trading, corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the U.S., transition to the settlement agent in the U.K. And that's what we've been talking about, a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of 1/3.  
But the second component, and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction, the second component is clearing cost for U.S. Treasury trading, where MarketAxess intermediates those trades. In the near term, we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries run somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term. But you have to look at those 2 pieces.  
Now in the fourth quarter, and I -- admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing cost. So for example, as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit. Clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running the prior year with a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledged that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. 
We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses. Third-party clearing cost expenses for credit, we believe that the savings will be upwards of 1/3 on a steady-state basis, whether you look at it as a percentage of Open Trading revenue on a per-ticket basis, on a per-million traded basis. We're still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with, again, with -- we have 2 elements to our clearing costs, both corporate bonds and then on the treasury side."

Net hedging was launched late in the fourth quarter and rolled out on a pilot basis. It is now go live in Q1, and we're seeing, obviously, a long list of clients that have had interest in that net hedging solution for some time. So the client takeup should roll out here in the first and second quarter with additional enhancements to net hedging over the first half of the year.
With regard to the fully live rate solution, a couple of movements there. I think one of the more exciting things is our integrated trading solution, fully Click-To-Trade, liquid streams in both on-the-run and, more importantly, our very unique off-the-run streaming solution, which really no other platforms have streaming off-the-runs to institutional clients. So that's new as part of our offering.  
We also plan to launch RFQ in the first half of this year. So we'd have a combined Click-To-Trade. So for your more liquid front end of the curve would be Click-To-Trade solutions, and then you'd be able to RFQ across the curve for larger trade size or less liquid products. And that right now is being communicated to our clients, and the demand is quite high, particularly around the events of last year and the liquidity constraints that were on some of the other platforms offering rates trading. So there's some excitement from our clients on providing not only a full breadth of product with unique off-the-run Click-To-Trade solutions, but also having a unique liquidity on the platform similar to how we run our credit trading solutions."

But I'm glad you pointed out 2 enormous growth opportunities for us. And we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020, and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead.
And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there's a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know, the muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world. So Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value where we can connect all market participants into our all-to-all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade.  
EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic. And global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM, but 26 local markets all in 1 marketplace, with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all-to-all or Open Trading. 
So we think we've got a tremendous opportunity there. We're excited about the signs we see at beginning of electronic trading adoption in important areas like Asia. We are seeing really good client takeup going on there, and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are, as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large. And munis and global EM are just 2 of many examples that we're looking at right now.
And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top 5 banks alone had global FICC revenue of $68 billion. MarketAxess had a record year of about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see as the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity. And that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business."

And again, the automated trading solution has been largely adopted by clients for small-ticket solution. It hasn't been targeted for larger ticket. However, as we think about developing the automated suite of products, our target is for block trades, particularly when you start to integrate both Auto-Responder, which is the ability to provide liquidity to other parties who are requesting price, and Auto-X and putting together those products into a single suite or a single order similar to a client algorithm would allow larger block orders to provide liquidity throughout the day and then Auto-X at the end of the day. So both liquidity provider and a liquidity taker all-in-one automated solution. 
Those are some of the targets that we have in 2021 as part of the initiatives around automation. But today, as we see the current client experience, the execution quality for trades, somewhere around $2 million in size is quite similar to anything $5 million in size.

Thanks for that, Kyle. And you're right. This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess, seeing the inflection point in high-yield during the course of 2020.
But I'd point to a number of things. It's the size of our open order trading -- Open Trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading. And the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution and the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving.
I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high-yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients is through the MarketAxess system. 
The hedge funds are getting much more involved in our high-yield platform and finding great trading opportunities. And then there's significant growth going on in systematic credit trading strategies. And we see a lot of activity in rebalancing from systematic strategies coming into the high-yield platform. So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go.
The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last 3 or 4 quarters is that a year ago, the bulk of our activity in high-yield was really in $1 million and under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high-yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we're really pleased with the results, but we think there's a long way to go. We're 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means. So there's a lot of runway left in the high-yield market, and we're excited about what we see."

It's creating a lot of relative value trading activity between the ETF shares and the underlying bond market. Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in block bulk transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. 
So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see 5 years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next 5 to 10 years is likely to be electronic. And this is why we have no hesitation about investing heavily in the business. Because the majority of the business today is still conducted through traditional means. And I think the direction of travel is very clear that electronic trading percentage of the market will continue to grow because of the transaction cost benefits that we are delivering and the efficiency it brings to all market participants and the fact that it does allow everybody to participate on a level playing field.

So as the electronic piece of the market grows and, certainly, people in the industry forecast it can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. 
And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge funds -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform.

So our -- really, our dealer RFQ growth rate -- and in Q4, in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume. And overall, dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020.

Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto-Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a timed auto-execution later in the day, so they can still see the success of the position getting executed, but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day.

I'm happy to take a shot at that, Brian. But I think what you're referring to is the very robust and record levels of new issuance last year and how that impacts new issue activity this year. And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that",273,"Sure. I'm happy to take a shot at that, Brian. But I think what you're referring to is the very robust and record levels of new issuance last year and how that impacts new issue activity this year. And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it's still expected to be an active year on any normal basis. It was just last year, it was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. 
So we are -- we would temper our views on new issue secondary trading activity this year relative to last. But we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that. And as I mentioned, the new tools around portfolio and ETF to transfer risk are part of that story. And then the massive increase in credit market participants is part of that story. So we still think, in the short term, yes, we might have a minor headwind from slightly less newly issued bond trading. But in the long term, we're really bullish on overall market volume and market turnover.
We have new protocols, Live Markets, Mid-X, others that are really designed around actively traded bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we think we have a role to play in that market after the bonds break into the secondary market, and we'll continue to push ahead on that as well."

So on the info services side, Chris had some comments that full year revenue was up around 12%. And even when you look at the 5-year compounded annual growth rate for information services, it's right around that 11% or 12% range.
In terms of a little bit of guidance for 2021, we've got a pretty decent pipeline as we enter 2021. We think we can deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. And we had new data sales last year of about $6.5 million. It was about $5.5 million the year before that. We've got a pretty good pipeline entering 2021. But I just would reiterate what we've said in the past around data that we're also using data to incent clients to trade more on the platform. And that's a principal use of the content that we're capturing. So we expect to grow the info services revenue double digits. But again, it is an important piece of the information we're delivering to help clients make pricing decisions.
On the post-trade side, take it in 2 pieces on the post-trade side. And we have given some color on regulatory reporting hub what the impact would be. We gave some color in the third quarter. Take that piece, it's somewhere around $1 million per month in revenue is what we're expecting, maybe a little bit higher than that what we're expecting in 2021. On the organic side, we're expecting double-digit growth on the organic side, and it's really a full year impact of SFTR reporting, which came online midway through 2020.
And it's also -- we've been adding clients organically. So the combination of those 2 items, we think we're looking at double-digit organic growth, overlay regulatory reporting hub, $1 million or so in revenue a month. And that gives you a sense for what we're expecting for 2021."

I appreciate the question on the green bond initiative because it's something we work closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients. We certainly made green bonds much more available on the platform.
The nice thing about the solution is we were planting trees for every $1 million of green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. 
Green bonds and really ESG-related bonds saw a record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG-related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our green bond trading for tree solution. Clients are getting -- will be getting certificates for the trees that they planted. We're also excited to pick the #1 trading for trees trader on the planet, so they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. 
There's another initiative that's related that I think is worth mentioning because it cuts across many of our products. And that's our diversity dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting because it really solves some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG. And this allows diversity dealers to take advantage of our all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading, and attach themselves to that market and participate in trades where they can also save our clients -- better execution quality and save them money on their actual execution. 
So our clients are seeing the ability to select a diversity dealer at the same time as achieve best execution in their execution. So I expect the diversity dealer solution and our green bond solution to be quite exciting solutions as we look into 2021 and all the ESG-related mandates that are coming down from investors across the globe."

We finished the year strong with significant business momentum in the fourth quarter. Market share gains in core products fueled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 51% increase in operating income. 
Revenue for the quarter was $171 million, and EPS of $1.91 was up 45% versus last year. High-grade market share reached a new high of 22.8%, and high-yield share surged to a new record of 17.1%, up from 10.6%. Open Trading volume grew 63% to $218 billion in the fourth quarter, driving estimated transaction cost savings of $225 million to our clients. We closed on the acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub during the quarter, and client onboarding and integration is underway. On the back of the strong results, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, up from $0.60. 
Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results show consistent execution of our growth agenda with strong 5-year and 10-year compound revenue growth of 18% and compound EPS growth of 25%. For full year 2020, revenue growth was 35% and EPS growth was 45%. The results this year reflect strength in all of our core credit products, with record volume and revenue in U.S. high-grade, high-yield, global EM, Eurobonds and munis. 
Total credit trading volume was up 29% in 2020 to $2.6 trillion. Active trading client firms during 2020 surpassed 1,800, about half of which are outside of the U.S. Open Trading grew 33% of our traded volume, up from 26% in 2019. Estimated transaction cost savings from Open Trading skyrocketed to $1.1 billion for the full year. Investors and dealers both initiated record order flow into our Open Trading liquidity pool in 2020. 
Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High-grade and high-yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years. This is one of the factors contributing to our increase in fee capture per million in high-grade. These market conditions are normally not favorable for volume growth. However, market share grew strongly during the second half of the year, driving superior revenue and earnings growth. 
Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading saw sustained growth, even though market conditions normalized in the second half of the year, demonstrating the central role of our marketplace in today's credit market. Open Trading credit volume in the fourth quarter increased 63%, and overall credit trading revenue grew 34% versus last year. 
For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 34% of our global credit trading volume, up from 27% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dealer-initiated Open Trading volume grew 70% year-over-year, and over 1,600 unique client firms completed at least 1 trade in Open Trading during the quarter. Open Trading volume show strong growth trends in each of our core products. We are creating new trading and portfolio opportunities for our clients by delivering over 28,000 Open Trading orders per day, totaling $15 billion in daily notional value. 
During the year, we also delivered important protocol enhancements, including Live Markets, our order book for actively traded corporate bonds as well as Mid-X, our sessions-based matching platform that utilizes our composite plus mid-market data. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation, information services and post-trade."

Automated trading volumes rose to $32 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Auto-X trade count grew in the quarter to 163,000, up 28% from the prior year. We are also seeing a healthy adoption of Auto-X across Eurobonds, high-yield and emerging market bonds. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In U.S. investment-grade, the average trade size in 2020 grew 14% compared to 2019 and 40% compared to 2018. 
Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.9 million algos -- algo responses in the fourth quarter, resulting in 308,000 trades. The average number of responses per inquiry remains strong, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform. 
Our new automated liquidity provision solution, Auto-Responder, has seen early traction. This solution allows investors to automatically respond to request for liquidity through Open Trading. In 2020, over $10 billion in notional value was automatically made available through our Auto-Responder solution. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in credit, we are seeing continued demand for our automated trading solutions. 
Slide 8 provides an update on product diversification. Market data and analytics have never been more in demand than today. Information services revenue reached $34.3 million for the year, with a 5-year compounded growth rate of 11%. Our unique data solutions are assisting bond pricing and liquidity providers on our trading platform, thus helping to generate greater transaction volume. 
In the years following the implementation of MiFID II, our post-trade services business has grown substantially. Post-trade revenues were $19.5 million in 2020, up 23% year-over-year. Reflecting hour commitment to post-trade, we recently announced the completed acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub, which adds significant client penetration in Continental Europe and strengthens our data capabilities. 
Our Rates business hit a critical milestone in the fourth quarter by integrating U.S. Treasury trading capabilities within the MarketAxess platform, providing a centralized fixed income trading solution with a full Click-To-Trade suite of products. This allows current credit trading users to seamlessly access this unique rates trading solution with complete post-trade integration. We also launched our net hedging solution in Q4, which supports our credit trading clients' ability to efficiently hedge their corporate bond transactions. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 26% year-over-year to $318 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and an increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year-over-year to 22.8%, while estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 10% year-over-year. 
Volumes in our other credit category were up 36% year-over-year to $321 billion for the quarter. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the 74% increase in U.S. high-yield volume. 
Eurobond volumes experienced a 31% increase, and emerging market bond volume grew by 19% year-over-year. I am also excited to report that our municipal bond volume doubled year-over-year. 
Our Rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2019 in what was a difficult market environment. We believe the investment made in new trading technology, expanded product coverage and enhanced data tools will continue to differentiate our Rates offering. 
Our 2020 green bond trading initiative was very successful, with $27 billion green bonds traded on the platform, resulting in nearly 135,000 trees planted in critical regions across the world. With 3 trading days remaining in January, estimated U.S. TRACE market volumes are running more than 10% above January 2020, while estimated Eurobond and emerging market volumes are similar to January 2020. Estimated combined market share across our 4 core products is seasonally below the fourth quarter levels, but well above the January 2020 levels. Our month-to-date average daily trading volume in credit products is up more than 20% versus January 2020. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."

On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $171 million, up 32% year-over-year. The 31% increase in credit trading volume and higher overall credit fee capture resulted in a 33% uplift in commissions. 
Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year, and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%. 
The effective tax rate was 19.2% in the fourth quarter, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 20%, which was right at the low end of our 2020 guidance range. 
On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher U.S. high-grade fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. A combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. 
Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution of fees was due to variances in unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans. 
Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Clearing costs were up almost 50%, reflecting the 63% increase in Open Trading volume. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we expect our steady-state third-party clearing costs for credit trading, measured as a percentage of Open Trading revenue or on a per-ticket basis, to decline by upwards of 1/3. Excluding M&A transaction and integration costs and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the regulatory hub acquisition, expenses were up 12% in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $489 million, and free cash flow reached a record $340 million in 2020. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $150 million and capital expenditures were $46 million in 2020. With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past 5 years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation. 
Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants. 
During the fourth quarter, we also entered into a new $500 million revolving credit facility with the syndicated banks to support our clearing activities and add financial flexibility. There were no borrowings outstanding at year-end under this facility. 
On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2021 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses consistent with the trend over the past several years. 
We have built the plan using a sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance. This guidance range reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition, including an estimated $5 million for amortization of acquired intangibles and $5 million in nonrecurring integration costs. Excluding the expenses related to regulatory reporting hub, the midpoint in the guidance range would represent an approximate 13% year-over-year increase in expenses on a constant currency basis. 
2021 capital expenditures are expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, of which roughly 2/3 relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform. 
We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2021 will range from 22% to 24%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2020 is driven by lower estimated excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Based on the expected timing for realizing the excess tax benefits, the effective tax rate will likely be in the 20% range in the first quarter and then the 24% to 25% range in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. I'd say we're guiding to",536,"Yes. Sure, Dan. Happy to take that one. So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. 
I'd say we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGR. So if you look at the expense CAGR over the past 5 or 10 years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history. And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders would continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. 
But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path. 
Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really headcount-driven. If you think about the 80-or-so people that we added in 2020, we have plans to add another 60-or-so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021. So it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase. 
The other piece. You look at -- and this will be along the investment theme. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in trading protocols and the platform. And specifically, it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items. 
And I'd give you 2 other items, just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now, in our models, we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers. 
The other one, just to give you a little bit of color. We're expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just 2 minutes on that because there's 2 components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit and then you have clearing costs related to U.S. Treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat. The savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the U.K., those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in U.S. Treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady-state savings from the transition in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset. So I just want to give you a little bit of color on that. 
Boy, that was a long-winded answer, wasn't it?"

And we have the costs associated with clearing, Open Trading, corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the U.S., transition to the settlement agent in the U.K. And that's what we've been talking about, a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of 1/3. 
But the second component, and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction, the second component is clearing cost for U.S. Treasury trading, where MarketAxess intermediates those trades. In the near term, we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries run somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term. But you have to look at those 2 pieces. 
Now in the fourth quarter, and I -- admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing cost. So for example, as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit. Clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running the prior year with a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledged that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. 
We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses. Third-party clearing cost expenses for credit, we believe that the savings will be upwards of 1/3 on a steady-state basis, whether you look at it as a percentage of Open Trading revenue on a per-ticket basis, on a per-million traded basis. We're still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with, again, with -- we have 2 elements to our clearing costs, both corporate bonds and then on the treasury side."

So the client take-up should roll out here in the first and second quarter with additional enhancements to net hedging over the first half of the year.
With regard to the fully live rate solution, a couple of movements there. I think one of the more exciting things is our integrated trading solution, fully Click-To-Trade, liquid streams in both on-the-run and, more importantly, our very unique off-the-run streaming solution, which really no other platforms have streaming off-the-runs to institutional clients. So that's new as part of our offering. 
We also plan to launch RFQ in the first half of this year. So we'd have a combined Click-To-Trade. So for your more liquid front end of the curve would be Click-To-Trade solutions, and then you'd be able to RFQ across the curve for larger trade size or less liquid products. And that right now is being communicated to our clients, and the demand is quite high, particularly around the events of last year and the liquidity constraints that were on some of the other platforms offering rates trading. So there's some excitement from our clients on providing not only a full breadth of product with unique off-the-run Click-To-Trade solutions, but also having a unique liquidity on the platform similar to how we run our credit trading solutions."

But I'm glad you pointed out 2 enormous growth opportunities for us. And we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020, and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead.
And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there's a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know, the muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world. So Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value where we can connect all market participants into our all-to-all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade. 
EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic. And global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM, but 26 local markets all in one marketplace, with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all-to-all or Open Trading. 
So we think we've got a tremendous opportunity there. We're excited about the signs we see at beginning of electronic trading adoption in important areas like Asia. We are seeing really good client take-up going on there, and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are, as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large. And munis and global EM are just 2 of many examples that we're looking at right now.
And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top 5 banks alone had global FICC revenue of $68 billion. MarketAxess had a record year of about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see as the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity. And that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business."

And again, the automated trading solution has been largely adopted by clients for small-ticket solution. It hasn't been targeted for larger ticket.

So both liquidity provider and a liquidity taker all-in-one automated solution. 
Those are some of the targets that we have in 2021 as part of the initiatives around automation.

Thanks for that, Kyle. And you're right. This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess, seeing the inflection point in high-yield during the course of 2020.
But I'd point to a number of things. It's the size of our open order trading -- Open Trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading. And the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution and the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving.
I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high-yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients is through the MarketAxess system. 
The hedge funds are getting much more involved in our high-yield platform and finding great trading opportunities. And then there's significant growth going on in systematic credit trading strategies. And we see a lot of activity in rebalancing from systematic strategies coming into the high-yield platform. So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go.
The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last 3 or 4 quarters is that a year ago, the bulk of our activity in high-yield was really in $1 million and under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high-yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we're really pleased with the results, but we think there's a long way to go. We're 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means. So there's a lot of runway left in the high-yield market, and we're excited about what we see."

Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in block bulk transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. 
So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see 5 years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next 5 to 10 years is likely to be electronic. And this is why we have no hesitation about investing heavily in the business. Because the majority of the business today is still conducted through traditional means. And I think the direction of travel is very clear that electronic trading percentage of the market will continue to grow because of the transaction cost benefits that we are delivering and the efficiency it brings to all market participants and the fact that it does allow everybody to participate on a level playing field.

So as the electronic piece of the market grows and, certainly, people in the industry forecast it can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. 
And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge funds -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform.

It's just our dealer RFQ initiative that we really were pushing throughout 2020 has seen exceptional growth where dealers are coming to us for liquidation of positions. 
And largely, those liquidations are as a result of a larger block trade that was done. And they have either pieces of that trade that they're unloading or other pieces of a portfolio that they are liquidating. So our -- really, our dealer RFQ growth rate -- and in Q4, in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume. And overall, dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020. So I think that's an area of evidence where we may not be capturing the original block, but we're seeing the benefits of the liquidation of block pieces."

I think I said a year ago that I loved munis. And if you look at our performance in munis in 2020, we're more excited about the opportunity in 2021 given our growth rate. We had a record day for munis in January, just recently. So continued excitement around that.
Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto-Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a timed auto-execution later in the day, so they can still see the success of the position getting executed, but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day. Features where we're providing own methods with trades, partial trades on a larger-size order is all being rolled out in 2021. So just a great deal of activity in the automation area across all of our products.
And as I mentioned in talking points, we're seeing automation uptake across not only just high-grade and high yield, but also Eurobonds, EM as well. So pretty big agenda for automation in 2021. I'm not sure if I answered your question, Rich."

But I think what you're referring to is the very robust and record levels of new issuance last year and how that impacts new issue activity this year. And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it's still expected to be an active year on any normal basis. It was just last year, it was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. 
So we are -- we would temper our views on new issue secondary trading activity this year relative to last. But we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that. And as I mentioned, the new tools around portfolio and ETF to transfer risk are part of that story. And then the massive increase in credit market participants is part of that story. So we still think, in the short term, yes, we might have a minor headwind from slightly less newly issued bond trading. But in the long term, we're really bullish on overall market volume and market turnover.
We have new protocols, Live Markets, Mid-X, others that are really designed around actively traded bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we think we have a role to play in that market after the bonds break into the secondary market, and we'll continue to push ahead on that as well."

In terms of a little bit of guidance for 2021, we've got a pretty decent pipeline as we enter 2021. We think we can deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. And we had new data sales last year of about $6.5 million. It was about $5.5 million the year before that. We've got a pretty good pipeline entering 2021. But I just would reiterate what we've said in the past around data that we're also using data to incent clients to trade more on the platform. And that's a principal use of the content that we're capturing. So we expect to grow the info services revenue double digits. But again, it is an important piece of the information we're delivering to help clients make pricing decisions.
On the post-trade side, take it in 2 pieces on the post-trade side. And we have given some color on regulatory reporting hub what the impact would be. We gave some color in the third quarter. Take that piece, it's somewhere around $1 million per month in revenue is what we're expecting, maybe a little bit higher than that what we're expecting in 2021. On the organic side, we're expecting double-digit growth on the organic side, and it's really a full year impact of SFTR reporting, which came online midway through 2020.
And it's also -- we've been adding clients organically. So the combination of those 2 items, we think we're looking at double-digit organic growth, overlay regulatory reporting hub, $1 million or so in revenue a month. And that gives you a sense for what we're expecting for 2021."

I appreciate the question on the green bond initiative because it's something we work closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients. We certainly made green bonds much more available on the platform.
The nice thing about the solution is we were planting trees for every $1 million of green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. 
Green bonds and really ESG-related bonds saw a record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG-related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our green bond trading for tree solution. Clients are getting -- will be getting certificates for the trees that they planted. We're also excited to pick the #1 trading for trees trader on the planet, so they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. 
There's another initiative that's related that I think is worth mentioning because it cuts across many of our products. And that's our diversity dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting because it really solves some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG. And this allows diversity dealers to take advantage of our all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading, and attach themselves to that market and participate in trades where they can also save our clients -- better execution quality and save them money on their actual execution. 
So our clients are seeing the ability to select a diversity dealer at the same time as achieve best execution in their execution. So I expect the diversity dealer solution and our green bond solution to be quite exciting solutions as we look into 2021 and all the ESG-related mandates that are coming down from investors across the globe."

We finished the year strong with significant business momentum in the fourth quarter. Market share gains in core products fueled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 51% increase in operating income. 
Revenue for the quarter was $171 million, and EPS of $1.91 was up 45% versus last year. High-grade market share reached a new high of 22.8%, and high-yield share surged to a new record of 17.1%, up from 10.6%. Open Trading volume grew 63% to $218 billion in the fourth quarter, driving estimated transaction cost savings of $225 million to our clients. We closed on the acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub during the quarter, and client onboarding and integration is underway. On the back of the strong results, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, up from $0.60. 
Slide 4 highlights our record full year results. Our long-term results show consistent execution of our growth agenda with strong 5-year and 10-year compound revenue growth of 18% and compound EPS growth of 25%. For full year 2020, revenue growth was 35% and EPS growth was 45%. The results this year reflect strength in all of our core credit products, with record volume and revenue in U.S. high-grade, high-yield, global EM, Eurobonds and munis. 
Total credit trading volume was up 29% in 2020 to $2.6 trillion. Active trading client firms during 2020 surpassed 1,800, about half of which are outside of the U.S. Open Trading grew 33% of our traded volume, up from 26% in 2019. Estimated transaction cost savings from Open Trading skyrocketed to $1.1 billion for the full year. Investors and dealers both initiated record order flow into our Open Trading liquidity pool in 2020. 
Slide 5 provides an update on market conditions. As of year-end, high-grade credit spreads have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Credit spread volatility has also been declining over the last several quarters. High-grade and high-yield bond issuance peaked in Q2 and fell back to more normal levels in Q4. As a result of the combination of lower volatility and more normal new issue activity, TRACE volume was up just 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
Average years to maturity for corporate bonds traded on the system remained at the high end of the historical range at 9.4 years. This is one of the factors contributing to our increase in fee capture per million in high-grade. These market conditions are normally not favorable for volume growth. However, market share grew strongly during the second half of the year, driving superior revenue and earnings growth. 
Slide 6 provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading saw sustained growth, even though market conditions normalized in the second half of the year, demonstrating the central role of our marketplace in today's credit market. Open Trading credit volume in the fourth quarter increased 63%, and overall credit trading revenue grew 34% versus last year. 
For the quarter, Open Trading represented approximately 34% of our global credit trading volume, up from 27% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Dealer-initiated Open Trading volume grew 70% year-over-year, and over 1,600 unique client firms completed at least 1 trade in Open Trading during the quarter. Open Trading volume show strong growth trends in each of our core products. We are creating new trading and portfolio opportunities for our clients by delivering over 28,000 Open Trading orders per day, totaling $15 billion in daily notional value. 
During the year, we also delivered important protocol enhancements, including Live Markets, our order book for actively traded corporate bonds as well as Mid-X, our sessions-based matching platform that utilizes our composite plus mid-market data. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on automation, information services and post-trade."

Auto-X trade count grew in the quarter to 163,000, up 28% from the prior year. We are also seeing a healthy adoption of Auto-X across Eurobonds, high-yield and emerging market bonds. The average trade size conducted through Auto-X is also rising. In U.S. investment-grade, the average trade size in 2020 grew 14% compared to 2019 and 40% compared to 2018. 
Clients continue to increase the size of their orders as they gain comfort with the execution quality of our Auto-X solution. The use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 3.9 million algos -- algo responses in the fourth quarter, resulting in 308,000 trades. The average number of responses per inquiry remains strong, which ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform. 
Our new automated liquidity provision solution, Auto-Responder, has seen early traction. This solution allows investors to automatically respond to request for liquidity through Open Trading. In 2020, over $10 billion in notional value was automatically made available through our Auto-Responder solution. As the overall share of electronic trading grows in credit, we are seeing continued demand for our automated trading solutions. 
Slide 8 provides an update on product diversification. Market data and analytics have never been more in demand than today. Information services revenue reached $34.3 million for the year, with a 5-year compounded growth rate of 11%. Our unique data solutions are assisting bond pricing and liquidity providers on our trading platform, thus helping to generate greater transaction volume. 
In the years following the implementation of MiFID II, our post-trade services business has grown substantially. Post-trade revenues were $19.5 million in 2020, up 23% year-over-year. Reflecting hour commitment to post-trade, we recently announced the completed acquisition of Deutsche Börse's Regulatory Reporting Hub, which adds significant client penetration in Continental Europe and strengthens our data capabilities. 
Our Rates business hit a critical milestone in the fourth quarter by integrating U.S. Treasury trading capabilities within the MarketAxess platform, providing a centralized fixed income trading solution with a full Click-To-Trade suite of products. This allows current credit trading users to seamlessly access this unique rates trading solution with complete post-trade integration. We also launched our net hedging solution in Q4, which supports our credit trading clients' ability to efficiently hedge their corporate bond transactions. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 26% year-over-year to $318 billion for the quarter, largely due to market share gains and an increase in market volumes. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share increased by 2.8 percentage points year-over-year to 22.8%, while estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 10% year-over-year. 
Volumes in our other credit category were up 36% year-over-year to $321 billion for the quarter. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the 74% increase in U.S. high-yield volume. 
Eurobond volumes experienced a 31% increase, and emerging market bond volume grew by 19% year-over-year. I am also excited to report that our municipal bond volume doubled year-over-year. 
Our Rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2019 in what was a difficult market environment. We believe the investment made in new trading technology, expanded product coverage and enhanced data tools will continue to differentiate our Rates offering. 
Our 2020 green bond trading initiative was very successful, with $27 billion green bonds traded on the platform, resulting in nearly 135,000 trees planted in critical regions across the world. With 3 trading days remaining in January, estimated U.S. TRACE market volumes are running more than 10% above January 2020, while estimated Eurobond and emerging market volumes are similar to January 2020. Estimated combined market share across our 4 core products is seasonally below the fourth quarter levels, but well above the January 2020 levels. Our month-to-date average daily trading volume in credit products is up more than 20% versus January 2020. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."

On Slide 10, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was $171 million, up 32% year-over-year. The 31% increase in credit trading volume and higher overall credit fee capture resulted in a 33% uplift in commissions. 
Post-trade services revenue was up 67% to $6.6 million and reflects 1 month of trade reporting activity from clients added to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Operating income was up 51% year-over-year, and operating margin reached 53.5% during the quarter. Full year 2020 operating margin was up more than 5 percentage points to 54.4%. 
The effective tax rate was 19.2% in the fourth quarter, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 20%, which was right at the low end of our 2020 guidance range. 
On Slide 11, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 40% year-over-year, driven by the increase in credit trading volume and higher U.S. high-grade fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $12 versus the third quarter level, but $17 higher year-over-year. A combination of shorter duration and higher weighting to larger trade sizes accounted for the sequential decline in fee capture. 
Our other credit category fee capture decreased by $6 on a sequential basis, but was $11 higher year-over-year. The slight drop in sequential other credit fee capture was principally due to a mix shift with a greater weighting towards Eurobonds and emerging markets sovereign bonds. The sequential change in distribution of fees was due to variances in unused minimum commitment fees under all variable dealer plans. 
Slide 12 provides you with the expense detail. The year-over-year rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 79 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development and the trading platform, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Clearing costs were up almost 50%, reflecting the 63% increase in Open Trading volume. As I mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we expect our steady-state third-party clearing costs for credit trading, measured as a percentage of Open Trading revenue or on a per-ticket basis, to decline by upwards of 1/3. Excluding M&A transaction and integration costs and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the regulatory hub acquisition, expenses were up 12% in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of December 31 were $489 million, and free cash flow reached a record $340 million in 2020. Dividends and share repurchases aggregated $150 million and capital expenditures were $46 million in 2020. With the announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, we have tripled the dividend level over the past 5 years, which matches the growth in earnings and free cash flow generation. 
Our Board recently authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program to replace the plan expiring at the end of March. As has been our practice, the principal purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset dilution from employee equity grants. 
During the fourth quarter, we also entered into a new $500 million revolving credit facility with the syndicated banks to support our clearing activities and add financial flexibility. There were no borrowings outstanding at year-end under this facility. 
On Slide 14, we have laid out our 2021 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures and the effective tax rate. We expect that total 2021 expenses will be in the range of $362 million to $382 million. Employee compensation and benefit costs are expected to represent around 50% of total expenses consistent with the trend over the past several years. 
We have built the plan using a sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.35, which has the effect of adding around $4 million to the expense guidance. This guidance range reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the regulatory reporting hub acquisition, including an estimated $5 million for amortization of acquired intangibles and $5 million in nonrecurring integration costs. Excluding the expenses related to regulatory reporting hub, the midpoint in the guidance range would represent an approximate 13% year-over-year increase in expenses on a constant currency basis. 
2021 capital expenditures are expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, of which roughly 2/3 relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and enhancements to the trading platform. 
We expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2021 will range from 22% to 24%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2020 is driven by lower estimated excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Based on the expected timing for realizing the excess tax benefits, the effective tax rate will likely be in the 20% range in the first quarter and then the 24% to 25% range in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

Looking at the organic expense growth slightly higher than where I think you started out last year in terms of what you were going to spend on, could you maybe highlight some of the areas of spend and kind of initiatives that might be different year-over-year?

So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. I'd say we're guiding to",536,"Yes. Sure, Dan. Happy to take that one. So on the expense guidance, we try to give you the pieces. It's easier to explain in the 2 pieces which is the organic growth and then the regulatory reporting hub overlay on top of that. 
I'd say we're guiding to a 13% constant currency increase. It probably shouldn't be a surprise. If you look at history, Rick had given some color on the revenue and earnings CAGR. So if you look at the expense CAGR over the past 5 or 10 years, it's 15%. So the 13% that we're guiding to is really right in line with history. And I would tell you also that I'd suggest that shareholders would continue to support that type of continuing investment if you look at the revenue and earnings growth that we've delivered over the years. 
But put that aside, in terms of the pieces, the -- on the organic piece, we entered 2021 with a full investment agenda. We've got new protocols, newer product areas, geographic expansion efforts. So we're continuing on that investment path. 
Individual line items, and this won't be a surprise, where you're going to see most of the absolute expense increase is in comp and benefits. It's really headcount-driven. If you think about the 80-or-so people that we added in 2020, we have plans to add another 60-or-so personnel to support our growth agenda in 2021. So it won't be a surprise that that's the line item that will dominate the expense increase. 
The other piece. You look at -- and this will be along the investment theme. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be 25% or so higher than 2020 on an organic basis. And that reflects the investment we've been making in trading protocols and the platform. And specifically, it revolves around the amortization of software development costs. So those are the big items. 
And I'd give you 2 other items, just to give you a little bit of color. Yes, we expect an increase in marketing and advertising and G&A expenses, which would be driven by the resumption of T&E. Right now, in our models, we've got travel and entertainment resuming sometime in the second half of the year. So you'll see some increase there, but that's not what's dominating the absolute numbers. 
The other one, just to give you a little bit of color. We're expecting clearing costs to be flattish year-over-year. And I do want to spend just 2 minutes on that because there's 2 components to clearing costs. You have clearing costs related to credit and then you have clearing costs related to U.S. Treasuries. And we're budgeting in the aggregate to be flat. The savings that we anticipate from going to self-clearing and transitioning settlement agents in the U.K., those savings will likely be offset by an increase in expected volume from Open Trading and an increase in U.S. Treasury trading volume. So even though we're expecting steady-state savings from the transition in clearing of $5 million or $6 million, we expect that to be offset. So I just want to give you a little bit of color on that. 
Boy, that was a long-winded answer, wasn't it?"

But I thought that percentage -- I thought it was like -- it's running at 12% of Open Trading revenue right now, and I thought that could cut in half. And I'm just trying to understand why. It doesn't seem like we saw any impact in this quarter, and I thought we ramped -- or started to launch it in August. And where are we at as we enter the new year in regards to fully have all the capital in place, et cetera?"

And we have the costs associated with clearing, Open Trading, corporate bond transactions. And that has to do with self-clearing in the U.S., transition to the settlement agent in the U.K. And that's what we've been talking about, a reduction in those clearing costs by upwards of 1/3. 
But the second component, and this is part of why you're not seeing the reduction, the second component is clearing cost for U.S. Treasury trading, where MarketAxess intermediates those trades. In the near term, we're leaving that treasury clearing model in place. And I've talked about this in the past. Clearing cost for treasuries run somewhere around 30% of treasury revenue. It depends on the protocol, it depends on trade size during the quarter. Longer term, we'll look at rationalizing the broker-dealers and ultimately addressing the clearing model longer term. But you have to look at those 2 pieces. 
Now in the fourth quarter, and I -- admittedly, we did see some improvement in clearing cost. So for example, as a percentage of Open Trading revenue for credit. Clearing costs were a little more than 9%. They had been running the prior year with a little higher than 11% in the fourth quarter. So we did see some improvement, but we acknowledged that there were some teething pains in the fourth quarter. 
We're still -- we're looking at 2021 expenses. Third-party clearing cost expenses for credit, we believe that the savings will be upwards of 1/3 on a steady-state basis, whether you look at it as a percentage of Open Trading revenue on a per-ticket basis, on a per-million traded basis. We're still looking at about a 30% or so savings. So it doesn't come through clearly in the numbers, but some of it has to do with, again, with -- we have 2 elements to our clearing costs, both corporate bonds and then on the treasury side."

So that's new as part of our offering. 
We also plan to launch RFQ in the first half of this year. So we'd have a combined Click-To-Trade. So for your more liquid front end of the curve would be Click-To-Trade solutions, and then you'd be able to RFQ across the curve for larger trade size or less liquid products. And that right now is being communicated to our clients, and the demand is quite high, particularly around the events of last year and the liquidity constraints that were on some of the other platforms offering rates trading. So there's some excitement from our clients on providing not only a full breadth of product with unique off-the-run Click-To-Trade solutions, but also having a unique liquidity on the platform similar to how we run our credit trading solutions."

And we're excited about the progress that we made in the municipal bond market during the course of 2020, and all signs are that we can add a lot of value there in terms of transaction cost savings and efficiency in the years ahead.
And you're right, the institutional market really hasn't been electronic historically. So there's a lot of market share available there that is still done either through instant messaging or through phone conversations that we think will benefit from our platform. And as you know, the muni market is the most fragmented bond market in the world. So Open Trading adds a tremendous amount of value where we can connect all market participants into our all-to-all liquidity pool and add value in terms of connecting people and finding the other side of the trade. 
EM is much the same. It's been an important growth area for us for many years, but we're more excited about what's still ahead. And when you're here at MarketAxess, you don't really think all that much about the part of the market that's already electronic. You think about the 75% of global credit that's not yet electronic. And global EM is a great example of that where we are connecting not only hard currency debt in EM, but 26 local markets all in one marketplace, with a combination of dealer liquidity and alternative liquidity through all-to-all or Open Trading. 
So we think we've got a tremendous opportunity there. We're excited about the signs we see at beginning of electronic trading adoption in important areas like Asia. We are seeing really good client take-up going on there, and that will be an important part of our global EM strategy. But this is why we're investing the way that we are, as Tony talked about earlier, is the future opportunity is just so large. And munis and global EM are just 2 of many examples that we're looking at right now.
And just to put it in context of the whole market, if you look at the full year 2020, the top 5 banks alone had global FICC revenue of $68 billion. MarketAxess had a record year of about $690 million or 1% of that revenue pie. So we see tremendous opportunity ahead as the market continues to adopt to the structural changes that are taking place, new forms of liquidity, the growth in ETF assets, the growth in portfolio trading. We're really excited about what we see as the change in the market taking place that will undoubtedly increase market turnover and velocity. And that's what really fuels our interest in continuing to invest in this business."

I think when we've talked about the liquidity characteristics of that high-yield market versus high-grade in the past, there was an agreement that the eventual electronic penetration rate in the high-yield market will be lower than the high-grade market. Just curious to hear updated thoughts there and if they changed at all, just given that we've just seen tremendous growth in high-yield, electronic trading last year. Just wondering if there's something different about the ETF market or the hedge fund adoption or growth there that's changed your long-term view on kind of the high-yield eventual electronic penetration rates."

Thanks for that, Kyle. And you're right. This is undoubtedly the best year-over-year market share growth story we've ever had at MarketAxess, seeing the inflection point in high-yield during the course of 2020.
But I'd point to a number of things. It's the size of our open order trading -- Open Trading order book now is so significant that it's drawing new interest into our platform for high-yield trading. And the results are very good in terms of the quality of execution and the transaction cost savings that we can deliver. So that creates this virtuous cycle where investors are more inclined to continue to put more orders into the system because of the transaction cost savings that they are achieving.
I'd also say this is a market which is a great example of the changes taking place in fixed income because we have very active alternative market makers that are now committing new capital to the high-yield market. This is their primary way of transacting with end institutional clients is through the MarketAxess system. 
The hedge funds are getting much more involved in our high-yield platform and finding great trading opportunities. And then there's significant growth going on in systematic credit trading strategies. And we see a lot of activity in rebalancing from systematic strategies coming into the high-yield platform. So it's really a combination of factors. And yes, I do -- we all have higher thoughts now about where that electronic share will go.
The other thing that's been really interesting to observe over the last 3 or 4 quarters is that a year ago, the bulk of our activity in high-yield was really in $1 million and under trade sizes. We're now doing significantly better in round lot high-yield trading, which is a terrific sign that the market is getting much more comfortable putting larger trade sizes through on the high-yield system. So we're really pleased with the results, but we think there's a long way to go. We're 17% of the market in the fourth quarter and the other 83% is mostly conducted through traditional means. So there's a lot of runway left in the high-yield market, and we're excited about what we see."

And I mentioned them briefly earlier. But the growth in ETF, funds under management is driving a lot of activity in the underlying bonds. It's creating a lot of relative value trading activity between the ETF shares and the underlying bond market. Portfolio trading is really driving a lot of activity into our system on managing the tail risk in block bulk transactions that take place. And you're seeing this huge growth in both buy side and sell side, new entrants and new participants in global credit markets. 
So it leaves me feeling like we are going to see 5 years of very healthy growth in market share and a significant portion of global credit over the next 5 to 10 years is likely to be electronic. And this is why we have no hesitation about investing heavily in the business. Because the majority of the business today is still conducted through traditional means. And I think the direction of travel is very clear that electronic trading percentage of the market will continue to grow because of the transaction cost benefits that we are delivering and the efficiency it brings to all market participants and the fact that it does allow everybody to participate on a level playing field. So we see many good years ahead in terms of market share gains."

When you look at electronic market share growth in the global credit market, it should experience similar characteristics to other markets where you also see combined with that electronic growth and market share turnover growth. We've witnessed that in 2020, and we expect that to continue. So as the electronic piece of the market grows and, certainly, people in the industry forecast it can be as high as 90% of the overall market, you will likely see higher turnover rates across the global corporate bond market as well. 
And we're seeing elements of that happening where certain hedge funds -- systematic hedge funds are entering the market using our platform. And we've seen those entries in other asset classes where turnover does increase. So you can't just look at it as a single number, what is electronic market share of the overall market.

It's just our dealer RFQ initiative that we really were pushing throughout 2020 has seen exceptional growth where dealers are coming to us for liquidation of positions. 
And largely, those liquidations are as a result of a larger block trade that was done. And they have either pieces of that trade that they're unloading or other pieces of a portfolio that they are liquidating. So our -- really, our dealer RFQ growth rate -- and in Q4, in high-yield alone, our dealer RFQ offering doubled in volume. And overall, dealer RFQ was up substantially throughout 2020. So I think that's an area of evidence where we may not be capturing the original block, but we're seeing the benefits of the liquidation of block pieces."

I think I said a year ago that I loved munis. And if you look at our performance in munis in 2020, we're more excited about the opportunity in 2021 given our growth rate. We had a record day for munis in January, just recently. So continued excitement around that.
Our plan for automation is quite sophisticated in how we're starting to combine Auto-X and Auto-Responder together to create what are the early days of the traditional algorithm for clients to help clients take a large block order, be passive throughout the period of the day, have a timed auto-execution later in the day, so they can still see the success of the position getting executed, but they can improve their execution quality throughout the day. Features where we're providing own methods with trades, partial trades on a larger-size order is all being rolled out in 2021. So just a great deal of activity in the automation area across all of our products.

But I think what you're referring to is the very robust and record levels of new issuance last year and how that impacts new issue activity this year. And you're right, it would be unreasonable to expect that new issue volume and activity this year will mimic last year. However, when we look at the dealer estimates, it's still expected to be an active year on any normal basis. It was just last year, it was extraordinary because of the needs for so many corporations to bolster liquidity on their balance sheet during the pandemic. 
So we are -- we would temper our views on new issue secondary trading activity this year relative to last. But we still think the long-term macro trend is toward more market turnover and higher velocity. And the greater electronification of credit markets is one piece of that. And as I mentioned, the new tools around portfolio and ETF to transfer risk are part of that story. And then the massive increase in credit market participants is part of that story. So we still think, in the short term, yes, we might have a minor headwind from slightly less newly issued bond trading. But in the long term, we're really bullish on overall market volume and market turnover.
We have new protocols, Live Markets, Mid-X, others that are really designed around actively traded bonds, including newly issued bonds. So we think we have a role to play in that market after the bonds break into the secondary market, and we'll continue to push ahead on that as well."

In terms of a little bit of guidance for 2021, we've got a pretty decent pipeline as we enter 2021. We think we can deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. And we had new data sales last year of about $6.5 million. It was about $5.5 million the year before that. We've got a pretty good pipeline entering 2021. But I just would reiterate what we've said in the past around data that we're also using data to incent clients to trade more on the platform. And that's a principal use of the content that we're capturing. So we expect to grow the info services revenue double digits. But again, it is an important piece of the information we're delivering to help clients make pricing decisions.
On the post-trade side, take it in 2 pieces on the post-trade side. And we have given some color on regulatory reporting hub what the impact would be. We gave some color in the third quarter. Take that piece, it's somewhere around $1 million per month in revenue is what we're expecting, maybe a little bit higher than that what we're expecting in 2021. On the organic side, we're expecting double-digit growth on the organic side, and it's really a full year impact of SFTR reporting, which came online midway through 2020.
And it's also -- we've been adding clients organically. So the combination of those 2 items, we think we're looking at double-digit organic growth, overlay regulatory reporting hub, $1 million or so in revenue a month. And that gives you a sense for what we're expecting for 2021."

I appreciate the question on the green bond initiative because it's something we work closely on all year. Obviously, the goal of the green bond initiative was certainly to provide our clients with a better solution as they went out to look for filling some of their ESG mandates that they were getting from their own clients. We certainly made green bonds much more available on the platform.
The nice thing about the solution is we were planting trees for every $1 million of green bonds that you traded on the platform. So the economic incentives are there, but also the benefits for the environment are there as well and planting over 135,000 trees as a result of those green bonds traded on platform. 
Green bonds and really ESG-related bonds saw a record issuance in 2020. The forecast for 2021 are even larger. So we expect ESG-related bonds to make up a much larger portion of the new issue market in 2021. And we will continue to run our green bond trading for tree solution. Clients are getting -- will be getting certificates for the trees that they planted. We're also excited to pick the #1 trading for trees trader on the planet, so they'll get an award as we roll out some of the awards for the environmental efforts that our clients participated in. 
There's another initiative that's related that I think is worth mentioning because it cuts across many of our products. And that's our diversity dealer solution that we rolled out in the fourth quarter. It's quite exciting because it really solves some of the similar mandates that our clients have around ESG. And this allows diversity dealers to take advantage of our all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading, and attach themselves to that market and participate in trades where they can also save our clients -- better execution quality and save them money on their actual execution. 
So our clients are seeing the ability to select a diversity dealer at the same time as achieve best execution in their execution. So I expect the diversity dealer solution and our green bond solution to be quite exciting solutions as we look into 2021 and all the ESG-related mandates that are coming down from investors across the globe."

First quarter revenue reached a new quarterly record of $195 million, up 16%; operating income of $103 million, was up 14%; and EPS of $2.11, was up 8%. Record revenue was driven primarily by market share gains in our core credit products. New quarterly volume records were set for total credit trading volume as well as new volume records for high-yield trading, emerging markets, eurobonds and municipal bonds.
Open trading volumes grew 20% year-over-year, and estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients were $197 million. International client volume was up 18% and reached a new record of $237 million. It is important to remember that in Q1 last year, we had 5 full weeks of elevated credit market activity due to the onset of the pandemic. In light of the significant difference in market conditions this year, we feel very good about the volume, revenue and earnings growth this quarter.
Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. The top left chart displays just how different the market environment was 1 year ago. Our business thrives when credit spread volatility increases. During Q1 last year, credit spread volatility was 10x greater than this year, and credit spreads in high-grade were nearly 200 basis points wider.
New issue activity was strong during the quarter and similar to last year. TRACE volumes in high-grade were up 7% in Q1, reflecting a continuing trend toward higher secondary market turnover. Average years to maturity for investment-grade bonds traded on the system continues to climb and reach the high end of the historical range at 10 years this quarter.
Slide 5 provides an update on open trading. Our market-leading all-to-all marketplace, open trading set new records this quarter with an average of 34,000 orders per day, totaling over $19 billion in notional value per day in credit products. High grade, high-yield and emerging markets all show healthy open trading volume increases in excess of 20%. Dealer initiated open-trading orders were up 78% year-over-year. Our D2D business now represents 8% of our credit trading volume and 7% of credit trading revenue as we compete effectively in this client segment with more traditional D2D competitors through open trading.
This quarter, 2/3 of our system-wide open orders traded with a traditional dealer counterparty, while 1/3 found price improvement in open trading. Open trading ADV reached a new record of $4 billion per day, up 22% year-over-year. For the fifth quarter in a row, estimated transaction cost savings of $197 million delivered to our clients were in excess of total company credit trading revenue.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on product and client expansion."

Throughout the past year, we have remained focused on bolstering our global footprint and expanding our product offerings. I will touch on a few of these initiatives today. Our international growth continues with an 18% year-over-year increase in international client volumes, driven by over 900 active clients across our global products. In the first quarter, U.S. credit volume from international clients was up 23%. Emerging markets volume increased by 22% and eurobond volumes increased by 13%. Our ongoing investment in Asia Pacific region delivered an increase in the number of clients and significant gains in volume. Client credit volume from the region grew to $29 billion, up 57% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of clients in the region also grew by 14% over the past year. We are encouraged by the progress we are making outside the U.S., and we believe we are well positioned to capture a larger share of trading in the growing global credit markets.
In the area of product expansion, we continue to see momentum in our municipal bond offering. In the first quarter, we again hit record volumes with a total of $5.8 billion in municipal bond volumes, up 75% from a year ago. We also recently closed on the acquisition of MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue serving large banks and inter-dealer brokers in the municipal bond market. The acquisition expands our connectivity with dealers and provides rich content for our growing Muni client business.
Our post-trade business, an important contributor to our data strategy, continues to grow with organic post-trade revenue up 50% in the first quarter, driven largely by new client additions and our SFTR offering. We now have over 950 unique post-trade clients. The integration of our recently acquired regulatory reporting hub is well underway and is extending our leading regulatory reporting business across Europe, while further strengthening our data capabilities and our post-trade services.
Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation in credit trading. Automated trading and dealers automated responses continue to grow across the platform. Automated trading volumes rose to $39 billion in the first quarter, up from $31 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Auto-X trade count also grew in the quarter to 205,000, up 37% from the prior year. 95 firms utilized our Auto-X functionality in the quarter, up from 84 in Q1 of last year, while 22 firms used our auto responder functionality. We are also seeing healthy adoption of Auto-X across investment grade, eurobonds, high-yield and emerging markets.
The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.8 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 57% from the same period last year. The growth in the average number of responses per inquiry has resumed following a decline in the first half of last year. The increasing responses ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform.
As the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit, we are seeing continued demand for and growth in our automated trading solutions. We are continuing to develop innovative automated trading solutions in collaboration with our buy and sell-side clients, and I look forward to sharing updates to our offering in the coming quarters. 
Slide 8 provides a summary of our trade environment across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 10% year-over-year to $363 billion for the quarter, largely due to an increase in market volumes and market share gains. Estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 7%, while estimated share increased -- market share increased by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year to 20.5%. Volumes in our other credit category were up 19% year-over-year to $391 billion for the quarter, and we achieved record quarterly trading volume in high yield, emerging markets, eurobonds and municipal bonds.
Market share gains account for the vast majority of the increase across each product category, with U.S. high-yield volume up 21%, emerging markets volume up 18%, eurobond volume up 15% and municipal bonds up 75%. 
Our rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2020, and we are beginning to see volume contribution from both our new dealer-to-client trading protocol and our recently launched hedging initiatives. Over 150 clients are now approved for our Click-To-Trade rates offering. Regarding April activity, with 7 full days of trading left in April, it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the full month. However, trace market volumes are currently running below Q1 levels, and our market share is maintaining levels similar to Q1.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."
109450,710504451,2255340,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","MarketAxess Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year.

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume led to a 13% uplift in commissions. Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $10.3 million and includes $4 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the regulatory reporting hub acquisition.
Operating income was up 14% year-over-year, and operating margin was 53% in the first quarter. EBITDA hit a record quarterly level in the quarter. Other expense was $1.6 million in the first quarter and includes foreign currency transaction losses of $500,000.
Absent unpredictable items like foreign currency transaction and investment gains and losses, we would expect other expense to run around $1 million per quarter. The effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter and reflects $4 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Inclusive of the recently enacted increase in the New York state corporate tax rate, we are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 24%. 
On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 15% year-over-year. On a composite basis, the majority of the 17% increase in credit transaction fees was driven by estimated market share gains. The decline in rates transaction fees was due to lower U.S. treasury's trading volume, principally resulting from a decline in estimated dealer-to-dealer market volumes. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $7 versus the fourth quarter level, but $4 higher year-over-year. There were several factors contributing to the sequential decline in fee capture, including a shift in trade size.
The duration impact on U.S. high-grade fee capture was muted on a sequential quarterly basis as longer years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform was offset by higher bond yields. Our other credit category fee per million of $202 was similar to both the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2020 levels. Product mix, along with fee capture at the individual product level, was very consistent across these periods. 
Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. First quarter expenses were up 18% year-over-year and include $3.6 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs related to the regulatory reporting hub business. Excluding the regulatory reporting hub activity, expenses were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant currency basis. The rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 74 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles.
While open trading volume increased 20%, overall clearing costs were down 15%. In March, we completed the second phase of our settlement project with the transition to a new settlement agent in the U.K. Although we expect to realize some further cost improvements over the balance of this year, I'm happy to report that third-party clearing costs measured on a per ticket basis declined by over 35% year-over-year.
As Chris mentioned, we closed on the MuniBrokers acquisition on April 9. We expect MuniBrokers expenses will be around $4 million in 2021, 50% of which will be amortization of acquired intangibles. We are updating our full year expense guidance range to $370 million to $386 million to incorporate the MuniBrokers expense activity.
On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments were $415 million at March 31, and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $340 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $50 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $25 million. We also repurchased 54,000 shares during the quarter, the majority of which were associated with the investing of employee stock awards. We didn't borrow against the revolving credit facility in the first quarter and ended the period with over $300 million of excess net capital resident at MarketAxess Corp, our regulated self-clearing entity. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend.
Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

And we're really talking about investment-grade here. And years to maturity matters. Yields matter. We have a tiered fee plan. So trade size matters. We have the mix of dealers that are participating. So for example, dealers that are on a distribution fee plan versus dealers that are on an all variable plan, the fee capture looks different. Even when it comes to protocol, it may look different. Open trading, fee capture is slightly different than disclosed request for quote. Some of the newer protocols, the fee capture is different. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But Rich, you're right. Looking at, say, Q4 versus Q1, that's probably the best way to describe it. And when you look at those 2 periods, fee capture was down about $7 per million. A couple of items in there. Trade size was one of them. Not a big influencer, but trade size did tend to shift to a little bit larger trade size as our fee capture is a little bit lower. Dealer mix. So when we look at dealers that are on all variable plans versus fixed plans, a little bit heavier weighting to dealers on fixed plans, fee capture a little bit lower. But the item you mentioned, which is very interesting, as Rick picked it up on in his comments, we're at close to the post credit crisis high on years to maturity of bonds traded over the platform. Typically, that would result in higher fee capture, dollar value of the basis points higher with longer years to maturity. But in this case, what offset the years to maturity was the fact that yields were up. So again, you're right, you look at fourth quarter to first quarter, you did see a rise in bond yields. So those 2 were largely offsetting. One last thing because I'm getting -- I'm on the clock right now. One last thing, just sensitivity going forward, every year to maturity is around $10 to $15 per million, all things being equal. A 1% change in yields across the yield curve, again, about a $10 to $15 per million, all else being equal."

But yes, you did see growth again in the first quarter in portfolio trading. And I think that situationally, clients and dealers are finding good opportunities to use the workflow solutions around portfolio trading for efficiency and execution. And there are a variety of different cases where dealers can promote inventory in baskets to clients, which, in an environment like this, has been very popular from both sides. You have certain transactions that involves offsetting buys and sells where the combined risk of the basket is less than it would be in individual bonds and can sometimes create efficient execution for both sides. You've also seen trades where investors are making room for new issues through portfolio trading. So a variety of different case studies. And March was an unusually active month for portfolio trading. It's tapered off from what we can see on the Trace tape in April so far, but very large month in March. PAUSE We continue to work on our workflow solution there. We are very confident that we are closing the gaps that we have, and we'll be competitive in this space. At the same time, we're making very large investments in our liquidity solutions through open trading and in new product areas. So it's a convenient workflow solution.

But listen, when we look at broadly at market share trends, we're really encouraged by what we see in the first quarter, even though, as you point out, market volatility across most credit products was significantly lower than it had been for much of last year. It's coming through most clearly in year-over-year gains in high-yield and emerging markets. High grade, a little bit more developed market electronically is going to have ebbs and flows based on volatility. And especially with the ETFR community, where you would have seen them very active a year ago at high volatility levels, and they are always less active in low volatility environments. But beyond that, when we look under the hood at the trends that we see with investment managers, hedge funds, dealers using open trading, international clients, it's all very encouraging for long-term market share gains. And we have no control over the quarter-to-quarter market conditions. But if you look historically at our consistent growth and success over almost 17 years of being a public company, we've been able to show sustainable long-term growth through any environment. So our expectation is that we have lots of reason for optimism because of the liquidity solutions that we are delivering and the significant transaction cost savings to see share gains through any environment, and that is certainly what we saw in the first quarter of this year."

I was hoping to dig into that a little bit more. Can you provide us, I guess, maybe some specifics around what MarketAxess is doing in order to enable greater pace of electronification in the Muni market today? What are some of the biggest hurdles? Obviously, it feels like there's a lot of inertia in that space. I'm trying to think how you guys are trying to break through that? And how much of the Muni market do you think could ultimately become electronically traded?"

You're talking about a very large market, a difficult market to trade because of the breadth of product in that market. Data analytics will prove to be very helpful in the Muni market as we break down the more manual parts of the market and add electronic trading. I'm encouraged by our growth in Muni's. Obviously, the 75% year-over-year increase in that market is encouraging. Also, I'm encouraged by the size of our all-to-all market in Muni's. So all-to-all is proving to be a very important component to our growth rate. It's now 43% of our volume in Muni's. The other areas that -- we're seeing areas like dealer RFQ in Muni's grow over 170% year-over-year. So we are seeing dealers using our platform similar to the way they would use an inter dealer market -- inter dealer broker market. We obviously have closed the acquisition of MuniBrokers. That's approximately 4% of the Muni market, heavily weighted towards exempt Muni's. So we're working on the integration of that market, and we plan to have that integrated more largely in 2021. I do think, as you think about that market, there's sizable costs to large investors to maintain their large -- small trade size across the Muni market. And we're seeing investments from the large investment managers to reduce their costs in that market, similar to the way they've embraced electronic trading across their investment-grade and high-yield trading guests. So we just see that trend continuing. We see getting higher penetration rates in those large client flows in the Muni market. I can't predict how far it goes. But given the small ticket sizes, the complexity of the market, I would expect high dependency on electronic solutions for the years to come."

So we've moved our market share up primarily by investors and dealers in high yield, getting more comfortable with large trade sizes. In high grade, we've been pretty flat around the 10% area lately. Clearly, live markets is intended to attack part of the block trading market in very liquid bonds, where both new issues and benchmark deals trade actively in block size and very tight bid offer.

But our business keeps getting more diversified, right? So our European business is more important than ever. We talked about Asia. Global EM is loaded with opportunities. All of them have different cycles and volatility characteristics along the way that it's not something that we worry that much about. We would not have encouraged anybody last spring to use those volatility levels is the new normal, and we would not encourage you today to leave -- to use current levels as the new normal either. And what we do is focus on the long-term is -- and that's where we've had great success is investing in important trading protocols and new markets around the world and new clients onboarding, and there's a lot of that going on right now.

So important fundamental growth rates are happening even in the face of macro wins. With regard to green bonds, we're doing a lot of exciting things in the whole ESG area. I'll note that our ESG report is now live, up on our website. So please take a look. There's been a lot of work into that report. And it reflects all the different things we're doing as a company, but also some of the things that we're doing for our client investors who trade green bonds. First quarter green bond volume was $13 billion. So we continue to see increases on our platform in green bonds. More importantly, we launched last year, the green bond -- the Trading for Trees initiative. So not only are we benefiting from the growth of green bonds trading on our platform, but we're taking a stand in the environment and planting trees. We planted 65,000 trees in the first quarter. That's on top of what we planned in 2020, which was 130,000 trees. So we continue to see our progress there -- and we have a small fire alarm test going on in our background, so please ignore that.

First quarter revenue reached a new quarterly record of $195 million, up 16%; operating income of $103 million, was up 14%; and EPS of $2.11, was up 8%. Record revenue was driven primarily by market share gains in our core credit products. New quarterly volume records were set for total credit trading volume as well as new volume records for high-yield trading, emerging markets, eurobonds and municipal bonds.
Open trading volumes grew 20% year-over-year, and estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients were $197 million. International client volume was up 18% and reached a new record of $237 billion. It is important to remember that in Q1 last year, we had 5 full weeks of elevated credit market activity due to the onset of the pandemic. In light of the significant difference in market conditions this year, we feel very good about the volume, revenue and earnings growth this quarter.
Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. The top left chart displays just how different the market environment was 1 year ago. Our business thrives when credit spread volatility increases. During Q1 last year, credit spread volatility was 10x greater than this year, and credit spreads in high-grade were nearly 200 basis points wider.
New issue activity was strong during the quarter and similar to last year. TRACE volumes in high-grade were up 7% in Q1, reflecting a continuing trend toward higher secondary market turnover. Average years to maturity for investment-grade bonds traded on the system continues to climb and reach the high end of the historical range at 10 years this quarter.
Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Our market-leading all-to-all marketplace, Open Trading set new records this quarter with an average of 34,000 orders per day, totaling over $19 billion in notional value per day in credit products. High grade, high-yield and emerging markets all show healthy open trading volume increases in excess of 20%. Dealer initiated open-trading orders were up 78% year-over-year. Our D2D business now represents 8% of our credit trading volume and 7% of credit trading revenue as we compete effectively in this client segment with more traditional D2D competitors through open trading.
This quarter, 2/3 of our system-wide open orders traded with a traditional dealer counterparty, while 1/3 found price improvement in Open Trading. Open Trading ADV reached a new record of $4 billion per day, up 22% year-over-year. For the fifth quarter in a row, estimated transaction cost savings of $197 million delivered to our clients were in excess of total company credit trading revenue.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on product and client expansion."

Throughout the past year, we have remained focused on bolstering our global footprint and expanding our product offerings. I will touch on a few of these initiatives today. Our international growth continues with an 18% year-over-year increase in international client volumes, driven by over 900 active clients across our global products. In the first quarter, U.S. credit volume from international clients was up 23%. Emerging markets volume increased by 22% and eurobond volumes increased by 13%. Our ongoing investment in Asia Pacific region delivered an increase in the number of clients and significant gains in volume. Client credit volume from the region grew to $29 billion, up 57% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of clients in the region also grew by 14% over the past year. We are encouraged by the progress we are making outside the U.S., and we believe we are well positioned to capture a larger share of trading in the growing global credit markets.
In the area of product expansion, we continue to see momentum in our municipal bond offering. In the first quarter, we again hit record volumes with a total of $5.8 billion in municipal bond volumes, up 75% from a year ago. We also released -- recently closed on the acquisition of MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue serving large banks and inter-dealer brokers in the municipal bond market. The acquisition expands our connectivity with dealers and provides rich content for our growing Muni client business.
Our post-trade business, an important contributor to our data strategy, continues to grow with organic post-trade revenue up 50% in the first quarter, driven largely by new client additions and our SFTR offering. We now have over 950 unique post-trade clients. The integration of our recently acquired Regulatory Reporting Hub is well underway and is extending our leading regulatory reporting business across Europe, while further strengthening our data capabilities and our post-trade services.
Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation in Credit Trading. Automated trading and dealers automated responses continue to grow across the platform. Automated trading volumes rose to $39 billion in the first quarter, up from $31 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Auto-X trade count also grew in the quarter to 205,000, up 37% from the prior year. 95 firms utilized our Auto-X functionality in the quarter, up from 84 in Q1 of last year, while 22 firms used our Auto-Responder functionality. We are also seeing healthy adoption of Auto-X across investment grade, eurobonds, high-yield and emerging markets.
The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.8 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 57% from the same period last year. The growth in the average number of responses per inquiry has resumed following a decline in the first half of last year. The increasing responses ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform.
As the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit, we are seeing continued demand for and growth in our automated trading solutions. We are continuing to develop innovative automated trading solutions in collaboration with our buy and sell-side clients, and I look forward to sharing updates to our offering in the coming quarters. 
Slide 8 provides a summary of our trade environment across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were up 10% year-over-year to $363 billion for the quarter, largely due to an increase in market volumes and market share gains. Estimated U.S. high-grade market volumes were up 7%, while estimated share increased -- market share increased by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year to 20.5%. Volumes in our other credit category were up 19% year-over-year to $391 billion for the quarter, and we achieved record quarterly trading volume in high yield, emerging markets, eurobonds and municipal bonds.
Market share gains account for the vast majority of the increase across each product category, with U.S. high-yield volume up 21%, emerging markets volume up 18%, eurobond volume up 15% and municipal bonds up 75%. 
Our rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2020, and we are beginning to see volume contribution from both our new dealer-to-client trading protocol and our recently launched hedging initiatives. Over 150 clients are now approved for our Click-To-Trade rates offering. Regarding April activity, with 7 full days of trading left in April, it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the full month. However, TRACE market volumes are currently running below Q1 levels, and our market share is maintaining levels similar to Q1.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."
109450,710504451,2255771,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","MarketAxess Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume led to a 13% uplift in commissions. Post-trade services revenue m",733,"Thank you, Chris. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume led to a 13% uplift in commissions. Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $10.3 million and includes $4 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition.
Operating income was up 14% year-over-year, and operating margin was 53% in the first quarter. EBITDA hit a record quarterly level in the quarter. Other expense was $1.6 million in the first quarter and includes foreign currency transaction losses of $500,000. Absent unpredictable items like foreign currency transaction and investment gains and losses, we would expect other expense to run around $1 million per quarter. The effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter and reflects $4 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Inclusive of the recently enacted increase in the New York state corporate tax rate, we are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 24%. 
On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 15% year-over-year. On a composite basis, the majority of the 17% increase in credit transaction fees was driven by estimated market share gains. The decline in rates transaction fees was due to lower U.S. treasury's trading volume, principally resulting from a decline in estimated dealer-to-dealer market volumes. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down $7 versus the fourth quarter level, but $4 higher year-over-year. There were several factors contributing to the sequential decline in fee capture, including a shift in trade size.
The duration impact on U.S. high-grade fee capture was muted on a sequential quarterly basis as longer years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform was offset by higher bond yields. Our other credit category fee per million of $202 was similar to both the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2020 levels. Product mix, along with fee capture at the individual product level, was very consistent across these periods. 
Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. First quarter expenses were up 18% year-over-year and include $3.6 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub business. Excluding the regulatory Reporting Hub activity, expenses were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant currency basis. The rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 74 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors, including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles.
While Open Trading volume increased 20%, overall clearing costs were down 15%. In March, we completed the second phase of our settlement project with the transition to a new settlement agent in the U.K. Although we expect to realize some further cost improvements over the balance of this year, I'm happy to report that third-party clearing costs measured on a per ticket basis declined by over 35% year-over-year.
As Chris mentioned, we closed on the MuniBrokers acquisition on April 9. We expect MuniBrokers expenses will be around $4 million in 2021, 50% of which will be amortization of acquired intangibles. We are updating our full year expense guidance range to $370 million to $386 million to incorporate the MuniBrokers expense activity.
On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments were $415 million at March 31, and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $340 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $50 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $25 million. We also repurchased 54,000 shares during the quarter, the majority of which were associated with the investing of employee stock awards. We didn't borrow against the revolving credit facility in the first quarter and ended the period with over $300 million of excess net capital resident at MarketAxess Corp, our regulated self-clearing entity. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend.
Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

And we're really talking about investment-grade here. And years to maturity matters, yields matter. We have a tiered fee plan. So trade size matters. We have the mix of dealers that are participating. So for example, dealers that are on a distribution fee plan versus dealers that are on an all variable plan, the fee capture looks different. Even when it comes to protocol, it may look different. Open Trading, fee capture is slightly different than disclosed request for quote. Some of the newer protocols of fee capture is different. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But Rich, you're right. Looking at, say, Q4 versus Q1, that's probably the best way to describe it. And when you look at those 2 periods, fee capture was down about $7 per million. A couple of items in there. Trade size was one of them. Not a big influencer, but trade size did tend to shift to a little bit larger trade size as our fee capture is a little bit lower. 
Dealer mix. So when we look at dealers that are on all variable plans versus fixed plans, a little bit heavier weighting to dealers on fixed plans, fee capture a little bit lower. But the item you mentioned, which is very interesting, as Rick picked it up on in his comments, we're at -- close to the post credit crisis high on years to maturity of bonds traded over the platform. Typically, that would result in higher fee capture, dollar value of the basis points higher with longer years to maturity. But in this case, what offset the years to maturity was the fact that yields were up. So again, you're right, you look at fourth quarter to first quarter, you did see a rise in bond yields. So those 2 were largely offsetting. One last thing because I'm getting -- I'm on the clock right now. One last thing, just sensitivity going forward, every year to maturity is around $10 to $15 per million, all things being equal. A 1% change in yields across the yield curve, again, about a $10 to $15 per million, all things -- all else being equal."

But yes, you did see growth again in the first quarter in portfolio trading. And I think that situationally, clients and dealers are finding good opportunities to use the workflow solutions around portfolio trading for efficiency and execution. And there are a variety of different cases where dealers can promote inventory in baskets to clients, which, in an environment like this, has been very popular from both sides. You have certain transactions that involves offsetting buys and sells where the combined risk of the basket is less than it would be in individual bonds and can sometimes create efficient execution for both sides. You've also seen trades where investors are making room for new issues through portfolio trading. So a variety of different case studies. And March was an unusually active month for portfolio trading. It's tapered off from what we can see on the TRACE tape in April so far, but very large month in March. We continue to work on our workflow solution there. We are very confident that we are closing the gaps that we have, and we'll be competitive in this space. At the same time, we're making very large investments in our liquidity solutions through open trading and in new product areas. So it's a convenient workflow solution. It's -- they're a subset of very large dealers that are active, a subset of very large clients, limited client community, but growing importance in the market, and it's something that we expect to be competitive in throughout '21 and beyond."

But listen, when we look at broadly at market share trends, we're really encouraged by what we see in the first quarter, even though, as you've point out, market volatility across most credit products was significantly lower than it had been much -- for much of last year. It's coming through most clearly in year-over-year gains in high-yield and emerging markets. High grade, a little bit more developed market electronically is going to have ebbs and flows based on volatility. And especially with the ETFR community, where you would have seen them very active a year ago at high volatility levels, and they are always less active in low volatility environments. But beyond that, when we look under the hood at the trends that we see with investment managers, hedge funds, dealers using Open Trading, international clients, it's all very encouraging for long-term market share gains. And we have no control over the quarter-to-quarter market conditions. But if you look historically at our consistent growth and success over almost 17 years of being a public company, we've been able to show sustainable long-term growth through any environment. So our expectation is that we have lots of reason for optimism because of the liquidity solutions that we are delivering and the significant transaction cost savings to see share gains through any environment, and that is certainly what we saw in the first quarter of this year."

With respect to China, I think that it's very clear that they will continue to take additional steps to open up their fixed income markets. And given the presence we have with global investors in our EM franchise, we know that we can play a significant role in bringing investor order flow into China. And we're also encouraged by southbound traffic, where it's likely that investors within China will be trading more actively outside of China. So we would expect to be more involved in that market.

You're talking about a very large market, a difficult market to trade because of the breadth of product in that market. Data analytics will prove to be very helpful in the muni market as we break down the more manual parts of the market and add electronic trading. I'm encouraged by our growth in muni's. Obviously, the 75% year-over-year increase in that market is encouraging. Also, I'm encouraged by the size of our all-to-all market in muni's. So all-to-all is proving to be a very important component to our growth rate. It's now 43% of our volume in munis. The other areas that -- we're seeing areas like dealer RFQ in munis grow over 170% year-over-year. So we are seeing dealers using our platform similar to the way they would use an inter-dealer market -- inter dealer broker market. We obviously have closed the acquisition of MuniBrokers that's approximately 4% of the muni market, heavily weighted towards exempt Munis. So we're working on the integration of that market, and we plan to have that integrated more largely in 2021. 
I do think, as you think about that market, there's sizable costs to large investors to maintain their large -- small trade size across the muni market. And we're seeing investments from the large investment managers to reduce their costs in that market, similar to the way they've embraced electronic trading across their investment-grade, high-yield trading guests. So we just see that trend continuing. We see getting higher penetration rates in those large client flows in the muni market. I can't predict how far it goes. But given the small ticket sizes, the complexity of the market, I would expect high dependency on electronic solutions for the years to come."

But listen, volatility comes and goes in every market, right? So yes, it's temporarily a headwind in credit. It's not to say that it will be that way next week or next month or next quarter. So we do have a goldilocks scenario right now where people are quite optimistic on economic growth for the quarters ahead, and that leads to better credit quality among a lot of corporate bond issuers. But our business keeps getting more diversified, right? So our European business is more important than ever. We talked about Asia, global EM is loaded with opportunities. All of them have different cycles and volatility characteristics along the way that it's not something that we worry that much about. We would not have encouraged anybody last spring to use those volatility levels as the new normal, and we would not encourage you today to leave -- to use current levels as the new normal either. 
And what we do is focus on the long-term is -- and that's where we've had great success is investing in important trading protocols and new markets around the world and new clients onboarding, and there's a lot of that going on right now. And there's a lot of reason to believe that over the coming quarters, there are multiple factors that could increase volatility.

We clearly have correlation to some of the growth around fixed income ETFs and the trading of fixed income ETFs.

One reflection of that is in investment-grade, in the first quarter, our Open Trading, which is an important component of the fixed income ETFR, grew 24% in Q1 over 2020. So important fundamental growth rates are happening even in the face of macro wins. With regard to green bonds, we're doing a lot of exciting things in the whole ESG area. I'll note that our ESG report is now live, up on our website. So please take a look. There's been a lot of work into that report. And it reflects all the different things we're doing as a company, but also some of the things that we're doing for our client investors who trade green bonds. First quarter green bond volume was $13 billion. So we continue to see increases on our platform in green bonds. More importantly, we launched last year, the green bond -- the Trading for Trees initiative. So not only are we benefiting from the growth of green bonds trading on our platform, but we're taking a stand in the environment and planting trees. We planted 65,000 trees in the first quarter. That's on top of what we planted in 2020, which was 130,000 trees. So we continue to see a progress there -- and we have a small fire alarm test going on in our background, so please ignore that. But trees are being planted, green bonds are being traded. And we're super excited about what we can do in that environment."

Quiet market conditions in global credit markets led to a soft quarter with revenue of $176 million, down 5%, operating income was $87 million and operating margin was 49%. Diluted EPS of $1.77, down 20% year-over-year. 
Year-over-year comparisons were challenging when looking at Q2 last year, when our revenue was up 47% and EPS was up 73%. However, 2-year compound annual growth rates showed strong revenue growth of 19%, and operating income growth of 20% this quarter versus the second quarter of 2019 and consistent with our long-term growth rates. Market share levels this quarter in high grade and high yield were similar to last year. FINRA has also announced that they will revise their historical TRACE market volumes on July 26 to adjust for the rapid increase in double counting for fixed income ATS volume. We will revisit our market share estimates once we see the adjustments from FINRA. We continue to add active clients to our network. And for the quarter, we set new records with 1,840 firms active globally. 
Emerging markets growth was a highlight for the quarter with volume up 11% year-over-year, while total EM market volumes were down an estimated 17%. Our estimated EM market share set new highs for the quarter. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress in municipal bond trading with record volume during the quarter. International clients represented 32% of our global volume in the second quarter, a new record for geographic client diversification. Earlier this week, we announced that Charles Lee, the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has joined the MarketAxess Board of Directors. Charles brings extensive experience in market structure, exchanges and electronic trading and will add important experience to our Board, especially in the Asia region. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions.  Subdued market conditions led to much lower credit market volumes in the second quarter. Institutional investors report lower fixed income trading activity and ETF market participants were much wider than normal, especially in high yield. For the quarter, high-grade corporate bond indices were locked in an 8 basis point trading range, following a range of 138 basis points 1 year ago. TRACE high-grade volume was down 20% and TRACE high-yield volume down 14% versus last year. Fixed income ETF share trading was down 31% in the second quarter versus last year. The lower left chart shows the normal deviations in high-grade and high-yield share gains versus a multiyear linear regression. We have been through quiet trading periods before and fully expect a mean reversion for market volatility and trading volumes. We remain optimistic that the increase in fixed income trading automation and all-to-all trading will lead to an increase in trading velocity. Treasury yields ticked up during the second quarter but have since moved lower once again. Treasury yields impact corporate bond duration and also our high-grade fee capture. 
Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Our unique Open Trading liquidity pool continues to drive important transaction cost savings to our clients in spite of the low volatility environment. Clients saved an estimated $127 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. The vast majority of investor and dealer initiated orders on MarketAxess are available in 1 single liquidity pool. On average, our network delivered 29,000 orders per day and over $15 billion in notional value into the Open Trading Central marketplace. We believe that our unique global institutional network with over 1,800 active firms in Open Trading, increases trading opportunities, reduces transaction costs and reduces market risk during high volatility periods. Our dealer-initiated Open Trading volume was up 28% year-over-year. Dealers are finding great value in both making markets and taking liquidity on the market access system. The D2D client segment is moving rapidly to embrace electronic trading solutions. We are also pleased with the early success in our diversity dealer initiative. We have now onboarded minority and women-owned dealers for the new program and diversity dealer volume with investors is up 90% year-over-year in early days. This is a great example of using Open Trading to expand important trading relationships for investors and dealers. 
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on new products and trading automation."

Slide 6 provides an update on our investment in new products and protocols. 
We recently announced enhancements to our portfolio trading solution, including integrating -- integrated net spotting and hedging capabilities supported through the MarketAxess rates platform. Since the technology release in late May, more than 95 portfolio trades have been completed on MarketAxess with 27 unique investor firms and 10 dealers. While portfolio trading makes up a small portion of the market, somewhere between 4% and 5% of TRACE, we are committed to further enhancing our portfolio trading solution. Our Mid-X sessions protocol was launched in the fall of 2020 and has seen significant adoption. $2.5 billion in eurobond volume was traded through Mid-X in the second quarter, up 79% from the prior quarter. We expect to expand Midex to U.S. credit products in the second half of this year. Shifting focus to new product areas, municipal bond trading on MarketAxess grew to a record $6.8 billion in the quarter. Also within the quarter, we announced the completed acquisition of muni brokers, which transacts approximately million in municipal bond volume per day, which is currently not included in our muni bond volume totals. Our market access rates offering is expanding beyond our initial click to trade solution with RFQ being launched this month and our all-to-all Open Trading functionality for treasuries launching later this year. 
We continue to deliver our clients with a choice of trading protocols across the full breadth of fixed income products, supported by a combination of dealer and all-to-all liquidity. Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $41.5 billion in volume and over 218,000 trades, 98 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 the year prior. Today, Auto-X represents 17% of total trade count and 6% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in the second quarter, up 30% from the same period last year. We've also seen continued adoption of our auto responder functionality. Auto-Responder allows client, firms to automatically respond with liquidity based on a set of predefined criteria. This functionality is a critical step in helping clients avoid the cost of regularly crossing the spread. Slide 8 provides a summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were down 22% year-over-year to $324 billion for the quarter, largely due to a significant decline in market volumes and benign market conditions in the second quarter. estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE market volumes were down 16% year-over-year. Volumes in our other credit category were up 5% year-over-year to 2 -- $345 billion for the quarter. Our trading volume in emerging market bonds and Eurobonds outpaced the change in estimated market volumes. Similar to U.S. high-grade, the most significant factor weighing on the decline in our U.S. high-yield trading volume was the double-digit decline in estimated market volumes. Our green bond trading initiative continues to support clients' ESG-related investment mandates. In the second quarter, over $13 billion worth of green bonds were traded on our platform, resulting in over 65,000 trees being planted. We have now planted over 131,000 trees since the beginning of the year, which nearly surpasses our 2020 full year record. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials."
109450,1673265591,2348652,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","MarketAxess Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris.

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. 
Revenue was $176 million, down 5% year-over-year. Commissions were 9% lower, resulting from the 10% decline in credit trading volume. Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $9.8 million, and reflects $3.8 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the regulatory reporting hub acquisition and healthy organic growth, driven by new clients and new services. Information services revenue was up 17% year-over-year, principally due to recurring data sales. The weaker dollar favorably impacted both post-trade and Information Services revenue each by around $600,000. Operating income was $87 million, down 16% year-over-year, and operating margin was 49.4% in the second quarter. If we excluded the impact of the acquisition-related intangible amortization expense and nonrecurring integration costs, operating margin would have been 52%. Despite weaker market volumes and difficult market conditions, we continue to add personnel and invest in organic and inorganic initiatives. The effective tax rate was 21.4% on a year-to-date basis. We expect the effective tax rate to vary quarter-to-quarter in the second half of the year and are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance of 22% to 24%. 
On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. On a composite basis,  the majority of the 13% decrease in credit transaction fees were driven by a decline in estimated market volumes. Lower rates transaction fees was due principally to a decline in estimated U.S. treasury market volumes. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down around 4% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We didn't make any fee plan changes during the quarter and the sequential decrease was due to a variety of factors, including slightly lower duration. Our other credit category fee per million of $194, was lower than both the first quarter 2021 and second quarter 2020 levels due principally to the impact of a change in product mix and shift in protocols. 
During the second quarter, there was a heavier weighting to emerging markets and Eurobond volume and a lighter weighting to high-yield volume. The increase in other credit distribution fees was principally due to the inclusion of muni broker subscription and license fees of $1.1 million. In the near term, we expect the subscription and license fees will run around $1.3 million per quarter. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Second quarter expenses were up 11% year-over-year. Excluding the $5.1 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs related to the regulatory reporting hub of MuniBrokers businesses, expenses were up 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, expenses were down 3.1%. Approximately half of the decline in compensation and benefits was due to lower variable incentive pay, which is tied directly to operating performance, and the residual was due to lower employer taxes, which are always seasonally higher in the first quarter. Pure salary expense was up almost $1 million versus the first quarter as we continue to execute against our hiring plan. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the amortization of acquired intangibles on the MuniBrokers transaction. Marketing and advertising costs can swing period-to-period and the second quarter reflects a more active level of advertising campaigns and return of some T&E expense. We're at the mid-year mark and are now expecting that full year expenses may end up at the low end of our expense guidance range of $370 million to $386 million. On Slide 12, we provide cash flow and capital management information. Cash and investments as of June 30 were $440 million, and trailing 12 months free cash flow was $320 million. 
During the second quarter, we paid out the quarterly cash dividend of $25 million and repurchased a total of 49,000 shares at a cost of $20 million through a combination of net down and option exercise and restricted stock vesting activity and our share buyback program. We didn't borrow against the $500 million syndicated revolving credit facility for the $200 million secured facility used to facilitate Open Trading settlement activity in the second quarter. 
Based on the second quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

Because at the midway mark in July, the first half has the 4th of July holiday weekend with very low volumes on the short trading day on July 2. So it's -- with 8 trading days left, we kind of think the best of the month is yet to come. But you're absolutely right. If you look at just the last 3 or 4 trading days with even some signs of volatility coming back. It has been beneficial for our business. And the place where it's most noticeable is obviously the ETF community gets engaged in our high-yield product, in particular, when there's volatility in high yield spreads, which we have seen more recently. So who knows whether they're last or not, but at least some positive signs on the volatility front."

And I do have to mention that I saw you running in SAG Harbor, and I think our volumes are growing faster than your pace, I noticed. But -- on Open Trading, as we think about Open Trading, we want Open Trading to really penetrate across all markets. We think it's a unique offering it brings alternative liquidity into those markets. It has a network effect of liquidity. It also allows clients to participate and avoid spread crossing and be liquidity providers when the moment is opportune for them. So Open Trading across all products is a key part of our strategy long term. In muni, we see Open Trading as a sizable portion of the market. Open Trading is about 45% of the volume in the muni market. So it's actually an important component to the muni market and that network effect. Obviously, the acquisition of muni brokers, we intend to populate our Open Trading content with MuniBrokers data. So the linkage with MuniBrokers will come through Open Trading as well, again, leveraging that Open Trading solution. In the rates market, it's a really unique opportunity that we see and 1 that actually the Fed sees as well and recently published a report a study on last year's challenges in the treasury market. So our strategy is to deploy our Open Trading solution in the treasury market. We plan to deliver that before year-end and have a very nice plan around not only RFQ, but Open Trading as well. And another key attribute of our Open Trading solution will be across the full breadth of treasury products, both on the run and also run which allows a unique product offering in treasuries that we don't see in the market today. So all of that's coming. And as I mentioned, Open Trading in things like Eurobonds, EM continues to see sizable growth even in a more challenging quarter than we just witnessed."

As a r",504,"Yes. Happy to take that one, Patrick. And I do think that different protocols work best in different environments, and you saw us try during the high volatility period a year ago when price dispersion in credit was much higher than it is currently. As a result, the additive liquidity of Open Trading and the price improvement from Open Trading was very significant to market participants and drove volumes and share through our platform. In an environment like this, where there is very limited volatility, there's less price dispersion. What we're hearing from institutional investors right now is there's actually a shortage of bonds because there's so much liquidity in the system. And as low as our rates are even lower elsewhere in the world. So asset managers are getting inflows and that increases the focus on the new issue calendar and drive some business back at the margin to dealers. The other point that I made earlier, Patrick, that you're well aware of is we have introduced a lot of new market participants to credit trading through open trading the ETF community is very active when vol is high and much less active with all at low levels as they have been recently. And when you look at our high-yield share difference, it's almost entirely driven by the swing in ETF market participants, not because they've gone anywhere else, or they don't want to trade. It's just that the arbitrage opportunity has been much less. And as a result, their levels and their share of TRACE are down significantly. And I do continue to believe, as Chris mentioned, that our Open Trading solution is differentiated. It will do well when volatility is high. A lot of the success that you see away from us is really dealer-directed protocols. We're really pleased with our most recent release on portfolio trading we would admit that we were behind there, but we think we have closed the gap. It's very early days in electronic trading and portfolio trading and portfolio trading in general.  We're getting great encouragement from investors and dealers to keep going because none of the solutions in the market are perfect, but that was one of the share gaps that we had that we're working very hard to close and have a series of releases and enhancements coming up, and I think one to watch there. And then finally, D2D trading has not really been a strength of market access. We focus on 75% or 80% of the market that's driven by institutional investors. So as dealers have embraced electronic solutions, some of our competitors that have dealer-to-dealer businesses and voice brokers are benefiting from that transition in the short run slightly more than we are. But we're encouraged that we're participating in it through dealer RFQ into Open Trading. So I think it's a variety of factors, but I'm quite confident that the advantages of Open Trading come through longer term and when we get back to more normal levels of volatility."

One of them is around people, and we ended the quarter with right around 640 people. We expect to add and have clear line of sight on on adding another 40 people, albeit 25 of those are in our college grad program. But another big swing factor has to do with variable compensation. A lot of that is tied to operating performance. And at least right now, what we got built into the model is more of a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year, which are fairly muted market volumes and fairly muted market conditions. So that variable compensation can swing up or down depending on operating performance. The other piece of the expenses that does fluctuate and again, tied to market volumes and market conditions will be around clearing expenses. And you saw the savings that came through this year. largely as a result of our self-clearing transition activities in the U.K. and our settlement agent transition activities -- I'm sorry, in the U.S. and then the settlement agent transition in the U.K. But depending on market conditions and market volumes that those clearing costs can swing up or down as well.

And really, the nontransaction will be around post-trade and on the Information Services side. And in the first half of the year on post-trade, you did see a big pickup because of the integration of the regulatory reporting hub business, it's about $8 million in revenue in the first half of the year. It's more than meeting our expectations in terms of revenue contribution. We've also seen a pretty big increase in organic revenue. We have new services in the past 12 months around SFTR reporting and repo matching. There's new client additions as a couple of firms have exited the transaction reporting market. When we look at back half of the year for post-trade, a pretty good proxy would be what you see in the first half of the year. And what that would translate to would be 30% plus growth on the organic side and then overlay the Reg Reporting Hub side. So back half of the year is similar. Although I will tell you something in post-trade it is, our transaction reporting revenue is somewhat tied to volume. So there is -- there are tiered volume plans, so volume does matter. But used the first half is a pretty good proxy there. On the information services side, if you look at the first half of the year and revenue was up about 11%, the really good underlying news there. When you look at recurring revenue, it was up around 19%. So any given quarter, we may have some onetime one-off sales. They were much bigger in 2020 than what we're seeing here in 2021. So when you really carve into the information services revenue, 19% growth year-over-year in recurring revenue. Guidance for the rest of the year, if you look back sort of historically, and we've talked about this in the past, we've grown information services revenue at low double digits. We've got a pretty decent pipeline of opportunities looking into the second half of the year. And we're looking at sort of forecast around that. We're looking at double-digit growth year-over-year on the Information Services side. So a continuation of what you saw in the first half."

As Chris mentioned, we think it's around 4% of TRACE volume now, that's up from probably 2.5% or so a year ago. We do believe it's situational, right? So I don't think you're going to see this become something more than 8% or 10% of the market over time, but there are good results in certain situations and certain kind of basket trades that investors are reporting. So it's really important for us to continue our work around enhancing the protocols for clients. And as I mentioned, we're off to a really good start. You do see some indexation balancing going on in portfolios currently. You see some tax trades going on and tax swaps going on. They usually go to somewhere between 1 and 3 dealers right now. So this is part of the dealer-directed business that I talked about earlier. So it's all part of the -- what I think is the transformation of the market-making model and risk transfer model. This is a new tool and in the shed that investors and dealers are using, and we're really pleased to be now part of that ecosystem and expect to invest even more heavily in the future. I will also say that the use of portfolio trading will ebb and flow with volatility. It's much easier to conduct basket trades when volatility is low. And that, again, as you -- if you look at second quarter of last year, with pricing moving around as much as it was, it's more difficult to do basket trades that require more time in constructing the basket and negotiating the price for the basket. And I will also say, when I look at what we're doing and others, it's trade assist and trade processing. The STP benefits in my mind, are the key piece because of the number of transactions. It's -- today, it's a pure client to a limited number of dealers protocol. So it's not a liquidity solution currently

And the progress that we made in the first half of the year is coming in both hard currency and local markets and it's coming in all regions.

Happy to take a first shot at that, Alex, thank you for the question. But the first disclaimer is that the estimates you see are just that they are estimates provided by venues that have wildly different reporting standards. So I think there are some analysts that are trying to parse through all the reporting differences to get through the differences around double counting fully electronic versus electronic processed and then segment reporting across D2D, D2D and even all-to-all. So there are very different standards, and it's really hard to get to an accurate answer on what the share is today because of those differences. This is something that you know FIMSAC took up as a recommendation that we should have standards so that it's easier for people to follow the share trends in electronic trading, which I believe had something to do with FINRA at least addressing some of the double accounting issues that you're aware of that have been showing up in ATS. They are probably part of that 40% number that you're citing. But having said that, I do think that we're going to see the benefits in higher share of electronic trading. And for investment grade, I don't see any reason why we wouldn't be thinking 60%, 70% of the market down the road and an increase in velocity. And every other market, when you have a central marketplaces like ours that are connecting all participants in 1 central liquidity pool and growing use of trading automation that's reducing trading costs, you do get an increase in velocity. And absent the second quarter, we've gone on a really nice uptrend over the last 4 or 5 quarters on trading velocity. And that's actually probably the bigger opportunity because velocity came down following bank regulatory reform and the constraints on bank trading and balance sheets. It's now starting to go back up because the dealers have transformed their market-making models they're getting in the middle of more trades than ever before. Investors are using automated tools like Auto-X and Auto [Indiscernible] regularly to. So when we think about 5, 10 years, Alex, the share gains are part of the story, but velocity is an equal. Potentially even greater part of the story, if you look at what has happened to velocity and other asset classes when automation takes hold the way it looks like it's starting to in credit."

So the integration of our rates platform and our credit trading platform has really gotten to full production, and we're quite comfortable with that.

Open Trading in particular, across the full breadth of the treasury products group, which will be out before year-end. And that's really a unique offering that we don't see any other competitor offering in the treasury space, where both dealer liquidity and alternative dealer liquidity can be found in 1 place in response to large RFQs across both on the run and off the run. So really excited about 2021 and the treasury space here in the U.S."

And then we've got net downs on restricted stock vesting and some of the stock option exercises. And we use those repurchases in the aggregate to offset dilution. And they do vary from quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the the buyback plans, it does vary as dependent on the grid in place. It's dependent on our share price. But you're correct. Just looking at the buyback plans, repurchases were higher than the first quarter. But we're going to continue to maintain that philosophy of using repurchases to offset dilution. It's why the diluted share count hasn't really varied in the last 7 years. So right now -- and this is both dividends and repurchases. No plans to change our capital return programs. We revisit the conversation with the full board every quarter. But today, we feel like we have the right balance in place."

As you mentioned, there are probably appropriate places for distributed ledger to offer efficiencies in settlement that the key piece of the products that we trade are centrally cleared. And so when you move into a centrally cleared market, distributed ledger can only thrive if it comes with the central guarantee of a clearing house. Those are some of the key benefits of clearing house efficiencies. And so as distributed ledger steps into securitized products, there are some limited areas where they do provide efficiencies. But unless they come with that guarantee settlement and the netting benefit of the guaranteed settlement, it becomes challenging to see the full efficiency of distributed ledger real-time settlement in liquid securities is not what everyone is racing towards because of the turnover can impact turnover in the market, given the centralized clearing efficiency. So distributed ledger is watched. We see it in a couple of instruments where it may be more efficient. It may actually be interesting in new issue markets where it's much quicker to bring securitized product to market. So there's a number of applications that we see it entering. But obviously, we trade highly liquid, centrally cleared product. And right now, we don't see distributed ledgers stepping into that, but we will continue to watch it."

Obviously, many of our clients offer index-related products, either managed or in the ETF form -- We do think there's an exciting future in indexation and fixed income. We look at the market and the indices that are in the market and they were not originally designed for what I'd call highly liquid tradable products. So we think there's a new opportunity in indices across the fixed income market globally to start offering highly liquid index products. We currently have several industries that we have published and are providing to the market. You can see them on our website. But we do think there's a great opportunity in the further indexation of the market. We also see custom baskets growing in the market and custom indices that clients are in demand for. So some unique opportunities across the index landscape in fixed income. And I will tell you, I think it's very early days when we look at some of the indexation and other asset classes, particularly equities. So we're excited about the benefits of indexation, not only for the overall market and our clients, but also the benefits for our competitive landscape. We thrive in ETF volumes. So as fixed income products make their way into index-based ETFs, we see our business thriving. And this quarter is an example of where ETF trading volume was down, and that certainly impacted our competitive position. But very excited about the future of indexation. Excited about our role in indexation in the future and looking forward to new products being launched in the coming months and years."

Quiet market conditions in global credit markets led to a soft quarter with revenue of $176 million, down 5%. Operating income was $87 million. And operating margin was 49%.  
Diluted EPS of $1.77, down 20% year-over-year. Year-over-year comparisons were challenging when looking at Q2 last year, when our revenue was up 47% and EPS was up 73%. However, 2-year compound annual growth rates showed strong revenue growth of 19%, and operating income growth of 20% this quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, consistent with our long-term growth rates. 
Market share levels this quarter in high grade and high yield were similar to last year. FINRA has also announced that they will revise their historical TRACE market volumes on July 26 to adjust for the rapid increase in double counting for fixed income ATS volume. We will revisit our market share estimates once we see the adjustments from FINRA. We continue to add active clients to our network. And for the quarter, we set new records with 1,840 firms active globally.  
Emerging markets growth was a highlight for the quarter with volume up 11% year-over-year, while total EM market volumes were down an estimated 17%. Our estimated EM market share set new highs for the quarter. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress in municipal bond trading with record volume during the quarter. 
International clients represented 32% of our global volume in the second quarter, a new record for geographic client diversification. 
Earlier this week, we announced that Charles Li, the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has joined the MarketAxess Board of Directors. Charles brings extensive experience in market structure, exchanges and electronic trading and will add important experience to our Board, especially in the Asia region. 
Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions.  Subdued market conditions led to much lower credit market volumes in the second quarter. Institutional investors report lower fixed income trading activity and ETF market participants were much wider than normal, especially in high yield. 
For the quarter, high-grade corporate bond indices were locked in an 8-basis point trading range, following a range of 138 basis points 1 year ago. TRACE high-grade volume was down 20% and TRACE high-yield volume down 14% versus last year. Fixed income ETF share trading was down 31% in the second quarter versus last year. 
The lower left chart shows the normal deviations in high-grade and high yield share gains versus a multiyear linear regression. We have been through quiet trading periods before and fully expect a mean reversion for market volatility and trading volumes. We remain optimistic that the increase in fixed income trading automation and all-to-all trading will lead to an increase in trading velocity. 
Treasury yields ticked up during the second quarter but have since moved lower once again. Treasury yields impact corporate bond duration and also our high-grade fee capture.  
Slide 5 provides an update on Open Trading. Our unique Open Trading liquidity pool continues to drive important transaction cost savings to our clients in spite of the low volatility environment. Clients saved an estimated $127 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. The vast majority of investor and dealer-initiated orders on MarketAxess are available in 1 single liquidity pool. 
On average, our network delivered 29,000 orders per day and over $15 billion in notional value into the Open Trading central marketplace. We believe that our unique global institutional network with over 1,800 active firms in Open Trading, increases trading opportunities, reduces transaction costs and reduces market risk during high volatility periods. 
Our dealer-initiated Open Trading volume was up 28% year-over-year. Dealers are finding great value in both making markets and taking liquidity on the market access system. 
The D2D client segment is moving rapidly to embrace electronic trading solutions. We are also pleased with the early success in our diversity dealer initiative. We have now onboarded 12 minority and women-owned dealers for the new program and diversity dealer volume with investors is up 90% year-over-year in early days. This is a great example of using Open Trading to expand important trading relationships for investors and dealers.  
Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on new products and trading automation."

Slide 6 provides an update on our investment in new products and protocols.  
We recently announced enhancements to our portfolio trading solution, including integrating -- integrated net spotting and hedging capabilities supported through the MarketAxess grades platform. 
Since the technology release in late May, more than 95 portfolio trades have been completed on MarketAxess with 27 unique investor firms and 10 dealers. While portfolio trading makes up a small portion of the market, somewhere between 4% and 5% of TRACE, we are committed to further enhancing our portfolio trading solution. 
Our Mid-X sessions protocol was launched in the fall of 2020 and has seen significant adoption. $2.5 billion in eurobond volume was traded through Mid-X in the second quarter, up 79% from the prior quarter. We expect to expand Mid-X to U.S. credit products in the second half of this year. 
Shifting focus to new product areas, municipal bond trading on MarketAxess grew to a record $6.8 billion in the quarter. Also within the quarter, we announced the completed acquisition of MuniBrokers, which transacts approximately $330 million in municipal bond volume per day, which is currently not included in our muni bond volume totals. 
Our MarketAxess rates offering is expanding beyond our initial Click-To-Trade solution with RFQ being launched this month and our all-to-all Open Trading functionality for treasuries launching later this year. We continue to deliver our clients with a choice of trading protocols across the full breadth of fixed income products, supported by a combination of dealer and all-to-all liquidity. 
Slide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $41.5 billion in volume and over 218,000 trades. 98 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 the year prior. 
Today, Auto-X represents 17% of total trade count and 6% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in the second quarter, up 30% from the same period last year. We've also seen continued adoption of our Auto-Responder functionality. Auto-Responder allows client firms to automatically respond with liquidity based on a set of predefined criteria. This functionality is a critical step in helping clients avoid the cost of regularly crossing the spread. 
Slide 8 provides the summary of our trading volume across product categories. Our U.S. high-grade volumes were down 22% year-over-year to $324 billion for the quarter, largely due to a significant decline in market volumes and benign market conditions in the second quarter. Estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE market volumes were down 16% year-over-year. 
Volumes in our other credit category were up 5% year-over-year to $345 billion for the quarter. Our trading volume in emerging market bonds and eurobonds outpaced the change in estimated market volumes. 
Similar to U.S. high-grade, the most significant factor weighing on the decline in our U.S. high-yield trading volume was the double-digit decline in estimated market volumes. Our green bond trading initiative continues to support clients' ESG-related investment mandates. In the second quarter, over $13 billion worth of green bonds were traded on our platform, resulting in over 65,000 trees being planted. We have now planted over 131,000 trees since the beginning of the year, which nearly surpasses our 2020 full year record.

On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance.  
Revenue was $176 million, down 5% year-over-year. Commissions were 9% lower, resulting from the 10% decline in credit trading volume. Post-trade services revenue more than doubled to $9.8 million and reflects $3.8 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition and healthy organic growth, driven by new clients and new services. 
Information services revenue was up 17% year-over-year, principally due to recurring data sales. The weaker dollar favorably impacted both post-trade and Information Services revenue each by around $600,000. 
Operating income was $87 million, down 16% year-over-year, and operating margin was 49.4% in the second quarter. If we excluded the impact of the acquisition-related intangible amortization expense and nonrecurring integration costs, operating margin would have been 52%. Despite weaker market volumes and difficult market conditions, we continue to add personnel and invest in our organic and inorganic initiatives. The effective tax rate was 21.4% on a year-to-date basis. We expect the effective tax rate to vary quarter-to-quarter in the second half of the year and are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance of 22% to 24%.  
On Slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. On a composite basis, the majority of the 13% decrease in credit transaction fees were driven by a decline in estimated market volumes. Lower rates transaction fees was due principally to a decline in estimated U.S. treasury market volumes. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down around 4% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We didn't make any fee plan changes during the quarter and the sequential decrease was due to a variety of factors, including slightly lower duration. 
Our other credit category fee per million of $194, was lower than both the first quarter 2021 and second quarter 2020 levels due principally to the impact of a change in product mix and shift in protocols.  
During the second quarter, there was a heavier weighting to emerging markets in eurobond volume and a lighter weighting to high-yield volume. The increase in other credit distribution fees was principally due to the inclusion of MuniBrokers subscription and license fees of $1.1 million. In the near term, we expect the subscription and license fees will run around $1.3 million per quarter. 
Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Second quarter expenses were up 11% year-over-year. Excluding the $5.1 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub and MuniBrokers businesses, expenses were up 4% year-over-year. 
Sequentially, expenses were down 3.1%. Approximately half of the decline in compensation and benefits was due to lower variable incentive pay, which is tied directly to operating performance, and the residual was due to lower employer taxes, which are always seasonally higher in the first quarter. 
Pure salary expense was up almost $1 million versus the first quarter as we continue to execute against our hiring plan. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the amortization of acquired intangibles on the MuniBrokers transaction. 
Marketing and advertising costs can swing period-to-period and the second quarter reflects a more active level of advertising campaigns and return of some T&E expense. We're at the mid-year mark and are now expecting that full year expenses may end up at the low end of our expense guidance range of $370 million to $386 million. 
On Slide 12, we provide cash flow and capital management information. Cash and investments as of June 30 were $440 million and trailing 12 months free cash flow was $320 million.  
During the second quarter, we paid out the quarterly cash dividend of $25 million and repurchased a total of 49,000 shares at a cost of $20 million through a combination of net down and option exercise and restricted stock vesting activity and our share buyback program. We didn't borrow against the $500 million syndicated revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility used to facilitate Open Trading settlement activity in the second quarter.  
Based on the second quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

Because at the midway mark in July, the first half has the 4th of July holiday weekend with very low volumes on the short trading day on July 2. So it's -- with 8 trading days left, we kind of think the best of the month is yet to come. 
But you're absolutely right. If you look at just the last 3 or 4 trading days with even some signs of volatility coming back. It has been beneficial for our business. And the place where it's most noticeable is obviously the ETF community gets engaged in our high-yield product, in particular, when there's volatility in high yield spreads, which we have seen more recently. So who knows whether last or not, but at least some positive signs on the volatility front."

And I do have to mention that I saw you running in Sag Harbor, and I think our volumes are growing faster than your pace, I noticed. But -- on Open Trading, as we think about Open Trading, we want Open Trading to really penetrate across all markets. We think it's a unique offering. It brings alternative liquidity into those markets. It has a network effect of liquidity. It also allows clients to participate and avoid spread crossing and be liquidity providers when the moment is opportune for them. 
So Open Trading across all products is a key part of our strategy long term. In munis, we see Open Trading as a sizable portion of the market. Open Trading is about 45% of the volume in the muni market. So it's actually an important component to the muni market and that network effect. 
Obviously, the acquisition of MuniBrokers, we intend to populate our Open Trading content with MuniBrokers data. So the linkage with MuniBrokers will come through Open Trading as well, again, leveraging that Open Trading solution. 
In the rates market, it's a really unique opportunity that we see and one that actually the Fed sees as well and recently published a report, a study on last year's challenges in the treasury market. So our strategy is to deploy our Open Trading solution in the treasury market. We plan to deliver that before year-end and have a very nice plan around not only RFQ, but Open Trading as well. 
And another key attribute of our Open Trading solution will be across the full breadth of treasury products, both on the run and off the run which allows a unique product offering in treasuries that we don't see in the market today. 
So all of that's coming. And as I mentioned, Open Trading in things like eurobonds, EM, continues to see sizable growth, even in a more challenging quarter than we just witnessed."

As a r",504,"Yes. Happy to take that one, Patrick. And I do think that different protocols work best in different environments, and you saw us try during the high volatility period a year ago when price dispersion in credit was much higher than it is currently. As a result, the additive liquidity of Open Trading and the price improvement from Open Trading was very significant to market participants and drove volumes and share through our platform. 
In an environment like this, where there is very limited volatility, there's less price dispersion, what we're hearing from institutional investors right now is there's actually a shortage of bonds because there's so much liquidity in the system. And as low as our rates are even lower elsewhere in the world. So asset managers are getting inflows and that increases the focus on the new issue calendar and drive some business back at the margin to dealers. 
The other point that I made earlier, Patrick, that you're well aware of is, we have introduced a lot of new market participants to credit trading through Open Trading the ETFR community is very active when vol is high and much less active with vol at low levels as they have been recently. 
And when you look at our high yield share difference, it's almost entirely driven by the swing in ETF market participants, not because they've gone anywhere else, or they don't want to trade. It's just that the arbitrage opportunity has been much less. And as a result, their levels and their share of TRACE are down significantly. 
And I do continue to believe, as Chris mentioned, that our Open Trading solution is differentiated. It will do well when volatility is high. A lot of the success that you see away from us is really dealer-directed protocols. We're really pleased with our most recent release on portfolio trading. We would admit that we were behind there, but we think we have closed the gap. It's very early days in electronic trading and portfolio trading and portfolio trading in general.  We're getting great encouragement from investors and dealers to keep going because none of the solutions in the market are perfect, but that was one of the share gaps that we had that we're working very hard to close and have a series of releases and enhancements coming up, and I think one to watch there. 
And then finally, D2D trading has not really been a strength of MarketAxess. We focus on 75% or 80% of the market that's driven by institutional investors. So as dealers have embraced electronic solutions, some of our competitors that have dealer-to-dealer businesses and voice brokers are benefiting from that transition in the short run slightly more than we are, but we're encouraged that we're participating in it through dealer RFQ into Open Trading. So I think it's a variety of factors, but I'm quite confident that the advantages of Open Trading come through longer term and when we get back to more normal levels of volatility."

But another big swing factor has to do with variable compensation. A lot of that is tied to operating performance. And at least right now, what we got built into the model is more of a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year, which are fairly muted market volumes and fairly muted market conditions. So that variable compensation can swing up or down depending on operating performance. 
The other piece of the expense is that, that does fluctuate and again, tied to market volumes and market conditions will be around clearing expenses. And you saw the savings that came through this year. largely as a result of our self-clearing transition activities in the U.K. and our settlement agent transition activities -- I'm sorry, in the U.S. and then the settlement agent transition in the U.K. But depending on market conditions and market volumes that those clearing costs can swing up or down as well.

And really, the nontransactional will be around post-trade and on the Information Services side. And in the first half of the year on post-trade, you did see a big pickup because of the integration of the Regulatory Reporting Hub business, it's about $8 million in revenue in the first half of the year. It's more than meeting our expectations in terms of revenue contribution. 
We've also seen a pretty big increase in organic revenue. We have new services in the past 12 months around SFTR reporting and repo matching. There's new client additions as a couple of firms have exited the transaction reporting market. When we look at back half of the year for post-trade, a pretty good proxy would be what you see in the first half of the year. And what that would translate to would be 30% plus growth on the organic side and then overlay the Reg Reporting Hub side. 
So back half of the year is similar. Although, I will tell you something in post-trade it is, our transaction reporting revenue is somewhat tied to volume. So there is -- there are tiered volume plans, so volume does matter. But use of first half is a pretty good proxy there. 
On the Information Services side, if you look at the first half of the year and revenue was up about 11%, the really good underlying news there. When you look at recurring revenue, it was up around 19%. So any given quarter, we may have some onetime one-off sales. They were much bigger in 2020 than what we're seeing here in 2021. So when you really carve into the Information Services revenue, 19% growth year-over-year in recurring revenue. 
Guidance for the rest of the year, if you look back sort of historically, and we've talked about this in the past, we've grown information services revenue low double digits. We've got a pretty decent pipeline of opportunities looking into the second half of the year. And we're looking at sort of forecast around that. We're looking at double-digit growth year-over-year on the Information Services side. So a continuation of what you saw in the first half."

As Chris mentioned, we think it's around 4% of TRACE volume now, that's up from probably 2.5% or so a year ago. We do believe it's situational, right? So I don't think you're going to see this become something more than 8% or 10% of the market over time, but there are good results in certain situations and certain kind of basket trades that investors are reporting. 
So it's really important for us to continue our work around enhancing the protocols for clients. And as I mentioned, we're off to a really good start. You do see some indexation, balancing going on in portfolios currently. You see some tax trades going on and tax swaps going on. They usually go to somewhere between 1 and 3 dealers right now. So this is part of the dealer-directed business that I talked about earlier. 
So it's all part of the -- what I think is the transformation of the market-making model and risk transfer model. This is a new tool and in the shed that investors and dealers are using, and we're really pleased to be now part of that ecosystem and expect to invest even more heavily in the future. 
I will also say that the use of portfolio trading will ebb and flow with volatility. It's much easier to conduct basket trades when volatility is low. And that, again, as you -- if you look at second quarter of last year, with pricing moving around as much as it was, it's more difficult to do basket trades that require more time in constructing the basket and negotiating the price for the basket. 
And I will also say, when I look at what we're doing and others, it's trade assist and trade processing. The STP benefits in my mind, are the key piece because of the number of transactions. It's -- today, it's a pure client to a limited number of dealers protocol. So it's not a liquidity solution currently but that is subject to change too, as people think about different ways that they might execute portfolio trades down the road."

And we're seeing high demand from clients to execute with our diversity dealer initiative. Portfolio trading has natural limits to it in a marketplace like the fixed income market, both from the liquidity provision side and risk transfer as well as from the client side. And part of our enhancements to portfolio trading is to make sure clients understand the value of trading as a portfolio versus the value as trading individual line item lists. We offer both solutions, both portfolio, all our nonofferings as well as lists and the pricing dynamic can change as Rick mentioned from quarter-to-quarter. So -- while it is a sizeable portion of the market at 4%, 5%, we do think it has growth limits to it. And will change as a percentage during certain market environments."

And many times, you'll see a sessions trade come off of a portfolio trade. So some of those bonds that are trading in portfolios that dealers don't want in inventory will find their way into a Mid-X so -- a session trade as well. So we do see sizable matches happening in our Eurobond Mid-X solution, and we  would expect similar and maybe even larger sizes matching in our Mid-X solution as it rolls out in U.S. corporates. But we do see client demand. We do see dealer demand, and we're really seeing huge growth in our dealer RFQ solution. This would be another really dealer-to-dealer offering in the U.S."

And we are quickly adding new clients in APAC, CEMEA and Latin America. So we're onboarding clients. And we think we have a superior electronic trading and liquidity solution that we are promoting around the world. 
And so we're really excited about the market share gains and the momentum that we have on volume and importantly, the active clients that we see internationally. And there's so much runway left there because it's not just one market. We're trading hard currency, EM bonds in all regions, but importantly, we're trading EM bonds in 26 local markets and local currencies, too. 
So there's a massive long-term opportunity there. And the progress that we made in the first half of the year is coming in both hard currency and local markets and it's coming in all regions. So this has really held up the international business results in the first half of the year, even though EM markets, in general, are suffering from the same lack of volatility that you see in U.S. credit markets. So space to watch. 
We're really excited about the size of the opportunity and the growing competitive position and market share that we have in EM. We've got so much more to do. APAC is not only is the underlying market growing very quickly, but our own volume and client base and market share is growing quite actively, too."

What does the growth path looks like to get you there, i.e., like what are the key kind of customer pain points that you think you need to solve to drive that share higher?

Happy to take a first shot at that, Alex, thank you for the question. But the first disclaimer is that the estimates you see are just that they are estimates provided by venues that have wildly different reporting standards. So I think there are some analysts that are trying to parse through all the reporting differences to get through the differences around double counting, fully electronic versus electronic processed and then segment reporting across C2D, D2D and even all-to-all. 
So there are very different standards, and it's really hard to get to an accurate answer on what the share is today because of those differences. This is something that you know FIMSAC took up as a recommendation that we should have standards so that it's easier for people to follow the share trends in electronic trading, which I believe had something to do with FINRA at least addressing some of the double accounting issues that you're aware of that have been showing up in ATS. 
They are probably part of that 40% number that you're citing. But having said that, I do think that we're going to see the benefits in higher share of electronic trading. 
And for investment grade, I don't see any reason why we wouldn't be thinking 60%, 70% of the market down the road and an increase in velocity, and every other market, when you have a central marketplaces like ours that are connecting all participants in one central liquidity pool and growing use of trading automation that's reducing trading costs, you do get an increase in velocity. 
And absent the second quarter, we've gone on a really nice uptrend over the last 4 or 5 quarters on trading velocity. And that's actually probably the bigger opportunity because velocity came down following bank regulatory reform and the constraints on bank trading and balance sheets. 
It's now starting to go back up because the dealers have transformed their market-making models, they're getting in the middle of more trades than ever before. Investors are using automated tools like Auto-X and Auto [ arm ] regularly too. So when we think about 5, 10 years, Alex, the share gains are part of the story, but velocity is an equal or potentially even greater part of the story, if you look at what has happened to velocity and other asset classes when automation takes hold, the way it looks like, it's starting to in credit."

Open Trading in particular, across the full breadth of the treasury products group, which will be out before year-end.

And they do vary from quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the  buyback plans, it does vary. It's dependent on the grid in place. It's dependent on our share price. But you're correct. Just looking at the buyback plans, repurchases were higher in Q2 than the first quarter. But we're going to continue to maintain that philosophy of using repurchases to offset dilution. It's why the diluted share count hasn't really varied in the last 7 years. So right now -- and this is both dividends and repurchases. No plans to change our capital return programs.

As you mentioned, there are probably appropriate places for distributed ledger to offer efficiencies in settlement that the key piece of the products that we trade are centrally cleared. And so when you move into a centrally cleared market, distributed ledger can only thrive if it comes with the central guarantee of a clearing house. Those are some of the key benefits of clearing house efficiencies. 
And so as distributed ledger steps into securitized products, there are some limited areas where they do provide efficiencies. But unless they come with that guarantee settlement and the netting benefit of the guaranteed settlement, it becomes challenging to see the full efficiency of distributed ledger real-time settlement in liquid securities is not what everyone is racing towards because of the turnover can impact turnover in the market, given the centralized clearing efficiency. 
So distributed ledger is watched. We see it in a couple of instruments where it may be more efficient. It may actually be interesting in new issue markets where it's much quicker to bring securitized product to market. So there's a number of applications that we see it entering. But obviously, we trade highly liquid, centrally cleared product. And right now, we don't see distributed ledger stepping into that, but we will continue to watch it."

Operating income was $74 million, and operating margin was 46%. EPS of $1.52 was down 15%, reflecting our ongoing investments in new data, trading and post-trade solutions. Credit market trading faces headwinds currently with a combination of historically low credit spreads and credit spread volatility. These conditions have persisted over the last 3 quarters and history suggests they will revert to the mean over time. Our international business is showing strong growth through volume and market share gains in eurobonds and emerging markets, post-trade services and product expansion. We are pleased to add Chinese government bonds to our offering through China Bond Connect and CIBM Direct. Slide 3 provides an update on market conditions. 
Market volumes have been negatively impacted by the current low levels of bond yields, credit spreads and volatility. During these periods, price dispersion of bids and offers shrinks temporarily. Our liquidity and pricing advantage comes through most clearly at times of normal to high spreads and volatility. And we believe that there are many factors that could positively impact bond volatility and in the periods ahead. As yields have started to increase from historically low levels, average years to maturity traded on our system has come down about 6%. Average years to maturity is one of the factors that causes fluctuations in our high-grade fee capture. We are watching the emerging news on inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and the China real estate market closely. We believe that it is likely that we will see tapering of Central Bank bond buying in the periods ahead, which is likely to lead to more normalized yield levels and volatility in bond markets around the world. Slide 4 highlights our growth in international markets. In spite of the low levels of yields around the world, we are showing strong growth in our emerging market and eurobond product areas. Eurobond volumes are up 22% year-over-year against the backdrop of lower market volumes. Our estimated market share reached new highs in eurobonds during the quarter. Emerging market volumes were up 19% with estimated market volumes up 1%, reflecting share gains in global EM debt trading. We are seeing strong growth rates in both hard currency EM bonds denominated in dollars, euros and yen, as well as local market trading. 
The addition of China increases our local market coverage to 28 local markets across Latin America, CEMEA and APAC regions. This quarter, we set new records in global active trading clients and international client firms. This expands our broad client network and creates additional cross-selling opportunities. We are underway with client onboarding for China bond connect and expect an active quarter ahead. As the second largest government bond market in the world, China provides a meaningful increase in our total market opportunity. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on product expansion and automation."

Open Trading continues to support credit market liquidity by offering all participants the chance to engage with the market. In the third quarter, over 25,000 orders and $13 billion in notional value was available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. Dealers have also realized the benefits of Open Trading and are increasingly seeking anonymous all-to-all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 20% year-over-year to $59 billion during the quarter. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost saving opportunities. Despite compressed credit market spreads, clients faced an estimated $121 million transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements delivered by Open Trading. The acquisitions of LiquidityEdge and MuniBrokers highlight our investment in new markets and the growing application of Open Trading across the fixed income landscape. $910 billion of U.S. treasury trading volume was executed on market access in the quarter, up 22% from the prior year. 
We have made several enhancements to our trading offering in recent months, including our launch of all-to-all Click-To-Trade functionality and extending RFQ trading capabilities for client to dealer orders. The expansion of Open Trading for U.S. treasuries is a critical priority for us and aligns with recent G30 recommendations for an all-to-all marketplace in treasuries. Municipal bond trading on market access grew 92% and to $5.4 billion in the quarter. An additional $17.4 billion in volume was conducted through MuniBrokers, our interdealer electronic platform, which we currently do not include in our muni bond volume totals. 
Integration efforts of the MuniBroker platform are well underway, and we are targeting the fourth quarter for the initial phase of our integration of the platform into our Open Trading network. We believe these investments in government bond and municipal bond trading solutions will add approximately 25% to our long-term addressable market opportunity. Slide 6 highlights the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading on market access reached new records in the quarter, growing to $42 billion in volume and over 224,000 trades. 115 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 last year. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 7% of our total items. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.4 million algo responses in the third quarter, up 17% from the same period last year. The growth of dealer algorithms and our automated trading tools are driving a steady increase in the average number of responses on market access. In the third quarter, we saw an average of 7 responses per inquiry versus 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020. This demonstrates enhancements in our liquidity as a result of the increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. 
Slide 7 demonstrates the growth from diversifying our business initiatives. The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 101% year-over-year. The addition of Continental European clients to our suite of regulatory reporting services through this acquisition has further bolstered our unique data solutions. Through these types of post-trade data sources, we have seen sizable benefits to our data solutions like Axess All and Composite+. Both Axess All and Composite+ helped drive our information services revenue to $9.6 million in the quarter, which is up 13% year-over-year. Combined information services and post-trade revenue now account for 12% of total revenues, up from 8% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Following enhancements to our portfolio trading solution in May, we have seen significant traction with our new functionality. 54 unique investor firms and 13 dealers were active since May and drove record volume of $8.9 billion in the quarter. We believe our active client group is the same group of participants active in the market-wide portfolio trading today. Activity in our session-based protocol, Mid-X, reached record volumes in the quarter of $3.4 billion. We plan on expanding Mid-X beyond eurobonds to U.S. credit later this year. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials."

Third quarter revenue was $162 million, down 1% from the prior year. The 5% decline in commissions was offset by the 100% uplift in post-trade revenue. The increase in post-trade revenue includes $3.4 million of trade reporting revenue generated from new clients added through the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Information Service revenue was up 13% year-over-year due to new data sales and the positive impact of foreign exchange due to the weaker U.S. dollar. The annual contract value for new recurring data contract sales for the first 9 months of 2021 has exceeded all of 2020. 
The sequential pickup in other income was due to foreign currency transaction gains. Excluding activity such as foreign exchange gains and losses, we anticipate the quarterly run rate for the other income expense line to be about $1 million of expense. The effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter and 21.6% year-to-date. Slide 9 provides an overview of commission revenue, trading volume and fees per million. The 9% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower U.S. credit trading volume and lower overall capture. The 17% decline in U.S. high-grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration driven by the increase in bond yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. 
We also experienced some dealer movement to a fixed fee plan from an all variable fee plan. And this explains the increase in U.S. high-grade distribution fees as fixed fee plans provide for higher fixed distribution fees, but lower transaction fees. Other credit fees per million was lower year-over-year due to a higher mix of emerging market and Eurobond volume that command lower fees. The third quarter 2021 other credit distribution fees includes $1.2 million of MuniBrokers subscription and license fees. Slide 10 provides expense detail. Third quarter expenses were up 16% year-over-year, and include $5.5 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs associated with the regulatory reporting hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition costs, expenses were up 8.4%. 
The increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher salary and benefit expense as we continue to add employees to support our product and geographical expansion. The $4.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense includes $2.5 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. M&A integration costs and higher recruiting fees contributed to the increase in professional and consulting fees year-over-year. The 32% decline in clearing costs reflect transaction cost savings from our strategic decision to convert to a self-clearing model back in August 2020. We are updating our full year 2021 expense guidance range to $360 million to $365 million down from a range of $370 million to $386 million. The updated expense guidance reflects, among other items, lower incentive compensation and variable clearing costs. Slide 11 provides an update on cash flow and capital management. As of September 30, our cash and investments were $458 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $320 million. 
During the quarter, we paid the $25 million quarterly dividend to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 9,000 shares. During the third quarter, we did not have any borrowings on the 1-year $500 million revolving credit facility for the $200 million secured facility. And on October 15, we replaced the 1-year revolving credit facility with a new 3-year facility. Based on our third quarter results, our Board of Directors approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

But we're starting to pilot a market conditions index, and I said a year ago on this call that no one should expect the credit trading conditions of last year to continue indefinitely. I will say exactly the same this year from very low levels of volatility that you also shouldn't expect these levels of very low spreads and volatility to continue either. And we certainly, as a more developed business are impacted by what is going on in the overall market, and you probably saw this quarter that fixed income trading revenue for the large banks was down 15% year-over-year. So they are seeing the same impact from the current market conditions than we are. When I turn to competition, I think there are 2 big stories this year. One is the rapid transition of dealer-to-dealer trading from voice-based brokerage to electronic trading. And we see that as our competitors. We also see that quite clearly here with dealers initiating more orders into our Open Trading platform. So that's been one of the themes this year is the dealer-to-dealer business has moved away from some of the traditional voice brokerage firms that is now very actively deployed on the electronic trading networks, including our own. It has not historically been one of our big areas of focus, but Open Trading is providing entry point for D2D training. The second is the growth of portfolio trading, where portfolio trading has grown from something around 2.5% or 3% of TRACE a year ago to around 5% of TRACE now. And the processing benefits for portfolios are significant. So given the large number of line items, electronic processing is critical to the effort. It does not today include new forms of liquidity. It is pure C2D trading. And we are happy to see progress with clients and dealers utilizing our own portfolio trading solution. And I think those are the 2 themes this year on the competitive front that I would point out. And beyond that, I think market conditions have been part of the story, and we're quite confident they will change over time."

I would just also mention that we do see differences in protocols in different environments, particularly protocols that involve derived price protocols. And what I mean by that, if you have a price forming market, they suffer in low-vol and tight spread environments, where you're driving price from the market, things like mid-market sessions. In a low volatility environment, you'll see a gravitation to mid-market sessions or portfolio trading that are using end of price portfolio trades. In a fast market, in a volatile market, those solutions actually will lose market share. So overall, we've seen in the past, both portfolio trading in mid-market sessions get hurt by volatility. They're actually feeling the benefits of the lack of volatility right now."

So we are committed to invest in those opportunities and focusing on our trading system enhancements, the product and protocol expansion, our geographical footprint expansion. So I don't think the fact that we reduced our 2021 guidance has nothing to do with levering back on those investments. It's all to do with the variable operating expenses.

Rich, you managed to take a 2-question limit and make it a 5-question topic, which is totally fine, but happy to go through all of those. But the short answer on when the market conditions improve for our business model is we don't know, of course. But what we've done is we've looked at the last dozen years or so, and we pointed out previously, we did have similar conditions in 2014 and 2017. And really 2 quarters was a long time to sit at those low levels of spreads and low levels of credit spread volatility. So we're already beyond that today with the high-grade spread index sitting in a 5 basis point range all of 2021 so far. So history would say that we will see a change in. As I mentioned earlier, the ingredients for volatility are clearly increasing. Certainly, from my perspective, what we're seeing in wage pressures does not feel transitory nor do some of the increases that we're seeing in energy prices. So there certainly are core parts of the inflation story that I think are longer term in nature. And you still have the central banks, especially in Europe and here in the U.S., buying a lot of the net new issuance of government bonds and even mortgages in the case of the ECB, some corporates. So I would expect that some of the excess liquidity that we have in the market will start to reverse relatively soon because you still have a lot of quantitative easing going on and you have certainly above trajectory inflation numbers showing up regularly now in the data. So that would be 1 sign, I think, that market conditions are improving. On the regulatory front, we we see that there is continued talk about greater transparency in fixed income markets, which, of course, we wholeheartedly support. We have no idea why treasury has not moved to increased transparency of the U.S. treasury market given that FINRA now collects the data just as they do for corporate bonds and high yield. So we would be big proponents of increasing transparency in treasuries. We're also continually taking steps to increase transparency in European fixed income, as Chris mentioned earlier, as a byproduct of our growing post-trade reg reporting business. So those are very much attached at the and we think we're providing a valuable service back to our clients to provide those tools to them. Clearly, has a very busy agenda in front of him. We see topics like crypto and equity market payment for order flow, retail equity trading high on the list, but he does regularly mentioned fixed income transparency and potentially some improvements to the ATS regulatory structure, which we focused on at FIMSAC. And then on China, I'm not sure I perfectly understood the question, but the focus here domestically, of course, is on making sure that public companies that are registered to trade in the U.S. are complying with U.S. accounting and audit rules, which we think makes a lot of sense."

And what I mean by that we're really going after the largest investment fund complexes that need automation to solve the multiple tickets and trading that they have on their desk. And so it's really a workflow solution. The increased penetration is really increasing the size that clients are comfortable using a no-touch or low-touch solution for trading credit. And we're seeing those increases at the client level. So we continue to see growth. That's why it's achieved close to 20% of our trading activity is now through no-touch or low-touch automation solutions. And it's now reached 7% of our total volume. We would expect that to continue to grow as clients, continue to seek workflow solutions, particularly in an RFQ environment. There are benefits to Open Trading as a result of the adoption of things like Auto-Responder, which is one of our key automation tools that we rolled out. It's allowing clients to actually participate in responses to other clients or other dealers of requests for price. So that's -- it's having an interesting dynamic to the overall liquidity pool."

I was hoping maybe we could dig in a little bit further on the corporate credit side and just would be interested in your thoughts there on how you see the landscape evolving on the regulatory side. And in particular, there's been some noise around this Rule 15C2-11 just on, I think, initially it was supposed to apply to equities, at least that was our thinking, and now it seems like it may capture fixed income requirement that may require dealers to ensure information about issuers is updated, but my issuers are private. So just curious how much of a challenge do you see that is to fixed income markets, how do you see that playing out? And just more broadly, any sort of thoughts on the regulatory landscape?"

It's a good question because there's a lot of industry focus going into 15C2-11 in fixed income right now. And you're absolutely right. This is a 50-year-old rule that was originally designed to prevent fraud in in equity OTC markets",448,"Yes. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question because there's a lot of industry focus going into 15C2-11 in fixed income right now. And you're absolutely right. This is a 50-year-old rule that was originally designed to prevent fraud in in equity OTC markets with retail investors and particularly penny stock. So it's been around for a long time, and it's never really applied to fixed income. And there was a change in the pronouncement of Federal Register from the SEC recently that said that they viewed fixed income is being included in that 50-year rule. And it did come as a surprise because there had not been any staff guidance or really a discussion about the rule previously and no review period before the change came about. And I think everybody is trying to sort out exactly what it does mean and the commission did provide a delay of implementation until early next year. And I know it's under discussion and review with market participants and the commission currently. And there are some antiquated terms in there that nobody quite knows how to define currently like what exactly is a quotation medium because it does create restrictions for broker-dealers and publishing quotes on quotation mediums. So the challenge starts with what exactly is the definition of a quotation medium. From our perspective, we have a variety of protocols and the ones that are most actively used by our clients today. We do not believe would fall subject to the rule. It's not to say that all protocols would be exempt, but we believe that the ones that are used here primarily would be exempt. And the other thing that market participants have gotten comfortable with is that the majority of corporate bonds probably are not going to create an issue, and those are from public companies that are issuing bonds because the deals that broker dealers are required to validate that they have the information for readily available for public companies. Some of the private securities 144As and bonds are still subject to some interpretation, and that's where the area of focus is now. Large market areas like munis and treasuries have been exempted. So I think when all is said and done, we're going to be into a very small sliver of the U.S. market that could be impacted by the rule. And of course, we're hoping that the SEC will respond to some of the industry concerns about really publishing quotes to promote transparency, and in some cases, electronic trading that should be available for all fixed income securities and especially for institutional market participants. So that's what we know about where it stands right now."

But the new work from home flexibility is an added curveball to the overall offering of employment. So we have increased our flexibility around where people work to make sure we attract the highest and best tech talent on the market. And that's actually been very helpful in the candidates that we're seeing in the sophisticated talent that we're able to acquire. Across the board, we've seen great success with our graduate program. So we are hiring directly from colleges across the country and seen some great success with the new players coming into MarketAxess over the past few years. So great retention historically. Tech talent is quite tight and difficult. I would say some of the companies that have taken a very hard view on working from office has actually opened up our opportunity to acquire talent from whether it's Wall Street firms or the large tech companies."

And quite honestly, the activity we see away is efficiency gains in direct client-to-dealer trading primarily, and it does not involve much all-to-all trading in my opinion. So when you look at the growth in D2D activity away from us, it's largely suites and session-based trading that is pure D2D. I think the exhaust potentially has opportunities to look for liquidity elsewhere. But certainly, what shows up on the TRACE is 100% D2D. Portfolio trading is C2D today without really additional participants in the marketplace. So that is a C2D protocol. And the newer entrant that is getting some media attention and It looks to us like -- and again, this is based on the TRACE and I think all of you have the opportunity to speak with them directly, which, of course, you should do. But based on the analysis of what's available in the TRACE ATS tape, it looks to us like the all protocol is flat year-over-year and all of the growth is coming from dealer direct. And dealer direct is in early stages. It's when we talk to clients, it's the levels that are streamed are not fully executable at those levels. So it almost always involves a negotiation on or off system to get to the point where there's a trade completed. So it's C2D trading with negotiation according to market participants, some of it process, some of it electronics. So when we really think about the 7 years of investment that we've made to focus on all of our protocols and all of our products on open all-to-all trading, we believe that our leadership there is significant, and that benefit will come through when we see higher levels of volatility and price dispersion just as it did in 2020."

If you look at the pure China bond connect volumes currently, you see the international activity levels at somewhere around $6 billion or $7 billion in turnover per day. Now on the one hand, that makes it a large local market already with that volume. On the other hand, that's a very small part, less than 10% of the daily market volume in the Chinese government bond market. And our view shared by others is that, that international ownership will grow because it's highly likely that the Chinese waiting in the government bond indices around the world will continue to go up in the years ahead. So those that are measured by government bond global indices will be increasing their ownership in the Chinese government bond market. So it's an attractive addition today. And in our opinion, it will only grow. Onboarding in OTC markets is time-consuming and complicated as always. So in spite of the fact that we have lots of clients fully integrated to our platform that are ready to trade Chinese government bonds on MarketAxess, there's a documentation and onboarding process that we will go through. So it will probably take us a couple to get to critical mass where most of our clients can take advantage of that new offering."

Operating income was $74 million, and operating margin was 46%. EPS of $1.52 was down 15%, reflecting our ongoing investments in new data, trading and post-trade solutions. Credit market trading faces headwinds currently with a combination of historically low credit spreads and credit spread volatility. These conditions have persisted over the last 3 quarters and history suggests they will revert to the mean over time. Our international business is showing strong growth through volume and market share gains in eurobonds and emerging markets, post-trade services and product expansion. We are pleased to add Chinese government bonds to our offering through China Bond Connect and CIBM Direct. Slide 3 provides an update on market conditions. 
Market volumes have been negatively impacted by the current low levels of bond yields, credit spreads and volatility. During these periods, price dispersion of bids and offers shrinks temporarily. Our liquidity and pricing advantage comes through most clearly at times of normal to high spreads and volatility. And we believe that there are many factors that could positively impact bond volatility in the periods ahead. As yields have started to increase from historically low levels, average years to maturity traded on our system has come down about 6%. Average years to maturity is one of the factors that causes fluctuations in our high-grade fee capture. 
We are watching the emerging news on inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and the China real estate market closely. We believe that it is likely that we will see tapering of Central Bank bond buying in the periods ahead, which is likely to lead to more normalized yield levels and volatility in bond markets around the world. Slide 4 highlights our growth in international markets. In spite of the low levels of yields around the world, we are showing strong growth in our emerging market and eurobond product areas. Eurobond volumes are up 22% year-over-year against the backdrop of lower market volumes. Our estimated market share reached new highs in eurobonds during the quarter. Emerging market volumes were up 19% with estimated market volumes up 1%, reflecting share gains in global EM debt trading. We are seeing strong growth rates in both hard currency EM bonds denominated in dollars, euros and yen, as well as local market trading. 
The addition of China increases our local market coverage to 28 local markets across Latin America, CEMEA and APAC regions. This quarter, we set new records in global active trading clients and international client firms. This expands our broad client network and creates additional cross-selling opportunities. We are underway with client onboarding for China bond connect and expect an active quarter ahead. As the second largest government bond market in the world, China provides a meaningful increase in our total market opportunity.

Open Trading continues to support credit market liquidity by offering all participants the chance to engage with the market. In the third quarter, over 25,000 orders and $13 billion in notional value was available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. Dealers have also realized the benefits of Open Trading and are increasingly seeking anonymous all-to-all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 20% year-over-year to $59 billion during the quarter. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost saving opportunities. Despite compressed credit market spreads, clients faced an estimated $121 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements delivered by Open Trading. The acquisitions of LiquidityEdge and MuniBrokers highlight our investment in new markets and the growing application of Open Trading across the fixed income landscape. $910 billion of U.S. treasury trading volume was executed on market access in the quarter, up 22% from the prior year. 
We have made several enhancements to our rich trading offering in recent months, including our launch of all-to-all Click-To-Trade functionality and extending RFQ trading capabilities for client to dealer orders. The expansion of Open Trading for U.S. treasuries is a critical priority for us and aligns with recent G30 recommendations for an all-to-all marketplace in treasuries. Municipal bond trading on market access grew 92% to $5.4 billion in the quarter. An additional $17.4 billion in volume was conducted through MuniBrokers, our interdealer electronic platform, which we currently do not include in our muni bond volume totals. 
Integration efforts of the MuniBroker platform are well underway, and we are targeting the fourth quarter for the initial phase of our integration of the platform into our Open Trading network. We believe these investments in government bond and municipal bond trading solutions will add approximately 25% to our long-term addressable market opportunity. Slide 6 highlights the growing momentum of automation and credit trading. Automated trading on market access reached new records in the quarter, growing to $42 billion in volume and over 224,000 trades. 
115 firms leveraged our automated trading protocols in the quarter, up from 86 last year. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 7% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform with approximately 4.4 million algo responses in the third quarter, up 17% from the same period last year. The growth of dealer algorithms and our automated trading tools are driving a steady increase in the average number of responses on market access. In the third quarter, we saw an average of 7 responses per inquiry versus 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020. This demonstrates enhancements in our liquidity as a result of the increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. 
Slide 7 demonstrates the growth from diversifying our business initiatives. The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 101% year-over-year. The addition of Continental European clients to our suite of regulatory reporting services through this acquisition has further bolstered our unique data solutions. Through these types of post-trade data sources, we have seen sizable benefits to our data solutions like Axess All and Composite+. Both Axess All and Composite+ helped drive our information services revenue to $9.6 million in the quarter, which is up 13% year-over-year. Combined information services and post-trade revenue now account for 12% of total revenues, up from 8% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Following enhancements to our portfolio trading solution in May, we have seen significant traction with our new functionality. 54 unique investor firms and 13 dealers were active since May and drove record volume of $8.9 billion in the quarter. We believe our active client group is the same group of participants active in the market-wide portfolio trading today. Activity in our session-based protocol, Mid-X, reached record volumes in the quarter of $3.4 billion. We plan on expanding Mid-X beyond eurobonds to U.S. credit later this year. Now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials."

Third quarter revenue was $162 million, down 1% from the prior year. The 5% decline in commissions was offset by the 100% uplift in post-trade revenue. The increase in post-trade revenue includes $3.4 million of trade reporting revenue generated from new clients added through the regulatory reporting hub acquisition. Information Service revenue was up 13% year-over-year due to new data sales and the positive impact of foreign exchange due to the weaker U.S. dollar. The annual contract value for new recurring data contract sales for the first 9 months of 2021 has exceeded all of 2020. 
The sequential pickup in other income was due to foreign currency transaction gains. Excluding regular activity such as foreign exchange gains and losses, we anticipate the quarterly run rate for the other income expense line to be about $1 million of expense. The effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter and 21.6% year-to-date. Slide 9 provides an overview of commission revenue, trading volume and fees per million. The 9% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower U.S. credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture. The 17% decline in U.S. high-grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration driven by the increase in bond yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. 
We also experienced some dealer movement to a fixed fee plan from an all variable fee plan. And this explains the increase in U.S. high-grade distribution fees as fixed fee plans provide for higher fixed distribution fees, but lower transaction fees. Other credit fees per million was lower year-over-year due to a higher mix of emerging market and Eurobond volume that command lower fees. The third quarter 2021 other credit distribution fees includes $1.2 million of MuniBrokers subscription and license fees. Slide 10 provides expense detail. Third quarter expenses were up 16% year-over-year, and include $5.5 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and nonrecurring integration costs associated with the regulatory reporting hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition costs, expenses were up 8.4%. 
The increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher salary and benefit expense as we continue to add employees to support our product and geographical expansion. The $4.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense includes $2.5 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. M&A integration costs and higher recruiting fees contributed to the increase in professional and consulting fees year-over-year. The 32% decline in clearing costs reflect transaction cost savings from our strategic decision to convert to a self-clearing model back in August 2020. We are updating our full year 2021 expense guidance range to $360 million to $365 million down from a range of $370 million to $386 million. The updated expense guidance reflects, among other items, lower incentive compensation and variable clearing costs. Slide 11 provides an update on cash flow and capital management. As of September 30, our cash and investments were $458 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $320 million. 
During the quarter, we paid the $25 million quarterly dividend to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 9,000 shares. During the third quarter, we did not have any borrowings on the 1-year $500 million revolving credit facility for the $200 million secured facility. And on October 15, we replaced the 1-year revolving credit facility with a new 3-year facility. Based on our third quarter results, our Board of Directors approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick."

But we're starting to pilot market conditions index, and I said a year ago on this call that no one should expect the credit trading conditions of last year to continue indefinitely. I will say exactly the same this year from very low levels of volatility that you also shouldn't expect these levels of very low spreads and volatility to continue either. And we certainly, as a more developed business, are impacted by what is going on in the overall market. And you probably saw this quarter that fixed income trading revenue for the large banks was down 15% year-over-year. So they are seeing the same impact from the current market conditions than we are. 
When I turn to competition, I think there are 2 big stories this year. One is the rapid transition of dealer-to-dealer trading from voice-based brokerage to electronic trading. And we see that as our competitors. We also see that quite clearly here with dealers initiating more orders into our Open Trading platform. So that's been one of the themes this year is the dealer-to-dealer business has moved away from some of the traditional voice brokerage firms that is now very actively deployed on the electronic trading networks, including our own. 
It has not historically been one of our big areas of focus, but Open Trading is providing an entry point for D2D training. The second is the growth of portfolio trading, where portfolio trading has grown from something around 2.5% or 3% of TRACE a year ago to around 5% of TRACE now. And the processing benefits for portfolios are significant. So given the large number of line items, electronic processing is critical to the effort. It does not today include new forms of liquidity. It is pure C2D trading. And we are happy to see progress with clients and dealers utilizing our own portfolio trading solution. And I think those are the 2 themes this year on the competitive front that I would point out. And beyond that, I think market conditions have been part of the story, and we're quite confident they will change over time."

I would just also mention that we do see differences in protocols in different environments, particularly protocols that involve derived price protocols. And what I mean by that, if you have a price forming market, they suffer in low-vol and tight spread environments, where you're driving price from the market, things like mid-market sessions. In a low volatility environment, you'll see a gravitation to mid-market sessions or portfolio trading that are using end of price portfolio trades. In a fast market, in a volatile market, those solutions actually will lose market share. So overall, we've seen in the past, both portfolio trading in mid-market sessions get hurt by volatility. They're actually feeling the benefits of the lack of volatility right now."

Rich, you managed to take a 2-question limit and make it a 5-question topic, which is totally fine, but happy to go through all of those. But the short answer on when do the market conditions improve for our business model is we don't know, of course. But what we've done is we've looked at the last dozen years or so, and we pointed out previously, we did have similar conditions in 2014 and 2017. And really 2 quarters was a long time to sit at those low levels of spreads and low levels of credit spread volatility. So we're already beyond that today with the high-grade spread index sitting in a 5 basis point range all of 2021 so far. So history would say that we will see a change. As I mentioned earlier, the ingredients for volatility are clearly increasing. 
Certainly, from my perspective, what we're seeing in wage pressures does not feel transitory nor do some of the increases that we're seeing in energy prices. So there certainly are core parts of the inflation story that I think are longer term in nature. And you still have the central banks, especially in Europe and here in the U.S., buying a lot of the net new issuance of government bonds and even mortgages in the case of the ECB, some corporates. So I would expect that some of the excess liquidity that we have in the market will start to reverse relatively soon because you still have a lot of quantitative easing going on and you have certainly above-trajectory inflation numbers showing up regularly now in the data. So that would be 1 sign, I think, that market conditions are improving. 
On the regulatory front, we see that there is continued talk about greater transparency in fixed income markets, which, of course, we wholeheartedly support. We have no idea why treasury has not moved to increased transparency of the U.S. treasury market given that FINRA now collects the data just as they do for corporate bonds and high yield. So we would be big proponents of increasing transparency in treasuries. We're also continually taking steps to increase transparency in European fixed income, as Chris mentioned earlier, as a byproduct of our growing post-trade reg reporting business. 
So those are very much attached at the hip and we think we're providing a valuable service back to our clients to provide those tools to them. Clearly, Jared Genser has a very busy agenda in front of him. We see topics like crypto and equity market payment for order flow, retail equity trading high on the list, but he does regularly mentioned fixed income transparency and potentially some improvements to the ATS regulatory structure, which we focused on at FIMSAC. And then on China, I'm not sure I perfectly understood the question, but the focus here domestically, of course, is on making sure that public companies that are registered to trade in the U.S. are complying with U.S. accounting and audit rules, which we think makes a lot of sense."

It's really seen a quarter-over-quarter growth rate, particularly in 2021. There are times of volatility where it will grow slower, but it's really based on client adoption and client penetration. And what I mean by that we're really going after the largest investment fund complexes that need automation to solve the multiple tickets and trading that they have on their desk. And so it's really a workflow solution. 
The increased penetration is really increasing the size that clients are comfortable using a no-touch or low-touch solution for trading credit. And we're seeing those increases at the client level. So we continue to see growth. That's why it's achieved. Close to 20% of our trading activity is now through no-touch or low-touch automation solutions. And it's now reached 7% of our total volume. We would expect that to continue to grow as clients continue to seek workflow solutions, particularly in an RFQ environment. There are benefits to Open Trading as a result of the adoption of things like Auto-Responder, which is one of our key automation tools that we rolled out. It's allowing clients to actually participate in responses to other clients or other dealers of requests for price. So that's -- it's having an interesting dynamic to the overall liquidity pool."

It's a good question because there's a lot of industry focus going into 15c2-11 in fixed income right now. And you're absolutely right. This is a 50-year-old rule that was originally designed to prevent fraud in equity OTC markets with retail investors and particularly penny stock. So it's been around for a long time, and it's never really applied to fixed income. And there was a change in the pronouncement of Federal Register from the SEC recently that said that they viewed fixed income as being included in that 50-year rule. And it did come as a surprise because there had not been any staff guidance or really a discussion about the rule previously and no review period before the change came about. 
And I think everybody is trying to sort out exactly what it does mean and the commission did provide a delay of implementation until early next year. And I know it's under discussion and review with market participants and the commission currently. And there are some antiquated terms in there that nobody quite knows how to define currently like what exactly is a quotation medium because it does create restrictions for broker-dealers and publishing quotes on quotation mediums. So the challenge starts with what exactly is the definition of a quotation medium. From our perspective, we have a variety of protocols and the ones that are most actively used by our clients today we do not believe would fall subject to the rule. It's not to say that all protocols would be exempt, but we believe that the ones that are used here primarily would be exempt. 
And the other thing that market participants have gotten comfortable with is that the majority of corporate bonds probably are not going to create an issue, and those are from public companies that are issuing bonds because the deals that broker dealers are required to validate that they have the information for readily available for public companies, some of the private securities 144As and Reg S bonds are still subject to some interpretation, and that's where the area of focus is now. Large market areas like munis and treasuries have been exempted. So I think when all is said and done, we're going to be into a very small sliver of the U.S. market that could be impacted by the rule. And of course, we're hoping that the SEC will respond to some of the industry concerns about really publishing quotes to promote transparency, and in some cases, electronic trading that should be available for all fixed income securities and especially for institutional market participants. So that's what we know about where it stands right now."

Portfolio trading is C2D today without really additional participants in the marketplace. So that is a C2D protocol. And the newer entrant that is getting some media attention, Trumid. It looks to us like -- and again, this is based on the TRACE tape, but I think all of you have the opportunity to speak with them directly, which, of course, you should do. But based on the analysis of what's available in the TRACE ATS tape, it looks to us like the all-to-all protocol is flat year-over-year and all of the growth is coming from Dealer Direct. 
And I -- Dealer Direct is in early stages, right? It's -- when we talk to clients, it's the levels that are streamed are not fully executable at those levels. So it almost always involves a negotiation on or off system to get to the point where there's a trade completed. So it's C2D trading with negotiation according to market participants, some of it process, some of it electronics. So when we really think about the 7 years of investment that we've made to focus on all of our protocols and all of our products on open all-to-all trading, we believe that our leadership there is significant, and that benefit will come through when we see higher levels of volatility and price dispersion just as it did in 2020."

If you look at the pure China Bond Connect volumes currently, you see the international activity levels at somewhere around $6 billion or $7 billion in turnover per day. Now on the one hand, that makes it a large local market already with that volume. On the other hand, that's a very small part, less than 10% of the daily market volume in the Chinese government bond market. And our view shared by others is that, that international ownership will grow because it's highly likely that the Chinese waiting in the government bond indices around the world will continue to go up in the years ahead. 
So those that are measured by government bond global indices will be increasing their ownership in the Chinese government bond market. So it's an attractive addition today. And in our opinion, it will only grow. Onboarding in OTC markets is time-consuming and complicated as always. So in spite of the fact that we have lots of clients fully integrated to our platform that are ready to trade Chinese government bonds on MarketAxess, there is a documentation and onboarding process that we will go through. So it will probably take us a couple of quarters to get to critical mass where most of our clients can take advantage of that new offering."

The high-grade fee capture is -- there's a lot of variable factors that contribute to the month-to-month or year-over-year variability. And as you pointed out, years to maturity, interest rate environment, the dealer fee plan mix, all of those are main contributors. And those 3 items are actually what contributed to the year-over-year increase. And if you had to prioritize it, the #1 factor was the rising interest rate environment. You saw the 10-year treasury spread gap out, which was presented on our Slide 4, the market conditions deck. Rick pointed out there was shorter years to maturity. And I referenced in my prepared remarks that we had a number of dealers migrating from a fixed fee plan -- from a variable fee plan to a fixed fee plan. And all of that collectively, it's probably a 40-30-30 split on the composition of what was contributing to that $35 year-over-year decline."
