Before I turn it over to Brian to kick off the meeting, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second in today's remarks we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings which are posted on our Investor Relations website. With that let's begin the meeting.

We're eager to share our insights on the extraordinary year that just passed, as well as our vision for what's next. But I couldn't start today without reflecting on the fact that 1 year ago at this time the pandemic was just beginning to unfold. And in an effort to keep everyone safe and limit travel, we decided to convert this meeting to a virtual format. While we miss hosting our in person gatherings, it's prudent to stick with virtual presentations once again this year. But we're looking forward to resuming our live events, including this one and our Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2022.
As I look back over the past year, a year when so much care and compassion was called for, I see purpose, coupled with capabilities as the essential enabler of our response. And the story of Target in 2020 is the story of a team that wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us, drawing on capabilities that were equal to that ambition after years of building an investment.  
So I want to start today by publicly recognizing and thanking our team. I'm incredibly proud of the resilience, empathy, care and concern they've shown for each other, our guests and communities through a very challenging 12 months and counting. None of what we'll share today would've happened without them. Even before the dramatic challenges of last year took hold, our team had been busy building the retail platform of tomorrow. But 2020 accelerated everything and, as such, our guests are already benefiting from and loving that platform today. At the heart of the platform was the belief that consumers would continue to flock to out stores for multicategory one-stop shopping; a friendly, well-trained and knowledgeable team; and joyful experiences.
As we designed our strategy and invested accordingly, we relentlessly asked ourselves what products and services those stores should offer, where they should be located, how their operations should be tailored to meet neighborhood needs and ultimately, how to make our stores work together with all of our other assets as one shopping platform that would keep guests turning to Target however they want to shop. In answering those questions, we did 2 things at once: We placed the physical store more firmly at the center of our omnichannel platform and we created a durable, sustainable and scalable business model that puts Target on a road of our own.
Our goal was to use our proximity, nearly 1,900 stores within 10 miles of the vast majority of the U.S. consumers to offer the fastest and easiest digital fulfillment in retail. And the capabilities we built to become America's easiest place to shop also cracked the essential question of how to grow our digital sales exponentially, while maintaining the overall profitability of our business. When we began this journey, we didn't know we would be facing a global pandemic, mass quarantines, rapid unemployment and the need to limit the number of people in public spaces. And yet, when those threats emerged in 2020, we were ready. And without hesitation, millions of American families turned to Target like never before. That happened because of decisions we made 4 and 5 years ago. And today, Christina Hennington, our recently named Chief Growth Officer, along with John Mulligan and Michael Fiddelke, will join me in mapping out how our team's efforts in recent years created a new baseline from which we'll continue to climb higher for our guests.
And here's what I hope you'll take away from our story. First, that our team's ability to act and react in 2020 was years in the making. Without our multiyear roadmap to develop new capabilities and bring them to scale, 2020 could've exposed essential gaps in our business model. Instead, it proved beyond a doubt the durability of our model and it signaled our potential for continued growth in years ahead.
The second takeaway stems from a question I've heard frequently, especially in 2020, ""Brian, what's the secret to Target's growth trajectory?"" What you'll see in our presentation today is that the one thing that's driving our success is a focused commitment to several things: an integrated collection of strategies and capabilities that all work together, are very difficult to replicate and, ultimately, make Target unique.
I'll start today with a high level recap of our full year results. When we gathered virtually for this meeting last year, I shared how our revenue had grown by $5.4 billion since 2017, and that we were consistently gaining share in many of our core merchandising categories. In other words, we were already starting to see steady growth from our investments.
When we left that meeting, no one knew that COVID-19 would be declared a pandemic in the United States, only a couple of weeks later. In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we only receive one COVID-related question that day. But today, as we look back on 2020, the business highlights are clear: Our revenue during the year increased another $15 billion. We gained meaningful market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories, totaling about $9 billion. Our full year comparable sales were up more than 19%, with a store comp of more than 7% in a year when people were staying home to stay safe, and a digital comp of 145%. Standing at this meeting 3 or 4 years ago, it would have been hard for any of us, or any of you, to imagine digital penetration of 18% without a dramatic deterioration in our P&L. Yet today, we announced record high full year adjusted EPS of $9.42. 
Importantly, we accomplished all of this while making huge incremental investments in our team's safety and well-being and completely reoutfitting our stores to keep our team and guests safe. Far for being a fluke, this performance is further proof that we've built a business model that is working as intended, one that puts Target in a category of its own.  
A few consistent pillars have been and will continue to be at the heart of our playbook. The enormous investments we made in supply chain, store operations and technology capabilities are already powering exponential growth in digital commerce. They've enabled us to use our stores and showrooms and service centers, but also as hubs for digital fulfillment. Without these investments, we simply wouldn't have been able to satisfy the exploding guest demand for same-day services, represented by more than 600% growth in Drive Up. 
Likewise, Shipt is an extraordinary capability that grew by more than 300% last year and will continue to grow as more guests recognize the power of having their purchases brought to their doorstep in as little as 1 hour. We have consistently invested in our merchandising strength, like our differentiated owned brand portfolio, our curated national brands, inspired limited time offering and strategic relationships that run the gamut from web only start-ups looking for omnichannel scale to premier partners like Disney, Apple, Levi's and Ulta Beauty.
We're continuously improving our physical and digital shopping experience, investing billions in store remodels, specialized store rows and service training for our teams, while continuing to open up new small formats in urban centers, major college campuses and iconic tourist destinations. Most importantly, we're continuing to invest in our team. Even before 2020's outsized incremental expenditures on team health and safety, Target was an employer of choice, an academy company for those looking for a rewarding and purposeful careers. In addition to accelerating our $15 starting wage in 2020, we celebrated our team's exceptional efforts with 5 separate recognition bonuses, most recently in January when we invested another $200 million to reward each of our frontline team members $500. 
As we develop capabilities, like Target Circle, or acquire them, like Shipt, we do so with a clear vision for how they'll work together in service to our guests. Ultimately, the value they create in our core business has to contribute to our retail offering that's greater than the sum of the parts. But when we look at these elements individually, it's strikingly clear how much value we've added in a very short time. In 2016, our digital transformation was only beginning, we weren't even a top 10 e-commerce provider, and we were just getting our same-day services off the ground. Today, we have the most complete suite of same-day fulfillment services in the industry. We're one of the leading e-commerce players. And for Click and Collect same-day services, we continue to deliver industry-leading growth and dollar volume as well as Net Promoter Scores over 80% despite record demand.
In 2016, we had about 30 small format stores. Today, we have 140 and we'll add another 30 to 40 per year over the next several years. If these stores were standalone chain, they're revenue would rival that of fast-growing chains with many more locations. In 2016, we launched Pillowfort and Cat & Jack, touching off our owned brand reinvention that has since resulted in more than 30 new brands, with more on the way this year. By the time we gathered for this meeting last year, Cat & Jack and 5 other owned brands were generating $1 billion or more apiece in annual sales, and that tally has continued to grow.
We cleared 2020 with 10 of owned brands each generating $1 billion or more and 4 of those across the $2 billion per year threshold. Any one of these brands alone would be a sizable retailer and, as you know, their contribution profits is outsized. Of course, owned and exclusive brands are just one component of our merchandising strategy, which is always run on curated national brands across our assortment.
As we've expanded capabilities in recent years, we've also steadily built our roster of strategic partners. Levi's is an excellent example of how we can build upon a longstanding collaboration and help strategic partners catapult into new product categories. We started partnering with Levi's years ago on the DENIZEN denim brand and that partnership grew to include Levi's Red Tab apparel and build out presence in hundreds of stores and on target.com. Just this last Sunday, we launched the Levi's for Target collection, a limited time offering of home goods. This is the first foray by Levi's into this category and it's a great example of combining their strengths with ours, including our incredible sourcing and product design and development capabilities to forge new potential for both of our brands.
Meanwhile, our team is also gearing up to introduce Ulta Beauty at Target to our stores and target.com, starting with the first 100 stores later this year. From this initial batch, we'll test, we'll learn and we'll expand hundreds of additional locations over time. This partnership combines Ulta Beauty's unparalleled assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty with our large high-growth traffic-driving beauty business and the ease and convenience of our fulfillment services. Together, we'll be able to offer guests access to established, emerging and prestige beauty brands as well as expert beauty consultation in an industry leading omnichannel retail experience.
As a standalone or isolated innovation, each of these elements I mentioned, has something in common with the other. Each was advanced based on how it would complement out other assets and capabilities and we tested each one with an eye towards scale. In fact, the ability to integrate and scale is a key component of our decision making. And to emphasize the critical importance of scalability, I simply think back to what we could've done in 2016 but didn't. At that time, conventional wisdom held that the only way forward was for retailers to build capacity, to send more packages to homes. Instead, we went our own way, built a fulfillment model with our guest local store at the center and took the initiative on same-day. We could just as easily have constructed additional fulfillment centers and driven the shift to digital sales with more ship-to-home capacity. But as you know, the economics were terrible and we wouldn't have been differentiated.
In short, we didn't see the textbook solution as scalable or as likely to do what we've done, namely set the groundwork for years of guest satisfaction and brand loyalty, as represented by comments like this, ""Thank you for providing curbside pickup. It actually was the determining factor in me buying from Target instead of one of those online retailers."" Or this, or this or this note from a guest who simply said, ""Please always continue to do curbside pick up. It is such a help even outside of COVID. This is a wonderful service and I'll continue to choose Target for this very reason.""
So where do we go from here? And how do we keep climbing from this strong new baseline? In the near term, we'll continue to generate incredible value by executing on our strategy. Throughout the pandemic, we've built deep trust and loyalty with our guests who clearly prefer the ease and everyday inspiration of shopping at Target, along with our relentless commitment to the safety and cleanliness of our shopping environment. This is a decades long commitment that was only emphasized by the pandemic, and it will continue to be a differentiator in the months and years ahead.
Our multi-category merchandise portfolio is a huge advantage, particularly as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. And we're absolutely committed to delivering value and everyday affordability, which is important in any environment, but particularly as the economic consequences of COVID continue to play out. At the same time, we'll continue to listen closely to our stakeholders and to build upon our strategy. So in the years ahead, you'll see continuous iteration and improvement in the pillars I've mentioned already. But we'll also focus on better localizing our experience, applying learning from our small format expansion. And we'll continue to build scale and personalizing the experience, leveraging capabilities like Target Circle to better understand our guests and find new ways to engage and reward the 90 million members who have joined so far.
To ensure we're continuously delivering great value and emphasizing everyday affordability, we'll stay laser focused on being priced right daily. And on showcasing our value with clear messaging and relevant promotions. Importantly, we'll also double down on an approach to sustainability that builds on our rich legacy and company purpose. This includes decades of community relations, corporate responsibility and philanthropic leadership grounded in our 75-year track record of giving 5% of pre-tax profits in the support of vibrant and inclusive communities. 
Our intent is to further use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet, building on the work we've done already to elevate our offering of sustainable brands, to create equity and opportunity in our communities and to help protect the environment. High stakeholder expectations for corporate responsibility only increased in the pandemic and the 2020 demonstrations for social justice. And as we've seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation. So this is work that's important, not just to our guests, our team members, our investors and our communities but to ensuring our business model remains durable for years to come.
The best predictor of whether we can follow through on our aspiration is a track record of taking care of our team, serving our guests and communities and responsibly growing our business. And to give you a more detailed picture of how we'll continue to do that in the years ahead, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to weigh in. Christina?"

It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back",1400,"Thanks, Brian. It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back in 2003. Since then, I've held a number of roles across merchandising. Over that time, I've seen a lot in our business, ups and downs, good years and rebuilding years, economic booms and a great recession. But I've never seen anything like last year. Of course, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event, challenging our team and our guests in ways we never could have imagined. But how we responded at Target, empowering our teams, moving quickly and leveraging the power of our multi-category assortment, that's Target at its best. In fact, that's Target better than I've ever seen us. 
So when I think about my new role in bringing together insight, strategy and innovation, plus planning, design, sourcing and buying functions, it's not about fixing anything, it's about improving on what worked so well last year. It's about keeping Target relevant by staying ahead of what our guests need and it's about positioning Target to drive growth in 2021 and for years to come. We were successful last year because we gave our guests a lot of reasons to be confident in shopping at Target. The work of our frontline teams to keep our stores safe and clean has made Target a destination, a happy place as our guests limit other trips out of their homes. 
Our suite of same-day fulfillment options was a game changer, driving triple-digit growth in our digital sales. And regardless of whether our guests were strolling our aisles or scrolling on our app, we struck that balance between replenishment and discovery. Through the breadth of our assortment, along with a single view of inventory and teams leading across all channels, we were able to move with speed and agility, meeting guest needs despite the fastest changing environment we've ever faced. 
A lot of you probably saw this last spring in observing our business or in your own lives. In the space of just a few weeks at the outbreak of the pandemic, guests stocked up on food, beverages and essentials. Then they turned to us for help in converting kitchen tables into classroom space and spare bedrooms into home offices. And then they look to Target for fitness gear, games and other entertainment as they settled in for the long haul. That kind of volatility continued throughout 2020. In fact, one of the only constants last year was that no matter what happened, our guests turned to Target for help to meet functional needs to get through the pandemic and for inspiration and joy, especially around those key seasonal moments that took on added importance for so many people last year. 
So we never looked at our business from the perspective of a particular category. Instead, we shaped our business decisions around what was happening in the world. That's something we'll continue to guide us. Because when we focus on what's happening in the lives of our guests, it's obvious what categories we need to flex to keep building on the trust they placed in Target. Our multi-category assortment is a competitive advantage because it keeps Target relevant no matter what. But how we manage that assortment, the premium we place on curation, partnerships and product design and development, that's what differentiates Target. 
Brian touched briefly on our billion and multibillion-dollar owned brands. Our owned brand portfolio, which spans all categories, is vital to the success of our business. It represents about 1/3 of our total sales and even more of our gross margin, which helps to sustain key enterprise investments. And Target's owned brands continue to generate strong growth because of our approach to creating, designing and maintaining these brands. They're not just private labels, they're brands our guests trust, they're brands our guests love. 
A great example of this is in the athleisure space. Even before athleisure became work-from-home apparel, this was a hot category, and it was an area where we had room to raise our game. So early in 2020, we launched All in Motion. And last month, it became a $1 billion brand. That didn't happen by chance. We were able to respond to this trend quickly and build a beloved brand because we invested in co-creating this brand with our guests. Our team talked to 15,000 people, we consulted with 65 fitness pros and we had team members attend dozens of workout classes with our guests. That's the kind of work we put into owned brands across our assortment in every category. So whether it's sweating through a spin class or talking to parents and kids about how Cat & Jack can meet their needs or taste testing every recipe in our Good & Gather assortment before we launch, we go the extra mile, resulting in brands our guests don't just buy because we offer them at a good price, but instead, brands they love, brands that are the reason why they're shopping at Target in the first place. 
And that work continues. This year, we'll announce and launch several new owned brands in areas where we know Target can make a difference for our guests. This focus on making Target irresistible through our products and our experience also applies to how we work with our national brand partners. And it's an approach that has made targeted place where national brands thrive. You've heard about Levi's, including the limited time Home Collection that just set and the Ulta Beauty at Target shops we're adding to our stores and target.com this year. Those are great examples of what Target represents for our partners. Levi's is an iconic brand that, for a long time, have thrived largely in department store environments. But as they began exploring new platforms, they turned to Target. And Ulta Beauty is an incredible leader in specialty beauty. Through our new partnership, we'll provide access to brands we know our guests love, but previously had to go elsewhere to get. 
This kind of work is a big part of what makes Target special, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, in fact, we began rolling out a dedicated Apple experience, starting in 17 stores across the country and online. We're doubling the Apple footprint in these stores with new lighting fixtures and displays for Apple products, including an extended assortment of accessories. We have a new dedicated Apple landing page on our digital channels and we'll offer our guests more expertise with Apple train team members in these stores and enhanced product videos on our app and website. This is really exciting because we're taking the work we've done with Apple over the last 15 years and making it even better. 
Finally, I want to touch on a body of work that's incredibly important. The efforts underway to make Target more relevant and more welcoming for black guests. Over the last few years, we've listened carefully to our multicultural guests as a whole, and we recognized there was an opportunity to do more for black guests. So we've added more brands and products that we know they love. A great example is what we've done in the beauty space with 50 black-owned and black-founded brands now available in our industry-leading assortment. But we're committed to doing even more in key categories through our owned brands and partnerships, building on our progress to ensure that we're delivering on our purpose of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. 
The retail landscape is never static. So the retailers that will win are the ones that have a durable business model, something we've built at Target. But just as important, the retailers that will be best positioned for the future are the ones with the closest connection to their customers and the ability to flex to meet their changing needs. That was critical to Target's success last year. And that obsession with listening to our guests, understanding the things that are shaping their world and meeting their needs for convenience and ease, inspiration and discovery across all channels is what has Target poised for continued growth in the years ahead. 
Thank you. And now I'll hand the meeting over to John."

While most people expect the operations guy to get right into the technical stuff, like capacity, throughput and automation, and don't worry, I will get there, I'm going to start with our people, the Target t",2124,"Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. While most people expect the operations guy to get right into the technical stuff, like capacity, throughput and automation, and don't worry, I will get there, I'm going to start with our people, the Target team. In a year when the flexibility and scalability of our operation was pressure tested, our team rose to the challenge, just like they always do. They were the connection between processes, technology and physical assets, that allow us to deliver safety, ease, reliability and even a bit of joy during a year of uncertainty for our guests. Of course, the team wasn't starting from scratch. As you heard already this morning, we've been investing in them for years and building capabilities that would set them up to better serve our guests in any time, let alone a global pandemic. 
Let me take you back for a minute to one of our favorite reference points. It was early 2016 and Target's strategy was coming into focus. After years of testing and listening to our guests, we knew that betting on our stores, an uncommon proposition at the time, would be at the heart of a durable and scalable model. And we needed an operation with the right capabilities to drive it. Getting there wouldn't be fast or easy. Quarter-after-quarter, we tested, iterated and learned how to modernize our supply chain, update our stores, use them as fulfillment hubs and train our team to bring every part to life. Then we had to learn how to do it at scale.
In 2019, all these efforts started operating together, and we saw tangible proof through financial results, market share gains and guest satisfaction scores that our work was paying off. Fast forward to 2020, we were ready for the world to change. But only because of the years we'd spent laying the operational foundation. The story of how we navigated the twists and turns of 2020 starts with replenishment because the whole operation relies on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. This last quarter, 95% of all sales, online and in person were fulfilled by our stores, which is why it's critical they have enough of the inventory our guests want to buy. Without that piece, the operation simply stops. When the pandemic hit last spring, our guest shopping behaviors changed nearly overnight. We saw heavy stock up trips, huge in-store surges and then a quick shift to online shopping. To meet the needs of the guests, our supply chain had to turn on a dime.  
We sent hundreds more deliveries than we planned every day to replenish stores fast and often. Flexibility we'd learned from opening dozens of small format stores. We prioritize the flow of essential inventory like paper towels and cleaning wipes, to quickly send stores more of what they needed, not just what was planned. As we sold every paper product we had last March, we expedited everything we could from our vendor partners and secured greater allocations of additional inventory as they ramped up to produce more.
In a normal year, we just spent months preparing for the traditional Q4 shopping spike. But in 2020, our peak season started in March. And after months of moving record volume, we have become increasingly efficient in how we managed high levels of demand. So when the holidays actually did arrive, we leaned into what was already working. We sent more inventory to stores than ever to prepare for an earlier holiday rush. We front-loaded those deliveries with the seasonal merchandise guests would expect so our stores would be stocked and ready, and we continue prioritizing essential products, like cleaning supplies and health care items, so we could keep meeting the pressing needs of our guests.
The flexibility of our supply chain set up our stores to play an essential role in our communities. Because we could restock shelves quickly, guests could count on Target for what they needed, whether they came inside or shopped online. And when our digital business picked up last spring, our fulfillment operation went into high gear. Up to that point, our same-day fulfillment services had already been rolled out nationwide. Millions of guests were loving them because they're fast and easy. We always love them because they're incredibly efficient. Without the shipping expense, these orders look much more like a store sale than a traditional online transaction, costing on average 90% less than if we'd shipped it from a warehouse. And at the start of 2020, our same-day sales were growing at a healthy clip. Come spring, when consumers saw the need for more contactless ways to shop, those services exploded. And we had the infrastructure in place to grow alongside demand. 
Brian gave you the full year highlights on Drive Up, up more than 600%, and even Order Pick Up, which has been around for years, still grew more than 70%.  Beyond our pickup options, the delivery capability we have in Shipt became even more important. It filled the need for guests who wanted an online order, especially for perishable items, but also for so many other essentials across Target, brought right to their front doors. It offered more personalization, reliability and speed than they could get from a packaged shipment. And as a result Shipt's target sales grew more than 300%. Of course, we continue to ship online orders from the back of our local stores, saving 40% of the cost of shipping from a warehouse, an economic advantage for us as digital sales now account for even more of our total revenue.
With third-party carriers fielding historic levels of volume, we worked closely with our partners to plan for capacity constraints and send millions and millions of packages to guest store's steps. But the popularity of our same-day services gave guests another option to shop from home, yet receive their orders faster, reliably and on their own time. Guests had Shipt deliver when it matched their schedule instead of guessing when a shipment would arrive. They drove through our pickup lanes when they were already out and about. No appointment required. This gave guests a flexibility they couldn't find anywhere else. The extraordinary growth of those services has shown just how much guests value that convenience, speed and peace of mind and the comfort they find in having a contactless option.
In fact, we found that what we built to make Target the easiest place to shop had also set us up to be one of the safest. I've said countless times that a benefit of using our stores as hubs is our ability to ramp-up in peak times and ramp back down based on demand. This last year, the stores ramped up and stayed there. In early spring, our stores were fulfilling more in a single day than they had an entire week the year before, day after day after day. At the same time, they were also continuing to support a safe and easy in-store experience, which also drove strong comps. As our digital business continued to pick up steam, our stores sustained that pace for months on end. Records were set and then broken again and again and again.  
But the years we spent building a rock-solid fulfillment capability in our stores prepared us to handle waves of volume without sacrificing the guest experience. Stores knew how to staff for peaks, train other store team members to pitch in when things got busy and adjust storage space to hold more orders. Despite wild growth, our Net Promoter Scores that represent guest satisfaction stayed incredibly high. It's one thing for our teams to adjust to record volume, but it's even more impressive to do it while we enhance the services themselves. As digital demand surged, we simultaneously broadened the assortment to make even more of the store available for same-day fulfillment. We added apparel to Shipt's delivery offerings and tested adult beverage pickup in a handful of markets. Most notably, we added fresh and frozen grocery to Drive Up and Order Pick Up. Although this expansion was already in the plan, we accelerated the rollout to go nationwide this summer, offering even more guests essential groceries through our contactless services. 
Importantly, we also adjusted the process to make our services even safer and more efficient. With Drive Up and Order Pick Up, guests now display a PIN on their phones from a distance or through a car window so teams can securely deliver the right order while staying farther apart. We gave additional store team members back up training and fulfillment. For example, when we temporarily closed our Starbucks cafés, we taught hundreds of baristas how to efficiently pick and pack an order. That allowed us to keep those team members on the schedule and build their skills, while also helping us manage high volumes during peak times. And we added thousands of Drive Up parking spots, so guests could get in and out even faster.
At the same time, Shipt more than doubled its shopper network to increase the number of delivery windows it could offer to keep up with soaring demand. It's worth taking a minute to emphasize that using our stores to support digital demand is only possible because of the trust and collaboration across many teams at Target. It's not just a stores operation or a supply chain effort, it's the product of many teams strategizing around a common purpose to deliver for our guests. That one team mindset is what built the capabilities we have today and is what allowed us to adjust swiftly when the business accelerated unexpectedly. 
We built an operation to handle the healthy digital growth we expected through the middle of this decade. The only surprise was that we got there last year much sooner than planned. Although we designed for that kind of flexibility and scale in the long run, our team hadn't planned for it to come all at once, and that's what makes their outstanding execution with no advanced warning, all the more remarkable. Advancing the business several years in a matter of months prove that our model is scalable and also prove we have the capacity to grow.  
I'd remind you of what I've shared in several of our past earnings calls. A reliable way to assess our stores throughput capacity is to look at the sales we do per square foot. And you can see that productivity has grown a lot over the last couple of years for our average stores, but also for our top quartile. The fact that we continue to see more throughput in our highest-performing stores shows the capacity we have across the rest of the chain for even more growth in the future.
With all the expectations we have for our stores, the physical buildings themselves play a huge role in our strategy. We're as committed as ever to our years long initiative to remodel stores with an inspirational specialty store feel that makes shopping easy and convenient. At the beginning of last year, we'd started about 130 full store remodels. In mid-March, to reduce distractions in our stores, we decided to complete the projects we'd started. Then we pivoted to more targeted improvements that emphasize safety, like installing plexiglass dividers and reformatting our sales floor for greater distancing.
The timing for our small-format stores also shifted. After pausing construction in the spring, our teams accelerated the work through the summer and fall to finalize more than 2 dozen stores for new local guests. Despite stopping the work for part of the year, we still opened 29 small format stores, the most completed in 1 year-to-date. From the Las Vegas Strip to UC San Diego, our first store right on campus property, we tapped into new communities. And we continued expanding across markets like New York and L.A. With each one, Target brought a safe and essential shopping experience to even more guests, while positioning us to serve those neighborhoods for years to come.
Our construction and store design teams also adjusted following the demonstrations for racial justice this summer. One of our Minneapolis stores required an entire rebuild. Without it, the local community had nowhere nearby to get essentials like baby formula and fresh food. So we partnered with local nonprofits to distribute needed supplies while putting plans in motion to reopen fast. We leaned on the expertise we developed remodeling stores and opening small formats to meet the community's needs. We listened to nearby residents, worked with local contractors, personalized the in-store experience and reopened months later as a convenient shopping destination, but also as a better partner to the neighborhood. Take a look.

You saw it in the opening video and you've heard it throughout this morning. Our team is the heartbeat of Target. And even when faced with challenges, they bring their A game. 
Several years ago, we implemented a new operating model in our stores to lift up that drive. It was a shift towards specialized roles to give our teams expertise, empowerment and a sense of ownership in how they serve our guests. With that model in place, our team could quickly adapt to the ups and downs in 2020, execute well and play an essential role in our communities. Now like anything in life, balance is good, and we found opportunities to train our specialists in other areas like teaching a hardlines expert how to fulfill an online order. So they gain skills beyond their specialized position. Those investments in their development also add flexibility to our operation.
We've always known that supporting our team would have great returns and it has. In addition to the bonuses, time off options, wellbeing benefits and expanded nationwide starting wage that Brian mentioned, we also gave our team even more hours. With a greater investment in our trained and expert workforce, we saw turnover drop and guest satisfaction rise. It's a strong testament to what can be done when we empower our teams to use their skills and passions to serve our guests. The bottom line is that as our business grew exponentially, our operation flexed alongside. And as we delivered for our guests, we built on the trust they put in us to meet their needs and make it easy.  
Going forward, we're taking the capabilities that drove Target in 2020 and accelerating them to continue making Target, the safest and easiest place to shop. As we do, we'll invest in more capacity and greater efficiencies. So we're positioned to continue growing for the long term.
In our supply chain, that starts with expanding our network so we continue to have replenishment capacity that can support our future growth. In recent years, we accommodated steady sales growth through our existing supply chain network by increasing the productivity of our buildings. In fact, the average sales per foot supported by our distribution centers rose nearly 30% between 2016 and 2020, thanks to a series of process and technology improvements. During those years, we didn't open any new DCs to support replenishment. But after our business grew nearly 20% last year, with 95% of sales driven by our stores, it's time to expand our supply chain so we can support a much higher base of sales and continue growing.
This year, we'll open 2 distribution centers to support replenishment, 1 close to the New Jersey Delaware state line and another in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. And we currently have plans for one on each coast in 2022. We're also continuing to simplify the unload process once product reaches the stores. In a nutshell, it all comes down to how we sort and organize millions of items before they arrive at the stores' loading dock.  
We've shown you the robotics capabilities we're building to help us sort inventory to the precise amount of store needs and organize it by store aisle. When we do, replenishment in stores is fast. Team members grab a tote, walk to the aisle and stock the shelf. No sorting in the back room or finding places to stash cases of excess product. We have 2 solutions that help us do that. We showed you both of these independently last year: 1 called auto-rebin sorts individual items. This is most useful for slower moving inventory, when stores only need a handful of items to put back on the shelf. Auto-rebin started in one of our local Minnesota warehouses, rolled out to 2 more and we'll expand to another 2 this year. 
The second is the robotic ships order we've been building at our Perth Amboy facility. This sorts everything, from boxes of individual items to entire cases of product. After the sort, robot sequence inventory so our team can load pallets in an order that saves stores even more time. Individually, these capabilities are hugely valuable, but they're designed to work together. This spring, we'll put both solutions in 1 warehouse to test how they bring more precision and speed to store replenishment. In Q4, we'll run them together at a small scale, doing what we always do to learn and iterate before we go bigger. Opening new warehouses and expanding our robotics capabilities are both about moving product more easily to stores. 
But just as important is being ready to send what stores need before they even know it. This year, we'll continue expanding the rollout of our predictive inventory positioning capability across our assortment. This helps us more precisely order and position product close to where we anticipate guests will want it so we can react quickly when there's demand. In turn, it improves out of stocks and lowers backroom inventory levels. In 2020, when sales spiked, this capability allowed us to order and restock products 25% faster than using our old systems. This year, we'll use it to order and position even more items in our assortment, so we can replenish the majority of the store faster for our guests. 
We've talked about how store replenishment feeds store fulfillment. This past year, our team was able to keep filling online orders because our supply chain was replenishing that inventory with speed and precision. While we continue refining our replenishment operation, we'll also build on our fulfillment capabilities to enhance the guest experience and make way for future growth. Today, the majority of our store assortment is available through our same-day services, but we're continually working to give guests even more choices. In coming months, we'll expand our pickup options further into categories like apparel and fresh food and roll adult beverage pickup to 800 more stores.
We're also continuing to improve the Target Run so it's even easier for our guests and faster for our team. For example, Drive Up guests will be able to share more preferences in the app, like telling the team where to place the order in their vehicle or signing an alternate pickup person so it's easier for a spouse or family member to pick it up. We're numbering our Drive Up spaces so our teams can find guests sooner for those times when a guest pulls up in a black SUV next to 8 other black SUVs. And we're updating the team member app, so they can more easily see what orders are in progress and where they can help.
Our same-day services have grown faster than any other fulfillment method. But when we do ship online orders, we'll continue sending the majority of those packages out the back of our stores. Since 2016, we scaled our ship-from-store capability from a low tech test in a few hundred stores to a sophisticated fulfillment operation in most Target backrooms. Now before anyone gets too worked up, I don't mean we have robots hiding in the back. Instead, we've got efficient tools, technology and process design working together, continually increasing the number of orders a store can fulfill.
Next, we'll take it a step further, developing last mile capabilities that help us continue scaling this operation so we can ship more orders from stores on even lower cost. To do it, we're testing a new type of facility here in Minneapolis called a sortation center. The idea is to make our stores' hub model even more efficient, while also reducing our load on external carriers. Take a look.

In the end, it allows us to get orders to guests faster and at a lower cost. While we're still ramping up production at this first test facility, we're very confident in this concept and plan to open 5 additional sites in other urban markets later this year.
In 2021, we'll also open more stores, accelerating our growth with 30 to 40 new locations a year, a pace we'll keep up for the foreseeable future. With our small format strategy, we'll expand in urban markets like Portland, L.A. and New York City, where there are still opportunities to serve new guests. And we'll continue our focus on college stores with the University of Georgia and the University of Michigan planned for later this year. We remain extremely bullish on our college sites. Even as the pandemic sent students to online classrooms and sales softened at many of those stores, we see them as a long-term play to serve the college guests, many of whom are on the brink of adulthood and building lifelong shopping habits.
We'll also open a number of midsized stores to serve dense suburban neighborhoods from Denver to Brooklyn. As hundreds of retail vacancies have left holes in communities across the country, we've committed to sites where we can fill a need for the local guests. And as retail real estate prices have declined this year, we found these opportunities to serve new communities to be even more affordable. Along with opening new stores, we'll get back to remodeling our existing fleet. After stopping our full store remodels last spring, we'll pick back up later this year and complete about 150 stores in time for holiday, and we'll plan to ramp up to more than 200 stores a year in 2022 and beyond. 
Safety and ease have become the heart of Target shopping experience, and we'll incorporate what we learned during 2020 into our future store design. That includes implementing more contactless features, from our restrooms to our checkouts and adding distance between merchandise and at the check lanes. And as you heard from Christina, we'll also bring brand partnerships to life in our stores throughout 2021. A great example is the work we'll do to add Ulta Beauty to our sales floor, creating a specialty environment that's seamlessly integrated into the Target experience. Similarly, we'll use store design elements to highlight additional brands like Disney and Apple for our guests. 
We're investing in a lot of really exciting developments to fuel Target's growth. But what they all have in common, they're giving our team the tools or the backdrop to take better care of our guests and each other. That shows up most in our stores where the vast majority of our 350,000 team members bring our brand to life for guests across the country. A huge priority for our stores this year is adjusting our staffing strategies to create more predictability for our team. That's a challenge in any retail job, where ours are based on dynamic factors like consumer shopping patterns and changing team needs. But we know having an engaged team with more consistent hours leads to higher productivity, greater efficiency and lower turnover. It creates a place where people join to learn a job and stay to build a career and better serve our guests in the long run. So we'll train team members to take on other roles across the store and offer the option for longer shifts.
We'll also build on our stores' operating model by introducing a new standard of service to our teams. It's not a checklist, but a set of principles that define great service, like welcoming a guest and paying attention to what they need, which might be as simple as finding an item or as big as building an outfit. It's meant to give our team flexibility and empower them to do what's right for the guests in the moment. Without our team, everything else you heard today comes to a standstill. The Target team continues to be the most important part of our operation, and I want to say an enormous thank you to all our team members for all they do to serve our guests and our communities.
You've seen us make a lot of operational investments over the last few years, in our team, in our stores and in our capacity for long-term growth. In the most recent quarter, those returns were clear. We've created an operation unlike anyone else with our physical assets working together, centered on our stores and fueled by our team to serve our guests and grow for the long term. The capabilities we built not only allowed us to navigate the most volatile time in retail history but show that they can flex and grow to serve the ever-changing needs of the consumer. The work isn't done. We're constantly refining an operation that is efficient, fast and supportive of Target's durable and scalable business model. From an engineer by training and a finance guy at heart, I can attest that you can't get too efficient or relevant enough. There's no finish line for continuous improvement and innovation. We'll keep making bets on the capabilities that give us the flexibility to serve guests well into the future.
We have a lot of strength heading into 2021 and a lot of work still in front of us. But with a sound operational foundation and the talent and resilience of the Target team driving us ahead, I look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters and years to come.  
With that, Michael, I'll hand it over to you.

Those news clips paint a vivid picture of the roller coaster our team and our business experienced throughout 2020. All in all, it was a standout year in which everything we've spent years developing and building came together to serve our guests like never before. 
So today, after a year of record growth, I want to start my remarks by expanding on a point Brian mentioned earlier because investors often want to know, how much of Target's growth is being driven by specific strategies or specific assets? For example, they want to know if we can isolate how much of our growth is coming from Drive Up, from digital and total, our owned brand work, remodel program and any other way we can slice and dice the data. And I understand the impulse. Our internal team often wants to do the same thing. And of course, as a self described data geek, I'm inclined to think the same way.
But then I see data like we first shared with you last year. Guests who tried Drive Up for the first time spend about 30% more on average compared with before, including an increase in conventional store shopping. And we see a similar change in behavior among guests who try Shipt for the first time. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of Drive Up and Shipt go far beyond the value of an individual trip. They're both capabilities that drive guest affinity, creating value that extends well beyond the services themselves.
That same thinking applies to our merchandise categories. If you focus only on the amount of sales or growth by category, you can miss how they all work together to drive guest affinity. I see how this plays out with my own family. Over the next few months, the cold weather in Minnesota will finally end, and my kids will need warm weather clothes. On the next Saturday morning Target run, we'll shop for those clothes, and we'll also pick up some food, a few office supplies, laundry detergent and maybe a prescription from CVS. We might wander over and purchase some spring decor. And we'll probably need some more earbuds since the kids seem to be inventing new ways to lose or destroy them. And on our way out, we'll probably stop at the Starbucks near the entrance so my wife and I can enjoy a coffee on the way home. 
So now if you're going to analyze that basket, is there a way to know which category drove the trip? And beyond the basket itself, shouldn't we broaden the analysis even further since that trip depended on a conveniently located store that's clean, safe and fun to shop, featuring low everyday prices and a friendly and engaged team?
Over time, I've come to understand that guest engagement and financial performance are driven by everything we're doing at the same time, not any factor in isolation. Among the critical factors, of course, there are the tangible assets that show up on our balance sheet, including our stores, distribution centers and technology, but the list goes way beyond the balance sheet and includes our team, our reputation and the trust we've established with multiple stakeholders, which only deepened in 2020. Then there's the Target brand itself. Our owned and exclusive brands, capabilities like marketing, merchandising, product design and development, sourcing and so much more. And of course, there's our culture, our mission and our values, which helped to unify a diverse and widely dispersed team in support of a common purpose. 
So what's the key to our future performance? It's our continued investments in the assets and capabilities, both tangible and intangible, that we can build and integrate to drive guest engagement and growth. And how should we determine what to focus on? The answer comes from continually listening carefully to our guests. The better we know them, the more effectively we can invest in what they want and develop new ways to deliver joy and inspiration while making their lives easier. If we invest the right way, guests will reward us with more engagement and growth, which in turn will create additional opportunities to invest.  
Our success in 2020, which was years in the making, is a perfect example. It started many years ago as we engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of our business, our strategy and took a deep dive into the wants and needs of our guests. That work led to a new strategic focus, followed by years of investment of both capital and expense to roll out new fulfillment capabilities, rejuvenated stores and brands, a modern store operating model and more. Through that work, we built the foundation that allowed our team to deliver unprecedented results in the face of a rapidly changing landscape in 2020.  
So this year, our focus is to lock in last year's gains, build on that foundation, continue to deepen guest engagement and drive long-term growth. And following last year's growth of $15 billion, more than we grew over the prior 11 years combined, we're entering 2021 as a much larger company with a host of opportunities to build on last year's success.  
Digital is one of those opportunities. As John mentioned, in 2020, the penetration of digital sales advanced many years in a single year. With COVID as the catalyst, guests who had never tried our digital services quickly changed their habits and tried them sooner than they would have otherwise. We've long told you that, on average, a multichannel guest spends nearly 4x as much as a store-only guest and nearly 10x more than a digital-only guest. Now just in case there are any stats majors listening, that's a statement about correlation, not causation. So I'm not saying that a guest spending immediately changes that much after they move into a new channel. 
Even so, these averages help us to understand how deepening engagement translates to a more valuable guest relationship. And last year, Target gained an additional 12 million multichannel guests. Of course, a portion of those guests were completely new to Target, but the vast majority had previously shopped with us, but only in a single channel. The opportunity this year is to build on our now deeper relationship with these guests as we engage with them more frequently and help them migrate toward the much higher average spend we see from our multichannel guests over time.
And today, even though we already have an unmatched suite of digital fulfillment options, there's more we can do for our guests. One way is to continue expanding the assortment of fresh, refrigerated and frozen food items available for Pick Up and Drive Up. When we study the behavior of guests who first shopped for these items through one of these services last year, we saw an average increase in shopping frequency of about 1 visit per month compared with the control group. On average, these guests increase their food and beverage spending between 20% and 30%. And importantly, spend about 20% more in other categories. 
As you heard from Christina, we also have an opportunity to continue developing and launching new owned brands while we become an increasingly attractive partner for leading national brands. In the years ahead, we'll likely have many more partnership opportunities. And given our strong performance and financial position, can be very thoughtful in approaching every one of them. This begins by ensuring the partnership is right for our guests and that the partner and financial arrangement are appropriate long-term choices for our business. 
And of course, there's a huge opportunity to create value through Target Circle, which has grown in less than 2 years to include more than 90 million members. Circle is easy and free to join and members enjoy rewards that drive engagement directly, which we can measure by the increase in spending among guests who joined. But the value of Circle only begins there because it also helps us to gain an ongoing, deeper understanding of our guests and their changing preferences, helping us to connect them with the services, brands and categories that address those wants and needs.
So it's clear that we're entering 2021 with a lot of momentum and a really strong foundation with a lot more room to grow. As you heard from John, we still have a long runway to expand the available assortment for our same-day services, while we invest to broaden Shipt's reach by entering new markets while expanding in existing ones. When we acquired Shipt in late 2017, we were confident that same-day delivery was a capability every successful retailer would need to have, and we've spent the last 3 years integrating Shipt into our strategy and operations. At the same time, the acquisition has made it easier for Shipt to grow and achieve scale in new markets, given the volume that Target immediately brings to the platform. 
And as John covered, we're investing to modernize our network and add replenishment capacity to support future growth. Obviously, we came into last year with a great deal of capacity, but we used up a lot more of it than expected. Here's one way to think about it. At our current average sales per store, last year's growth of $15 billion was equivalent to the addition of more than 300 new Target stores. If we had actually opened that many new locations, we'd have needed some additional upstream capacity, and that need is the same, whether growth is coming from a bigger store footprint or higher productivity in our existing footage.
While I'm on the topic, I want to pause and address the question of whether our stores are going to run out of capacity to grow digital sales. And I'd start with what John mentioned earlier, how our top quartile of stores demonstrate the continued potential for our average stores to handle more throughput. But I want to drill down into a really specific example to provide another view of our untapped capacity. And what we can do when an individual location reaches its limit. To do that, I'm going to go way back in history and talk about our experience at the Target store in Colma, California, part of the San Francisco market.  
20 years ago, Colma had grown to be our second highest volume store in the chain, generating more than $90 million in annual sales, nearly 3x our chain average at the time. Given its extreme volume, we suspected the store was running out of capacity, which was limiting its ability to grow. So when the site of a former Montgomery Ward's became available just across the highway in Daly City, we decided to buy it and build a new Target. This was unheard of in our history, building a new store less than a mile away from an existing one, and it was a calculated risk because the new store would only make sense if it drove incremental volume. And that's exactly what happened. The combined sales of the 2 stores quickly grew far beyond what the single store was able to generate. And today, each of those locations is in the top 5% of our stores based on sales volume.
So let's come back to today. Last year, our stores fulfilled more than 95% of our total sales, which works out to an average of about $47 million in fulfilled sales per store. That means our average store today is fulfilling about half of what the Colma store was already supporting 20 years ago. This offers another clear window into the growth potential of our average store today. But will there sometimes be extreme examples of stores that hit their capacity? I hope so because we know what to do when that happens. If we have a viable real estate opportunity nearby, we can invest in another one of these modern multichannel assets we happen to call a Target store. To be clear, based on what we see today, we don't expect a lot of these opportunities over the next few years, but I'd love to be wrong about that since we'd likely generate strong returns on the new stores we could open in those markets. In the meantime, we continue to make productive investments in new small format stores, and we're eager to begin ramping up our remodel program in 2021 and beyond. 
So with all these options to generate profitable growth, we're in a position to play offense and lean into the opportunity to build on last year's momentum. As such, we're planning for annual CapEx in the $4 billion range in each of the next few years to support remodels, new stores and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network, including sortation centers. Beyond full store remodels, we'll also invest in Ulta Beauty shop in shops, while optimizing front end space in our highest volume locations, increasing the efficiency of our Pick Up and Drive Up services.
So now this is the section of my remarks in which you typically expect me to cover our P&L expectations for the year. But today, given the high level of uncertainty we continue to face, providing a lot of guidance would be an exercise on false precision. Instead, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the most important factors affecting our near-term plans as we maintain our laser focus on investing for the long term.
So first, as I think about implications for Target's top line in the months and years ahead, I think about the drivers at 3 levels of a funnel. At the widest part of the funnel are macro factors, including uncertainty about the path of COVID-19 and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine campaign. How consumer attitudes and behaviors will evolve as we emerge from the pandemic. For example, there's an emerging consensus that the nature of work will permanently change as employers move to a more flexible model and allow for more work from home. This will likely have long-lasting implications for consumer spending. And finally, beyond changes in the consumer mindset, macro considerations include the health of the economy, the near-term impact of stimulus and how quickly various industries and communities will recover from the pandemic. 
The middle stage of the funnel involves questions around potential industry trends in each of the categories we sell and every industry has its own story. And categories consumed mostly at home, including food and beverage, essentials, home and hardlines, industry trends have accelerated over the last year and could see some softness as we emerge from the crisis. However, the timing and extent is hard to predict and could be offset by permanent changes in consumer habits, including a higher percentage of work time spent at home and an elevated focus on cleanliness and health resulting from the pandemic.
In the beauty and apparel industries, which experienced softness in 2020, trends are expected to improve over time. Specifically, as people resume working in offices, attending concerts, movies and sporting events, traveling and eating out, they're likely to focus more on their appearance and spend more on these categories than they did in 2020. But let's be clear. These are just quick high-level thoughts on potential industry trends and they're far from ironclad predictions. 
So as we move to the bottom of the funnel and think about how those trends are likely to play out at Target, we first need to think about market share within those industries and on the topic of share, we have a lot of confidence as we look ahead. In 2020, Target saw unprecedented share gains across all 5 of our core merchandise categories. Importantly, these gains were not limited to the categories in which others were forced to close, and they stayed remarkably consistent throughout the year and across the country. Based on this experience and our investment focus going forward, we're optimistic about our opportunity to lock in recent share gains and deliver long-term growth on top of the foundation we've already established.
So now I want to move beyond the top line and illustrate how we're thinking about other lines on the P&L for the year. And in this discussion, beyond prior year comparisons, I will often be looking back to 2019, since that year provides a more stable baseline compared with the extreme volatility we encountered in 2020. Let's start with our gross margin line, where in 2020, we experienced large but offsetting variances related to specific factors. The first was supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure last year. While that headwind was notable, it was less than I believe most of us would have expected, given that we saw $10 billion of digital sales growth, accounting for 2/3 of our total growth. As we look ahead to this year and beyond, we expect to see a smaller amount of pressure from supply chain and digital fulfillment, given that digital growth is likely to moderate, and we continue to make progress in reducing average unit fulfillment costs. 
A second headwind to last year's gross margin rate was category mix as lower margin categories grew faster than our higher-margin categories, accounting for about 90 basis points of rate pressure. At a minimum this year, we expect category mix to exert less pressure than last year. And notably, it could easily become a tailwind like it was in prior years. However, our crystal ball is not nearly clear enough today to predict this year's category mix with any precision.
The third factor in last year's gross margin performance was our merchandising decisions, which include our pricing, mix of owned and national brands and the magnitude of our promotional and clearance markdowns. In 2020, the combination of these factors provided a significant tailwind of about 150 basis points, driven primarily by favorability and markdowns. A portion of this favorability was related to promotions, but the biggest single factor was a significant decline in clearance markdown rates as demand in seasonal and other clearance sensitive categories far outpaced our expectations. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from these abnormally low levels, which will create some gross margin pressure compared with 2020. So how do these expectations come together in 2021? As we consider the range of expectations for the combined impact of these 3 drivers, we believe that our 2021 gross margin rate will remain somewhat lower than our 2019 gross margin rate of 28.9%.
On the SG&A expense line this year, we'll be annualizing last year's significant investments in safety measures and team member pay and benefits. We'll also be annualizing the fixed cost and other scale benefits we realized throughout the year. Looking ahead, given that we're focused on locking in last year's gains, we expect to retain significant scale benefits compared with 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver continued efficiency improvements, driven by investments in our supply chain, technology and operating model, which will help to offset continued investments in our team. Altogether, we expect that our 2021 SG&A expense rate will also be lower than our 2019 rate of 20.8%. 
On the D&A expense line, we expect to see moderate dollar growth in 2021 as we ramp up remodels and accelerate depreciation on the assets we replace. Of course, rate performance will depend on the total sales we deliver this year.  
So as we consider how all of these rates come together on the operating margin line, we're facing a wide range of possibilities as we enter the year. I've already talked about the unpredictability of sales and how category and channel mix alone can impact our margin. But even with that uncertainty, we should continue to benefit from the leverage we gained in 2020. Altogether, our expectation is that this year's operating margin rate will move down from the 7% we recorded in 2020 but remain above our 2019 operating margin rate of 6%, with the most likely outcome in the lower half of that range. 
So now for those of you hoping we provide a more precise view of our expectations today, I want you to know that I feel the same way. I know that it's difficult to model our business right now. Our team is facing the same challenge. In the face of this uncertainty, we continue to put a huge premium on flexibility and agility, which served us extremely well throughout 2020. After all, flexibility is a cornerstone of our business model, which features a uniquely diverse category mix and a store-based fulfillment model that can quickly adapt to changes in guest shopping patterns. With the benefit of this model, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, we're perfectly positioned to navigate any near term uncertainty, while we continue to invest in long-term growth. And while it may sound counterintuitive, our expectations for the next few quarters feel cloudier than our view of the longer term, when we're highly confident in our ability to grow profitably and build on recent share gains.
So now before I move beyond the P&L, I want to spend a minute talking about the prior year comparisons we're facing in the first 2 quarters of this year. As you'll recall, in the first quarter last year, sales accelerated meaningfully after the onset of COVID, but our gross margin rate for the quarter declined an astounding amount, more than 4 percentage points in light of the cost to rightsize our apparel inventory.
Also in the first quarter, we began making meaningful investments in the health and safety of our team and guests, which we'd maintained throughout the year. Altogether, our first quarter earnings per share were down more than 60% compared with 2019. Contrast that with the second quarter last year when our comp sales grew more than 24%, our gross margin rate also increased and we saw a jaw dropping amount of leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines, which more than offset investments in team and guest safety. As a result, last year's second quarter EPS grew more than 80% compared with 2019. That's a swing of more than 140 percentage points in our EPS growth rates between Q1 and Q2 last year.
So as we plan and analyze our performance in the first 2 quarters of 2021, we're going to lean heavily on comparisons to the much more stable environment we experienced in 2019. This will help all of us to look through the extreme volatility and year-over-year comparisons we'll be seeing throughout the first half of this year. 
So now let's move beyond the P&L and turn to cash and capital deployment, and I want to reiterate that our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. First, we look to invest in the business and all of the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. One note, if we attain that goal in 2021, it will mark our 50th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend increases, putting us in a very small group of companies who can make that statement. And finally, we look to deploy excess cash through share repurchases only after we fully supported the first 2 goals within the capacity of our middle A credit ratings.
As you know, last year turned out to be a very strong year for cash flow in light of our sales growth and strong operational performance. As a result, we ended the year with about $8.5 billion of cash, well beyond the amount we'd maintain in ordinary times. But as strong as our year turned out to be, we can't forget the volatility we just encountered and the environment today remains far from ordinary. It's in that context that we evaluate our 2021 capital deployment expectations.
Regarding CapEx, I already outlined our plan to invest about $4 billion this year. Regarding the dividend, later this year, we expect to recommend that our Board approve a robust increase in the per share dividend. But as always, this recommendation will depend on how our business is performing. Beyond those priorities, we've resumed share repurchases this year. And depending on how the virus, the economy and our performance progresses, could have ample capacity within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.
But I will quickly say, we'll continue to be cautious and maintain an ample amount of liquidity to carry us through a wide range of near-term scenarios. As such, it may be a multiyear journey before our credit metrics move fully back to historical levels, depending on the speed with which we see more normal volatility across the economy and our business.
So now I want to turn to our after-tax ROIC. As we've long emphasized, we rely on this metric to assess the health of our business and the effectiveness of our capital deployment over time. However, as is often the case, we sometimes need to look past near-term volatility and 2020 presents a great example. That's because last year, we delivered an astounding aftertax ROIC of 23.5%, up more than 7 percentage points from already strong performance in 2019. While this outcome is remarkable and a testament to our team and operating model, I'm going to quickly say that it's artificially high and likely to come back down over time. That might sound like a strange thing to say, but it's based on a number of factors that are clear today. 
First, with unexpectedly strong sales, our inventory turns shot up last year, and we saw abnormally high payables leverage. While that had a positive near-term impact on working capital, we also saw really choppy in stocks, which isn't how we want to operate under normal conditions. In 2021, we're planning for full shelves and better in stocks, which will bring inventory turns and payables leverage back down to more sustainable levels. This will require a net investment of working capital for the year. 
Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we're leaning in to support a strong set of growth opportunities over the next few years. As we accelerate investment in stores, supply chain modernization and replenishment capacity in support of those growth prospects, we'll likely see an increase in the invested capital portion of this metric over the next few years. Bottom line, while I believe this metric will stay very healthy and compare favorably to other retailers, I expect it will move back down into the 20% range over time. This would represent very strong absolute and relative performance on a larger asset base than we've maintained in the past. 
So as I get ready to turn things back over to Brian. I want to take you back to this meeting 4 years ago, when I was listening from my headquarters in Minneapolis. During my career at Target, I've been lucky to spend time working with our stores, and I've developed a deep appreciation for the value they can deliver. So when Brian and John stood up and said we'd be investing to put our stores at the center of everything we do, including both digital and physical shopping, I had a ton of confidence in that plan. It was a plan based on carefully listening to our guests, it was differentiated and we were fortunate to have the necessary resources to get there.
In the years following that meeting, our team worked hard, and we encountered many doubters but we continued to invest with a long view and last year's results showed the value of that focus. And as we sit here today, we remain committed to making future investments with that same long view. Rather than sitting back, taking a break and waiting for the virus to subside, we are focused on playing offense and investing in continued growth. 
And just like 4 years ago, my confidence in the future starts with the team. So I want to acknowledge everyone on the Target team, from headquarters to our distribution centers, to our stores in all 50 states and our offices around the world for their dedication to our guests and passion for taking care of each other. Without you, we couldn't have delivered such an amazing amount of value on behalf of our stakeholders in 2020. And with your help, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead. I can't say it enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks."

As we wind down today's event, I'll leave you with a couple of thoughts. 5 years ago, we envisioned a future for ourselves, in which the key to guest preference and breakout growth lay in an unappreciated omnichannel asset called the store. Many were skeptical, which is why we said from the beginning that we were playing our own game and creating a category of one. Many thought the inevitable drift was for our store guests to become digital guests, and that the current only ran in 1 direction.
We saw something different. We saw a future in which even the most committed digital-only guests would find the best and easiest shopping experience at Target because of how we connect that experience to our stores. We knew that to make our stores function for the future that we envisioned, we'd have to build, acquire and bundle a unique set of capabilities. The technology, the supply chain inventiveness, the physical assets and operations and the team of trusted neighbors that millions turn to for friendly service and a bit of everyday joy.  
We began to put all those pieces together like no one else had. And the experience was taking hold, on the timetable we expected. Then 2020 accelerated everything. And today, Target is as synonymous with same-day and safety as it is with style and swagger. That is a very strong position to be in.
And here's where we intend to go with it. First, we'll continue to focus on market share over the long term. We believe our experience, including our fulfillment options, inspiring assortment, ease, safety and personal service will convert more and more consumers into guests. And we'll also work tirelessly to engage established guests across more of our channels and offerings. With new guests choosing Target and established guests engaging with more of our platform, we'll be able to listen to them even more closely. And capabilities like Drive Up, Shipt and Circle will give us a wider window than ever into their preferences. Meaning, we can further improve the experience we provide in the near term, while continuously anticipating where we should go next.  
Staying closely connected to our guests always points us in the right direction. That's what helped us see a future 5 years ago, that today is a reality. And it's why we're stepping up our investments to drive additional profitable growth. Unlike in recent years, when we needed to shore up our foundation or create new capabilities, today's investments will build on an omnichannel Target platform that is already working incredibly well. A platform that has raised expectations, not just among Target guests, but for consumers across U.S. retail. Few can meet those expectations like we can because what we've created is based on a unique combination of differentiated assets.  
But this is just the beginning of our story on which we'll continue to iterate, innovate and continuously improve for our guests. So in closing, I want to express my complete confidence in this company's future. I'm confident in our strategy and in our capabilities. And above all, I'm confident in our team. They know that no platform succeeds without purpose. And that our ambitions are always informed by the millions of families we serve. The results we're sharing today and what we envision for the future simply wouldn't be possible without the best team in the business. And I want to thank them once again for all they do for Target, our guests and communities.
Finally, I want to thank you for joining our Financial Community Meeting. We appreciate your interest in Target, your engagement in our journey and your long-term investment in a growth horizon that we believe will remain bright for years to come. We look forward to hearing from you in the Q&A portion of our program.

We know our guests are inspired by shopping in our stores. They enjoy browsing. They enjoy seeing the combination of our owned brands and national brands. 
And now I think we just punctuate that further with the addition of brands like Ulta Beauty, Levi's, the expansion of Apple. The work that we've done throughout the year to create a showcase of owned brands and national brands and continue to invest in building a trusted and safe shopping experience. So as we think to the future, stores are going to play a very important role. It's going to be a place where our guests enjoy shopping each and every day.

But as we sit here today, I think we all recognize this is a very uncertain environment. We're still speculating around what's going to happen with the economy, how employment rates start to recover. While the trends are encouraging right now with the virus, we're all battling COVID each and every day. And while vaccine distribution is accelerating, millions and millions of Americans are still waiting for their turn to get that vaccine. We're still wondering when children go back to school. And when we'll return to the workplace. 
So we approach guidance, recognizing there's lots of uncertainty. But I'll go back to the fact that for most of the last year, we haven't provided guidance, but we have focused on execution. And I think our team has proven to be very flexible, very agile. We responded to the environment and we've been focused on delivering a trusted and safe experience for our guests, whether they're shopping in our stores or online. That focus on execution will continue in 2021. And I wouldn't confuse guidance or the lack thereof with our confidence to continue to take market share and outperform in the coming months and years.
So I recognize the frustration of not being more precise, particularly on the top line as we think about sales, but I can guarantee you, our entire leadership team and every part of this organization is focused on retaining and growing market share no matter what the variables are we have to face. So I recognize, and we certainly like to be in a different position today, providing more precision. But what I can tell you is we're going to continue to execute our strategy, leverage our capabilities, our owned brands and national brands, our multi-category assortment and our team to continue to build on the momentum we gained in 2020, leverage the additional $15 billion of revenue we now have inside of our P&L and continue to build on the market share we gained in 2020 and make sure that's very sticky for years to come. 
But I recognize for all of you, you'd love more precision around market share. You'd love some more top line insights. I can tell you, we're off to a very strong start in February. In fact, our comps in February started with a 2 handle, and that's a 20 comp in the first part of the year.
So we'll see how that plays out in March and April, but we're off to a strong start. We took significant market share in the fourth quarter. If you recall our comments in earlier meetings, we talked about the fact that in the first 3 quarters of the year, we had picked up approximately $6 billion of market share. So we added another $3 billion of market share during the holiday season, where all of our competitors were operating. So I think the vibrancy of our model, our ability to execute is something that I would ask all of you to focus in on. And I recognize you've got to do that in light of the fact that we haven't provided the precision that we normally do at this time."

The biggest factor in '21 was the supply chain and digital pressure, about 110 basis points of pressure on the year from that. But I think that's actually a good place to illustrate somewhat how we think about rate. Because to me, it's all about the dollar impact, not the rate impact. And digital is a perfect example. If you would have told us we could double the digital business and only see 110 basis points of pressure last year, I think we all would have taken that outcome. But more important than that, when we're growing digital, we're deepening our relationship with guests. And great things happen in aggregate to us when that occurs. 
And so sign me up for more digital growth going forward. We know that's a behavior that will be sticky. Because what comes with that, in addition to a little bit of rate pressure on the margin line, is hugely accretive sales benefits in total. And so biggest driver in 2021 for sure and I would welcome more digital growth going forward and we expect that's a place where we'll continue to excel."

They gained market share, very strong results for the business serving our retail partners. And just as important, and I'll come back to this, is Shipt has become an integral part of Target and our fulfillment on same-day operations. So incredibly important there. But I think the team down in Birmingham did an outstanding job this year, just scaling the business, right? They doubled the number of shoppers. We talked about how the Target sales on Shipt grew by 300%. Memberships grew by 130%. We continue to add great retail partners like Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond and several local and regional grocers. And so they've done just a really great job continuing to scale that business. 
I think when it comes to Shipt and obviously, the relationship with Target, incredibly important part about our same-day options. And you heard us talk all morning today about the key lever that having that suite of fulfillment, same-day fulfillment options for our Target guest has been over the past year and really over the past several years and will continue to be in the future. Not only is that the preferred way our guest continues to grow with us, but they're also economically advantaged. And so we see -- we continue to see huge opportunities for Shipt to continue to work directly with Target to continue to fulfill our guest's needs. 
The other thing I would say, is we see when a -- very similar to Drive Up, when a guest engages with Shipt through Target, again, we see growth in our sales in-store and online on the Target platform as well. So they get more engaged with Target. That is hugely valuable for us. So we bought that capability 3 years ago thinking this is what it would be. It would be incredibly important for us from a same-day perspective. It has only become more so has that accelerated through 2020."

At that time, we said the most important investment we were making was in our team. And I think the results we've seen in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020, is a by-product of that commitment to our team. Investing in wages and benefits, investing in training and career opportunities. And I think it's allowed us to build the best team in retail that's incredibly engaged, that's focused on taking care of our guests, but also taking care of each other. And our team was really the star of 2020. They stepped up during the pandemic and made sure we created a safe shopping environment. 
As we scale Drive Up and saw growth rates of 500% or 600%, they flexed and we're able to meet the needs of the guests. So I think the fact that we've taken a leadership position with wages, invested in our team, provided them the opportunities to grow their careers, that's a hallmark of the commitment we've made at Target to creating the best team in retail. And I think it's provided great returns on investments for shareholders. So we'll continue to make sure we invest in our team. 
To your question around design, the investments we've made in food and beverage, Good & Gather is off to a tremendous start, a multibillion-dollar brand in a short period of time. It's been well received by our guests, great quality, had a great value. And I think it typifies the things we do with our owned brands. And we're very excited about the momentum we had in food and beverage. We took significant market share throughout the year. And the guest has certainly recognized and appreciates the Good & Gather brand. So we think that's a way for us to continue to differentiate our offerings. And as John mentioned, we'll continue to add fresh products to our Drive Up assortment and Pick Up assortment throughout the year, providing our guests access to more of those products that they're looking for each and every day."

First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it. So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt",422,"Scott, I think on fulfillment costs, we continue to make progress on our fulfillment costs through 2 paths. First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it. So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt today, ship-from-store, all of those are cheaper than they were 2 years ago. So we continue to see our costs come down there. 
The second way we see our costs come down is through mix. Drive Up, Order Pick Up and Shipt all have much better economics, as we've said for years than shipping from the back of our stores, which also has better economics than shipping from our fulfillment centers. So we -- and they are the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio. In addition to that, ship-from-store grows much faster than fulfillment. So we see favorable mix as well. So we continue to be really pleased with the progress we're making on the unit economics of shipping or delivering goods, fulfilling goods to our guests.
The only thing I might add to that is, I mean, John talked about the power of having stores hit the hub of that fulfillment equation, and that helps all those marginal economics. But also important not to forget is the thing that matters most economically with digital is the growth in guest spend in total as they become those omnichannel guests that have a deeper relationship with Target overall. 
And so any time we're looking at the slice and dicing of the P&L by channel, which we do a lot of, and we've made a lot of progress getting more efficient over time, that always has to be stapled to the greater impact of that greater guest spend in total as they use more and more of our digital fulfillment services. 
Scott, one of the examples we've shared over the last year is the Target guest that is now using Drive Up, actually spends more money in store. It just deepens that relationship. So we can look at the economics, fulfillment node by fulfillment node, but it's really how it all comes together and how we deepen relationship with our guests, get them to use all of our assets and utilize both stores and digital fulfillment channels over time. So as John said, we're going to continue to improve the economics of each one of those capabilities but it's really the sum of the parts and that deeper relationship we build as our guests use more of our fulfillment nodes over time."

And that helps us on the cost question that you asked. It's cheaper to ship a box a shorter distance from a local store after it's ridden our supply chain rails all the way to that store. Same-day fulfillment economics look a lot like store economics to us. And that's the piece to John's point that's growing fastest. And so the stores give us an incredible advantage to have advantaged cost profile as we fulfill. 
The other thing that the stores give us that has been incredibly valuable this year is great flexibility. We've seen the ability for stores to scale to meet guests' need in a way that I think probably would have surprised us if we can go back a year in time and see it all coming. But stores are so flexible. There's real power in being able to say, it's that same piece of inventories sitting on a shelf, and we can put it in a box and ship it out the back. We can drop it in a guest's trunk via a Drive Up. They can place it in their cart on a store trip and not having to be able to see perfectly exactly how that demand is going to come, but knowing the inventory can fulfill it and our great store team can make it happen however the guest chooses to shop gives us a huge flexibility advantage as well."

So the other thing that we've talked about periodically is the importance of mix in our business. And over time, our multi-category portfolio is a huge asset. Christina has been obviously in a merchant chair for a number of years and understands the importance of balancing our multi-category portfolio, the balance between our owned brands and national brands. And as John and Michael have talked about periodically, as we think about the future from a digital standpoint, we think that's going to continue to move more and more towards same-day, which from a mix standpoint is very advantageous to us. So I think our outlook for margin over the long-term is very bullish. 
As we leverage our multi-category portfolio, we continue to build our owned brands as well as great national brand partners.

We're encouraged to see the stickiness of a lot of the new behaviors that were tried in 2020. 
So things like Drive Up, thanks to the incredible experience our store teams provide. Once guests try a service like that, they come back and we've seen higher rates of stickiness this year than historically for some of those digital fulfillment services. And that bodes well for the stickiness of those guests and those behaviors going forward. And so while we do watch new guests, and it's great to get a new guest and convert them to a deeper Target guests over time, a lot of America shops Target and it's the deepening of those existing guests as they shop us in new and different ways and more often, that's our focus."

We're eager to share our insights on the extraordinary year that just passed, as well as our vision for what's next. But I couldn't start today without reflecting on the fact that 1 year ago at this time, the pandemic was just beginning to unfold. And in an effort to keep everyone safe and limit travel, we decided to convert this meeting to a virtual format. While we miss hosting our in person gatherings, it's prudent to stick with virtual presentations once again this year. But we're looking forward to resuming our live events, including this one and our Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2022.
As I look back over the past year, a year when so much care and compassion was called for, I see purpose, coupled with capabilities as the essential enabler of our response. And the story of Target in 2020 is the story of a team that wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us, drawing on capabilities that were equal to that ambition after years of building an investment.  
So I want to start today by publicly recognizing and thanking our team. I'm incredibly proud of the resilience, empathy, care and concern they've shown for each other, our guests and communities through a very challenging 12 months and counting. None of what we'll share today would've happened without them. Even before the dramatic challenges of last year took hold, our team had been busy building the retail platform of tomorrow. But 2020 accelerated everything and, as such, our guests are already benefiting from and loving that platform today. At the heart of the platform was the belief that consumers would continue to flock to out stores for multicategory one-stop shopping; a friendly, well-trained and knowledgeable team; and joyful experiences.
As we designed our strategy and invested accordingly, we relentlessly asked ourselves what products and services those stores should offer, where they should be located, how their operations should be tailored to meet neighborhood needs and ultimately, how to make our stores work together with all of our other assets as one shopping platform that would keep guests turning to Target however they want to shop. In answering those questions, we did 2 things at once: We placed the physical store more firmly at the center of our omnichannel platform and we created a durable, sustainable and scalable business model that puts Target on a road of our own.
Our goal was to use our proximity, nearly 1,900 stores within 10 miles of the vast majority of the U.S. consumers to offer the fastest and easiest digital fulfillment in retail. And the capabilities we built to become America's easiest place to shop also cracked the essential question of how to grow our digital sales exponentially, while maintaining the overall profitability of our business. When we began this journey, we didn't know we would be facing a global pandemic, mass quarantines, rapid unemployment and the need to limit the number of people in public spaces. And yet, when those threats emerged in 2020, we were ready. And without hesitation, millions of American families turned to Target like never before. That happened because of decisions we made 4 and 5 years ago. And today, Christina Hennington, our recently named Chief Growth Officer, along with John Mulligan and Michael Fiddelke, will join me in mapping out how our team's efforts in recent years created a new baseline from which we'll continue to climb higher for our guests.
And here's what I hope you'll take away from our story. First, that our team's ability to act and react in 2020 was years in the making. Without our multiyear roadmap to develop new capabilities and bring them to scale, 2020 could've exposed essential gaps in our business model. Instead, it proved beyond a doubt the durability of our model and it signaled our potential for continued growth in years ahead.
The second takeaway stems from a question I've heard frequently, especially in 2020, ""Brian, what's the secret to Target's growth trajectory?"" What you'll see in our presentation today is that the one thing that's driving our success is a focused commitment to several things: an integrated collection of strategies and capabilities that all work together, are very difficult to replicate and, ultimately, make Target unique.
I'll start today with a high level recap of our full year results. When we gathered virtually for this meeting last year, I shared how our revenue had grown by $5.4 billion since 2017, and that we were consistently gaining share in many of our core merchandising categories. In other words, we were already starting to see steady growth from our investments.
When we left that meeting, no one knew that COVID-19 would be declared a pandemic in the United States, only a couple of weeks later. In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we only receive one COVID-related question that day. But today, as we look back on 2020, the business highlights are clear: Our revenue during the year increased another $15 billion. We gained meaningful market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories, totaling about $9 billion. Our full year comparable sales were up more than 19%, with a store comp of more than 7% in a year when people were staying home to stay safe, and a digital comp of 145%. Standing at this meeting 3 or 4 years ago, it would have been hard for any of us, or any of you, to imagine digital penetration of 18% without a dramatic deterioration in our P&L. Yet today, we announced record high full year adjusted EPS of $9.42. 
Importantly, we accomplished all of this while making huge incremental investments in our team's safety and well-being and completely reoutfitting our stores to keep our team and guests safe. Far for being a fluke, this performance is further proof that we've built a business model that is working as intended, one that puts Target in a category of its own.  
A few consistent pillars have been and will continue to be at the heart of our playbook. The enormous investments we made in supply chain, store operations and technology capabilities are already powering exponential growth in digital commerce. They've enabled us to use our stores and showrooms and service centers, but also as hubs for digital fulfillment. Without these investments, we simply wouldn't have been able to satisfy the exploding guest demand for same-day services, represented by more than 600% growth in Drive Up. 
Likewise, Shipt is an extraordinary capability that grew by more than 300% last year and will continue to grow as more guests recognize the power of having their purchases brought to their doorstep in as little as 1 hour. We have consistently invested in our merchandising strength, like our differentiated owned brand portfolio, our curated national brands, inspired limited time offering and strategic relationships that run the gamut from web only start-ups looking for omnichannel scale to premier partners like Disney, Apple, Levi's and Ulta Beauty.
We're continuously improving our physical and digital shopping experience, investing billions in store remodels, specialized store rows and service training for our teams, while continuing to open up new small formats in urban centers, major college campuses and iconic tourist destinations. Most importantly, we're continuing to invest in our team. Even before 2020's outsized incremental expenditures on team health and safety, Target was an employer of choice, an academy company for those looking for a rewarding and purposeful careers. In addition to accelerating our $15 starting wage in 2020, we celebrated our team's exceptional efforts with 5 separate recognition bonuses, most recently in January when we invested another $200 million to reward each of our frontline team members $500. 
As we develop capabilities, like Target Circle, or acquire them, like Shipt, we do so with a clear vision for how they'll work together in service to our guests. Ultimately, the value they create in our core business has to contribute to our retail offering that's greater than the sum of the parts. But when we look at these elements individually, it's strikingly clear how much value we've added in a very short time. In 2016, our digital transformation was only beginning, we weren't even a top 10 e-commerce provider, and we were just getting our same-day services off the ground. Today, we have the most complete suite of same-day fulfillment services in the industry. We're one of the leading e-commerce players. And for Click and Collect same-day services, we continue to deliver industry-leading growth and dollar volume as well as Net Promoter Scores over 80% despite record demand.
In 2016, we had about 30 small format stores. Today, we have 140 and we'll add another 30 to 40 per year over the next several years. If these stores were standalone chain, they're revenue would rival that of fast-growing chains with many more locations. In 2016, we launched Pillowfort and Cat & Jack, touching off our owned brand reinvention that has since resulted in more than 30 new brands, with more on the way this year. By the time we gathered for this meeting last year, Cat & Jack and 5 other owned brands were generating $1 billion or more apiece in annual sales, and that tally has continued to grow.
We cleared 2020 with 10 of owned brands each generating $1 billion or more and 4 of those across the $2 billion per year threshold. Any one of these brands alone would be a sizable retailer and, as you know, their contribution profits is outsized. Of course, owned and exclusive brands are just one component of our merchandising strategy, which is always run on curated national brands across our assortment.
As we've expanded capabilities in recent years, we've also steadily built our roster of strategic partners. Levi's is an excellent example of how we can build upon a longstanding collaboration and help strategic partners catapult into new product categories. We started partnering with Levi's years ago on the DENIZEN denim brand and that partnership grew to include Levi's Red Tab apparel and build out presence in hundreds of stores and on target.com. Just this last Sunday, we launched the Levi's for Target collection, a limited time offering of home goods. This is the first foray by Levi's into this category and it's a great example of combining their strengths with ours, including our incredible sourcing and product design and development capabilities to forge new potential for both of our brands.
Meanwhile, our team is also gearing up to introduce Ulta Beauty at Target to our stores and target.com, starting with the first 100 stores later this year. From this initial batch, we'll test, we'll learn and we'll expand hundreds of additional locations over time. This partnership combines Ulta Beauty's unparalleled assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty with our large high-growth traffic-driving beauty business and the ease and convenience of our fulfillment services. Together, we'll be able to offer guests access to established, emerging and prestige beauty brands as well as expert beauty consultation in an industry leading omnichannel retail experience.
As a standalone or isolated innovation, each of these elements I mentioned, has something in common with the other. Each was advanced based on how it would complement out other assets and capabilities and we tested each one with an eye towards scale. In fact, the ability to integrate and scale is a key component of our decision making. And to emphasize the critical importance of scalability, I simply think back to what we could've done in 2016 but didn't. At that time, conventional wisdom held that the only way forward was for retailers to build capacity, to send more packages to homes. Instead, we went our own way, built a fulfillment model with our guest local store at the center and took the initiative on same-day. We could just as easily have constructed additional fulfillment centers and driven the shift to digital sales with more ship-to-home capacity. But as you know, the economics were terrible and we wouldn't have been differentiated.
In short, we didn't see the textbook solution as scalable or as likely to do what we've done, namely set the groundwork for years of guest satisfaction and brand loyalty, as represented by comments like this, ""Thank you for providing curbside pickup. It actually was the determining factor in me buying from Target instead of one of those online retailers."" Or this, or this or this note from a guest who simply said, ""Please always continue to do curbside pick up. It is such a help even outside of COVID. This is a wonderful service and I'll continue to choose Target for this very reason.""
So where do we go from here? And how do we keep climbing from this strong new baseline? In the near term, we'll continue to generate incredible value by executing on our strategy. Throughout the pandemic, we've built deep trust and loyalty with our guests who clearly prefer the ease and everyday inspiration of shopping at Target, along with our relentless commitment to the safety and cleanliness of our shopping environment. This is a decades long commitment that was only emphasized by the pandemic, and it will continue to be a differentiator in the months and years ahead.
Our multi-category merchandise portfolio is a huge advantage, particularly as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. And we're absolutely committed to delivering value and everyday affordability, which is important in any environment, but particularly as the economic consequences of COVID continue to play out. At the same time, we'll continue to listen closely to our stakeholders and to build upon our strategy. So in the years ahead, you'll see continuous iteration and improvement in the pillars I've mentioned already. But we'll also focus on better localizing our experience, applying learning from our small format expansion. And we'll continue to build scale and personalizing the experience, leveraging capabilities like Target Circle to better understand our guests and find new ways to engage and reward the 90 million members who have joined so far.
To ensure we're continuously delivering great value and emphasizing everyday affordability, we'll stay laser focused on being priced right daily. And on showcasing our value with clear messaging and relevant promotions. Importantly, we'll also double down on an approach to sustainability that builds on our rich legacy and company purpose. This includes decades of community relations, corporate responsibility and philanthropic leadership grounded in our 75-year track record of giving 5% of pre-tax profits in the support of vibrant and inclusive communities. 
Our intent is to further use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet, building on the work we've done already to elevate our offering of sustainable brands, to create equity and opportunity in our communities and to help protect the environment. High stakeholder expectations for corporate responsibility only increased in the pandemic and the 2020 demonstrations for social justice. And as we've seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation. So this is work that's important, not just to our guests, our team members, our investors and our communities but to ensuring our business model remains durable for years to come.
The best predictor of whether we can follow through on our aspiration is a track record of taking care of our team, serving our guests and communities and responsibly growing our business. And to give you a more detailed picture of how we'll continue to do that in the years ahead, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to weigh in. Christina?"

It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back",1400,"Thanks, Brian. It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back in 2003. Since then, I've held a number of roles across merchandising. Over that time, I've seen a lot in our business, ups and downs, good years and rebuilding years, economic booms and a great recession. But I've never seen anything like last year. Of course, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event, challenging our team and our guests in ways we never could have imagined. But how we responded at Target, empowering our teams, moving quickly and leveraging the power of our multi-category assortment, that's Target at its best. In fact, that's Target better than I've ever seen us. 
So when I think about my new role in bringing together insight, strategy and innovation, plus planning, design, sourcing and buying functions, it's not about fixing anything, it's about improving on what worked so well last year. It's about keeping Target relevant by staying ahead of what our guests need and it's about positioning Target to drive growth in 2021 and for years to come. We were successful last year because we gave our guests a lot of reasons to be confident in shopping at Target. The work of our frontline teams to keep our stores safe and clean has made Target a destination, a happy place as our guests limit other trips out of their homes. 
Our suite of same-day fulfillment options was a game changer, driving triple-digit growth in our digital sales. And regardless of whether our guests were strolling our aisles or scrolling on our app, we struck that balance between replenishment and discovery. Through the breadth of our assortment, along with a single view of inventory and teams leading across all channels, we were able to move with speed and agility, meeting guest needs despite the fastest changing environment we've ever faced. 
A lot of you probably saw this last spring in observing our business or in your own lives. In the space of just a few weeks at the outbreak of the pandemic, guests stocked up on food, beverages and essentials. Then they turned to us for help in converting kitchen tables into classroom space and spare bedrooms into home offices. And then they look to Target for fitness gear, games and other entertainment as they settled in for the long haul. That kind of volatility continued throughout 2020. In fact, one of the only constants last year was that no matter what happened, our guests turned to Target for help to meet functional needs to get through the pandemic and for inspiration and joy, especially around those key seasonal moments that took on added importance for so many people last year. 
So we never looked at our business from the perspective of a particular category. Instead, we shaped our business decisions around what was happening in the world. That's something we'll continue to guide us. Because when we focus on what's happening in the lives of our guests, it's obvious what categories we need to flex to keep building on the trust they placed in Target. Our multi-category assortment is a competitive advantage because it keeps Target relevant no matter what. But how we manage that assortment, the premium we place on curation, partnerships and product design and development, that's what differentiates Target. 
Brian touched briefly on our billion and multibillion-dollar owned brands. Our owned brand portfolio, which spans all categories, is vital to the success of our business. It represents about 1/3 of our total sales and even more of our gross margin, which helps to sustain key enterprise investments. And Target's owned brands continue to generate strong growth because of our approach to creating, designing and maintaining these brands. They're not just private labels, they're brands our guests trust, they're brands our guests love. 
A great example of this is in the athleisure space. Even before athleisure became work-from-home apparel, this was a hot category, and it was an area where we had room to raise our game. So early in 2020, we launched All in Motion. And last month, it became a $1 billion brand. That didn't happen by chance. We were able to respond to this trend quickly and build a beloved brand because we invested in co-creating this brand with our guests. Our team talked to 15,000 people, we consulted with 65 fitness pros and we had team members attend dozens of workout classes with our guests. That's the kind of work we put into owned brands across our assortment in every category. So whether it's sweating through a spin class or talking to parents and kids about how Cat & Jack can meet their needs or taste testing every recipe in our Good & Gather assortment before we launch, we go the extra mile, resulting in brands our guests don't just buy because we offer them at a good price, but instead, brands they love, brands that are the reason why they're shopping at Target in the first place. 
And that work continues. This year, we'll announce and launch several new owned brands in areas where we know Target can make a difference for our guests. This focus on making Target irresistible through our products and our experience also applies to how we work with our national brand partners. And it's an approach that has made targeted place where national brands thrive. You've heard about Levi's, including the limited time Home Collection that just set and the Ulta Beauty at Target shops we're adding to our stores and target.com this year. Those are great examples of what Target represents for our partners. Levi's is an iconic brand that, for a long time, have thrived largely in department store environments. But as they began exploring new platforms, they turned to Target. And Ulta Beauty is an incredible leader in specialty beauty. Through our new partnership, we'll provide access to brands we know our guests love, but previously had to go elsewhere to get. 
This kind of work is a big part of what makes Target special, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, in fact, we began rolling out a dedicated Apple experience, starting in 17 stores across the country and online. We're doubling the Apple footprint in these stores with new lighting fixtures and displays for Apple products, including an extended assortment of accessories. We have a new dedicated Apple landing page on our digital channels and we'll offer our guests more expertise with Apple train team members in these stores and enhanced product videos on our app and website. This is really exciting because we're taking the work we've done with Apple over the last 15 years and making it even better. 
Finally, I want to touch on a body of work that's incredibly important. The efforts underway to make Target more relevant and more welcoming for black guests. Over the last few years, we've listened carefully to our multicultural guests as a whole, and we recognized there was an opportunity to do more for black guests. So we've added more brands and products that we know they love. A great example is what we've done in the beauty space with 50 black-owned and black-founded brands now available in our industry-leading assortment. But we're committed to doing even more in key categories through our owned brands and partnerships, building on our progress to ensure that we're delivering on our purpose of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. 
The retail landscape is never static. So the retailers that will win are the ones that have a durable business model, something we've built at Target. But just as important, the retailers that will be best positioned for the future are the ones with the closest connection to their customers and the ability to flex to meet their changing needs. That was critical to Target's success last year. And that obsession with listening to our guests, understanding the things that are shaping their world and meeting their needs for convenience and ease, inspiration and discovery across all channels is what has Target poised for continued growth in the years ahead. 
Thank you. And now I'll hand the meeting over to John."

While most people expect the operations guy to get right into the technical stuff, like capacity, throughput and automation, and don't worry, I will get there, I'm going to start with our people, the Target team. In a year when the flexibility and scalability of our operation was pressure tested, our team rose to the challenge, just like they always do. They were the connection between processes, technology and physical assets, that allow us to deliver safety, ease, reliability and even a bit of joy during a year of uncertainty for our guests. Of course, the team wasn't starting from scratch. As you heard already this morning, we've been investing in them for years and building capabilities that would set them up to better serve our guests in any time, let alone a global pandemic. 
Let me take you back for a minute to one of our favorite reference points. It was early 2016 and Target's strategy was coming into focus. After years of testing and listening to our guests, we knew that betting on our stores, an uncommon proposition at the time, would be at the heart of a durable and scalable model. And we needed an operation with the right capabilities to drive it. Getting there wouldn't be fast or easy. Quarter-after-quarter, we tested, iterated and learned how to modernize our supply chain, update our stores, use them as fulfillment hubs and train our team to bring every part to life. Then we had to learn how to do it at scale.
In 2019, all these efforts started operating together, and we saw tangible proof through financial results, market share gains and guest satisfaction scores that our work was paying off. Fast forward to 2020, we were ready for the world to change. But only because of the years we'd spent laying the operational foundation. The story of how we navigated the twists and turns of 2020 starts with replenishment because the whole operation relies on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. This last quarter, 95% of all sales, online and in person were fulfilled by our stores, which is why it's critical they have enough of the inventory our guests want to buy. Without that piece, the operation simply stops. When the pandemic hit last spring, our guest shopping behaviors changed nearly overnight. We saw heavy stock up trips, huge in-store surges and then a quick shift to online shopping. To meet the needs of the guests, our supply chain had to turn on a dime.  
We sent hundreds more deliveries than we planned every day to replenish stores fast and often. Flexibility we'd learned from opening dozens of small format stores. We prioritize the flow of essential inventory like paper towels and cleaning wipes, to quickly send stores more of what they needed, not just what was planned. As we sold every paper product we had last March, we expedited everything we could from our vendor partners and secured greater allocations of additional inventory as they ramped up to produce more.
In a normal year, we just spent months preparing for the traditional Q4 shopping spike. But in 2020, our peak season started in March. And after months of moving record volume, we have become increasingly efficient in how we managed high levels of demand. So when the holidays actually did arrive, we leaned into what was already working. We sent more inventory to stores than ever to prepare for an earlier holiday rush. We front-loaded those deliveries with the seasonal merchandise guests would expect so our stores would be stocked and ready, and we continue prioritizing essential products, like cleaning supplies and health care items, so we could keep meeting the pressing needs of our guests.
The flexibility of our supply chain set up our stores to play an essential role in our communities. Because we could restock shelves quickly, guests could count on Target for what they needed, whether they came inside or shopped online. And when our digital business picked up last spring, our fulfillment operation went into high gear. Up to that point, our same-day fulfillment services had already been rolled out nationwide. Millions of guests were loving them because they're fast and easy. We always love them because they're incredibly efficient. Without the shipping expense, these orders look much more like a store sale than a traditional online transaction, costing on average 90% less than if we'd shipped it from a warehouse. And at the start of 2020, our same-day sales were growing at a healthy clip. Come spring, when consumers saw the need for more contactless ways to shop, those services exploded. And we had the infrastructure in place to grow alongside demand. 
Brian gave you the full year highlights on Drive Up, up more than 600%, and even Order Pick Up, which has been around for years, still grew more than 70%.  Beyond our pickup options, the delivery capability we have in Shipt became even more important. It filled the need for guests who wanted an online order, especially for perishable items, but also for so many other essentials across Target, brought right to their front doors. It offered more personalization, reliability and speed than they could get from a packaged shipment. And as a result Shipt's target sales grew more than 300%. Of course, we continue to ship online orders from the back of our local stores, saving 40% of the cost of shipping from a warehouse, an economic advantage for us as digital sales now account for even more of our total revenue.
With third-party carriers fielding historic levels of volume, we worked closely with our partners to plan for capacity constraints and send millions and millions of packages to guest store's steps. But the popularity of our same-day services gave guests another option to shop from home, yet receive their orders faster, reliably and on their own time. Guests had Shipt deliver when it matched their schedule instead of guessing when a shipment would arrive. They drove through our pickup lanes when they were already out and about. No appointment required. This gave guests a flexibility they couldn't find anywhere else. The extraordinary growth of those services has shown just how much guests value that convenience, speed and peace of mind and the comfort they find in having a contactless option.
In fact, we found that what we built to make Target the easiest place to shop had also set us up to be one of the safest. I've said countless times that a benefit of using our stores as hubs is our ability to ramp-up in peak times and ramp back down based on demand. This last year, the stores ramped up and stayed there. In early spring, our stores were fulfilling more in a single day than they had an entire week the year before, day after day after day. At the same time, they were also continuing to support a safe and easy in-store experience, which also drove strong comps. As our digital business continued to pick up steam, our stores sustained that pace for months on end. Records were set and then broken again and again and again.  
But the years we spent building a rock-solid fulfillment capability in our stores prepared us to handle waves of volume without sacrificing the guest experience. Stores knew how to staff for peaks, train other store team members to pitch in when things got busy and adjust storage space to hold more orders. Despite wild growth, our Net Promoter Scores that represent guest satisfaction stayed incredibly high. It's one thing for our teams to adjust to record volume, but it's even more impressive to do it while we enhance the services themselves. As digital demand surged, we simultaneously broadened the assortment to make even more of the store available for same-day fulfillment. We added apparel to Shipt's delivery offerings and tested adult beverage pickup in a handful of markets. Most notably, we added fresh and frozen grocery to Drive Up and Order Pick Up. Although this expansion was already in the plan, we accelerated the rollout to go nationwide this summer, offering even more guests essential groceries through our contactless services. 
Importantly, we also adjusted the process to make our services even safer and more efficient. With Drive Up and Order Pick Up, guests now display a PIN on their phones from a distance or through a car window so teams can securely deliver the right order while staying farther apart. We gave additional store team members back up training and fulfillment. For example, when we temporarily closed our Starbucks cafés, we taught hundreds of baristas how to efficiently pick and pack an order. That allowed us to keep those team members on the schedule and build their skills, while also helping us manage high volumes during peak times. And we added thousands of Drive Up parking spots, so guests could get in and out even faster.
At the same time, Shipt more than doubled its shopper network to increase the number of delivery windows it could offer to keep up with soaring demand. It's worth taking a minute to emphasize that using our stores to support digital demand is only possible because of the trust and collaboration across many teams at Target. It's not just a stores operation or a supply chain effort, it's the product of many teams strategizing around a common purpose to deliver for our guests. That one team mindset is what built the capabilities we have today and is what allowed us to adjust swiftly when the business accelerated unexpectedly. 
We built an operation to handle the healthy digital growth we expected through the middle of this decade. The only surprise was that we got there last year much sooner than planned. Although we designed for that kind of flexibility and scale in the long run, our team hadn't planned for it to come all at once, and that's what makes their outstanding execution with no advanced warning, all the more remarkable. Advancing the business several years in a matter of months prove that our model is scalable and also prove we have the capacity to grow.  
I'd remind you of what I've shared in several of our past earnings calls. A reliable way to assess our stores throughput capacity is to look at the sales we do per square foot. And you can see that productivity has grown a lot over the last couple of years for our average stores, but also for our top quartile. The fact that we continue to see more throughput in our highest-performing stores shows the capacity we have across the rest of the chain for even more growth in the future.
With all the expectations we have for our stores, the physical buildings themselves play a huge role in our strategy. We're as committed as ever to our years long initiative to remodel stores with an inspirational specialty store feel that makes shopping easy and convenient. At the beginning of last year, we'd started about 130 full store remodels. In mid-March, to reduce distractions in our stores, we decided to complete the projects we'd started. Then we pivoted to more targeted improvements that emphasize safety, like installing plexiglass dividers and reformatting our sales floor for greater distancing.
The timing for our small-format stores also shifted. After pausing construction in the spring, our teams accelerated the work through the summer and fall to finalize more than 2 dozen stores for new local guests. Despite stopping the work for part of the year, we still opened 29 small format stores, the most completed in 1 year-to-date. From the Las Vegas Strip to UC San Diego, our first store right on campus property, we tapped into new communities. And we continued expanding across markets like New York and L.A. With each one, Target brought a safe and essential shopping experience to even more guests, while positioning us to serve those neighborhoods for years to come.
Our construction and store design teams also adjusted following the demonstrations for racial justice this summer. One of our Minneapolis stores required an entire rebuild. Without it, the local community had nowhere nearby to get essentials like baby formula and fresh food. So we partnered with local nonprofits to distribute needed supplies while putting plans in motion to reopen fast. We leaned on the expertise we developed remodeling stores and opening small formats to meet the community's needs. We listened to nearby residents, worked with local contractors, personalized the in-store experience and reopened months later as a convenient shopping destination, but also as a better partner to the neighborhood. Take a look.

You saw it in the opening video and you've heard it throughout this morning. Our team is the heartbeat of Target. And even when faced with challenges, they bring their A game. 
Several years ago, we implemented a new operating model in our stores to lift up that drive. It was a shift towards specialized roles to give our teams expertise, empowerment and a sense of ownership in how they serve our guests. With that model in place, our team could quickly adapt to the ups and downs in 2020, execute well and play an essential role in our communities. Now like anything in life, balance is good, and we found opportunities to train our specialists in other areas like teaching a hardlines expert how to fulfill an online order. So they gain skills beyond their specialized position. Those investments in their development also add flexibility to our operation.
We've always known that supporting our team would have great returns and it has. In addition to the bonuses, time off options, wellbeing benefits and expanded nationwide starting wage that Brian mentioned, we also gave our team even more hours. With a greater investment in our trained and expert workforce, we saw turnover drop and guest satisfaction rise. It's a strong testament to what can be done when we empower our teams to use their skills and passions to serve our guests. The bottom line is that as our business grew exponentially, our operation flexed alongside. And as we delivered for our guests, we built on the trust they put in us to meet their needs and make it easy.  
Going forward, we're taking the capabilities that drove Target in 2020 and accelerating them to continue making Target, the safest and easiest place to shop. As we do, we'll invest in more capacity and greater efficiencies. So we're positioned to continue growing for the long term.
In our supply chain, that starts with expanding our network so we continue to have replenishment capacity that can support our future growth. In recent years, we accommodated steady sales growth through our existing supply chain network by increasing the productivity of our buildings. In fact, the average sales per foot supported by our distribution centers rose nearly 30% between 2016 and 2020, thanks to a series of process and technology improvements. During those years, we didn't open any new DCs to support replenishment. But after our business grew nearly 20% last year, with 95% of sales driven by our stores, it's time to expand our supply chain so we can support a much higher base of sales and continue growing.
This year, we'll open 2 distribution centers to support replenishment, 1 close to the New Jersey Delaware state line and another in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. And we currently have plans for one on each coast in 2022. We're also continuing to simplify the unload process once product reaches the stores. In a nutshell, it all comes down to how we sort and organize millions of items before they arrive at the stores' loading dock.  
We've shown you the robotics capabilities we're building to help us sort inventory to the precise amount of store needs and organize it by store aisle. When we do, replenishment in stores is fast. Team members grab a tote, walk to the aisle and stock the shelf. No sorting in the back room or finding places to stash cases of excess product. We have 2 solutions that help us do that. We showed you both of these independently last year: 1 called auto-rebin sorts individual items. This is most useful for slower moving inventory, when stores only need a handful of items to put back on the shelf. Auto-rebin started in one of our local Minnesota warehouses, rolled out to 2 more and we'll expand to another 2 this year. 
The second is the robotic ships order we've been building at our Perth Amboy facility. This sorts everything, from boxes of individual items to entire cases of product. After the sort, robot sequence inventory so our team can load pallets in an order that saves stores even more time. Individually, these capabilities are hugely valuable, but they're designed to work together. This spring, we'll put both solutions in 1 warehouse to test how they bring more precision and speed to store replenishment. In Q4, we'll run them together at a small scale, doing what we always do to learn and iterate before we go bigger. Opening new warehouses and expanding our robotics capabilities are both about moving product more easily to stores. 
But just as important is being ready to send what stores need before they even know it. This year, we'll continue expanding the rollout of our predictive inventory positioning capability across our assortment. This helps us more precisely order and position product close to where we anticipate guests will want it so we can react quickly when there's demand. In turn, it improves out of stocks and lowers backroom inventory levels. In 2020, when sales spiked, this capability allowed us to order and restock products 25% faster than using our old systems. This year, we'll use it to order and position even more items in our assortment, so we can replenish the majority of the store faster for our guests. 
We've talked about how store replenishment feeds store fulfillment. This past year, our team was able to keep filling online orders because our supply chain was replenishing that inventory with speed and precision. While we continue refining our replenishment operation, we'll also build on our fulfillment capabilities to enhance the guest experience and make way for future growth. Today, the majority of our store assortment is available through our same-day services, but we're continually working to give guests even more choices. In coming months, we'll expand our pickup options further into categories like apparel and fresh food and roll adult beverage pickup to 800 more stores.
We're also continuing to improve the Target Run so it's even easier for our guests and faster for our team. For example, Drive Up guests will be able to share more preferences in the app, like telling the team where to place the order in their vehicle or signing an alternate pickup person so it's easier for a spouse or family member to pick it up. We're numbering our Drive Up spaces so our teams can find guests sooner for those times when a guest pulls up in a black SUV next to 8 other black SUVs. And we're updating the team member app, so they can more easily see what orders are in progress and where they can help.
Our same-day services have grown faster than any other fulfillment method. But when we do ship online orders, we'll continue sending the majority of those packages out the back of our stores. Since 2016, we scaled our ship-from-store capability from a low tech test in a few hundred stores to a sophisticated fulfillment operation in most Target backrooms. Now before anyone gets too worked up, I don't mean we have robots hiding in the back. Instead, we've got efficient tools, technology and process design working together, continually increasing the number of orders a store can fulfill.
Next, we'll take it a step further, developing last mile capabilities that help us continue scaling this operation so we can ship more orders from stores on even lower cost. To do it, we're testing a new type of facility here in Minneapolis called a sortation center. The idea is to make our stores' hub model even more efficient, while also reducing our load on external carriers. Take a look.

In the end, it allows us to get orders to guests faster and at a lower cost. While we're still ramping up production at this first test facility, we're very confident in this concept and plan to open 5 additional sites in other urban markets later this year.
In 2021, we'll also open more stores, accelerating our growth with 30 to 40 new locations a year, a pace we'll keep up for the foreseeable future. With our small format strategy, we'll expand in urban markets like Portland, L.A. and New York City, where there are still opportunities to serve new guests. And we'll continue our focus on college stores with the University of Georgia and the University of Michigan planned for later this year. We remain extremely bullish on our college sites. Even as the pandemic sent students to online classrooms and sales softened at many of those stores, we see them as a long-term play to serve the college guests, many of whom are on the brink of adulthood and building lifelong shopping habits.
We'll also open a number of midsized stores to serve dense suburban neighborhoods from Denver to Brooklyn. As hundreds of retail vacancies have left holes in communities across the country, we've committed to sites where we can fill a need for the local guests. And as retail real estate prices have declined this year, we found these opportunities to serve new communities to be even more affordable. Along with opening new stores, we'll get back to remodeling our existing fleet. After stopping our full store remodels last spring, we'll pick back up later this year and complete about 150 stores in time for holiday, and we'll plan to ramp up to more than 200 stores a year in 2022 and beyond. 
Safety and ease have become the heart of Target shopping experience, and we'll incorporate what we learned during 2020 into our future store design. That includes implementing more contactless features, from our restrooms to our checkouts and adding distance between merchandise and at the check lanes. And as you heard from Christina, we'll also bring brand partnerships to life in our stores throughout 2021. A great example is the work we'll do to add Ulta Beauty to our sales floor, creating a specialty environment that's seamlessly integrated into the Target experience. Similarly, we'll use store design elements to highlight additional brands like Disney and Apple for our guests. 
We're investing in a lot of really exciting developments to fuel Target's growth. But what they all have in common, they're giving our team the tools or the backdrop to take better care of our guests and each other. That shows up most in our stores where the vast majority of our 350,000 team members bring our brand to life for guests across the country. A huge priority for our stores this year is adjusting our staffing strategies to create more predictability for our team. That's a challenge in any retail job, where ours are based on dynamic factors like consumer shopping patterns and changing team needs. But we know having an engaged team with more consistent hours leads to higher productivity, greater efficiency and lower turnover. It creates a place where people join to learn a job and stay to build a career and better serve our guests in the long run. So we'll train team members to take on other roles across the store and offer the option for longer shifts.
We'll also build on our stores' operating model by introducing a new standard of service to our teams. It's not a checklist, but a set of principles that define great service, like welcoming a guest and paying attention to what they need, which might be as simple as finding an item or as big as building an outfit. It's meant to give our team flexibility and empower them to do what's right for the guests in the moment. Without our team, everything else you heard today comes to a standstill. The Target team continues to be the most important part of our operation, and I want to say an enormous thank you to all our team members for all they do to serve our guests and our communities.
You've seen us make a lot of operational investments over the last few years, in our team, in our stores and in our capacity for long-term growth. In the most recent quarter, those returns were clear. We've created an operation unlike anyone else with our physical assets working together, centered on our stores and fueled by our team to serve our guests and grow for the long term. The capabilities we built not only allowed us to navigate the most volatile time in retail history but show that they can flex and grow to serve the ever-changing needs of the consumer. The work isn't done. We're constantly refining an operation that is efficient, fast and supportive of Target's durable and scalable business model. From an engineer by training and a finance guy at heart, I can attest that you can't get too efficient or relevant enough. There's no finish line for continuous improvement and innovation. We'll keep making bets on the capabilities that give us the flexibility to serve guests well into the future.
We have a lot of strength heading into 2021 and a lot of work still in front of us. But with a sound operational foundation and the talent and resilience of the Target team driving us ahead, I look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters and years to come.  
With that, Michael, I'll hand it over to you.

Those news clips paint a vivid picture of the roller coaster our team and our business experienced throughout 2020. All in all, it was a standout year in which everything we've spent years developing and building came together to serve our guests like never before. 
So today, after a year of record growth, I want to start my remarks by expanding on a point Brian mentioned earlier because investors often want to know, how much of Target's growth is being driven by specific strategies or specific assets? For example, they want to know if we can isolate how much of our growth is coming from Drive Up, from digital and total, our owned brand work, remodel program and any other way we can slice and dice the data. And I understand the impulse. Our internal team often wants to do the same thing. And of course, as a self described data geek, I'm inclined to think the same way.
But then I see data like we first shared with you last year. Guests who tried Drive Up for the first time spend about 30% more on average compared with before, including an increase in conventional store shopping. And we see a similar change in behavior among guests who try Shipt for the first time. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of Drive Up and Shipt go far beyond the value of an individual trip. They're both capabilities that drive guest affinity, creating value that extends well beyond the services themselves.
That same thinking applies to our merchandise categories. If you focus only on the amount of sales or growth by category, you can miss how they all work together to drive guest affinity. I see how this plays out with my own family. Over the next few months, the cold weather in Minnesota will finally end, and my kids will need warm weather clothes. On the next Saturday morning Target run, we'll shop for those clothes, and we'll also pick up some food, a few office supplies, laundry detergent and maybe a prescription from CVS. We might wander over and purchase some spring decor. And we'll probably need some more earbuds since the kids seem to be inventing new ways to lose or destroy them. And on our way out, we'll probably stop at the Starbucks near the entrance so my wife and I can enjoy a coffee on the way home. 
So now if you're going to analyze that basket, is there a way to know which category drove the trip? And beyond the basket itself, shouldn't we broaden the analysis even further since that trip depended on a conveniently located store that's clean, safe and fun to shop, featuring low everyday prices and a friendly and engaged team?
Over time, I've come to understand that guest engagement and financial performance are driven by everything we're doing at the same time, not any factor in isolation. Among the critical factors, of course, there are the tangible assets that show up on our balance sheet, including our stores, distribution centers and technology, but the list goes way beyond the balance sheet and includes our team, our reputation and the trust we've established with multiple stakeholders, which only deepened in 2020. Then there's the Target brand itself. Our owned and exclusive brands, capabilities like marketing, merchandising, product design and development, sourcing and so much more. And of course, there's our culture, our mission and our values, which helped to unify a diverse and widely dispersed team in support of a common purpose. 
So what's the key to our future performance? It's our continued investments in the assets and capabilities, both tangible and intangible, that we can build and integrate to drive guest engagement and growth. And how should we determine what to focus on? The answer comes from continually listening carefully to our guests. The better we know them, the more effectively we can invest in what they want and develop new ways to deliver joy and inspiration while making their lives easier. If we invest the right way, guests will reward us with more engagement and growth, which in turn will create additional opportunities to invest.  
Our success in 2020, which was years in the making, is a perfect example. It started many years ago as we engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of our business, our strategy and took a deep dive into the wants and needs of our guests. That work led to a new strategic focus, followed by years of investment of both capital and expense to roll out new fulfillment capabilities, rejuvenated stores and brands, a modern store operating model and more. Through that work, we built the foundation that allowed our team to deliver unprecedented results in the face of a rapidly changing landscape in 2020.  
So this year, our focus is to lock in last year's gains, build on that foundation, continue to deepen guest engagement and drive long-term growth. And following last year's growth of $15 billion, more than we grew over the prior 11 years combined, we're entering 2021 as a much larger company with a host of opportunities to build on last year's success.  
Digital is one of those opportunities. As John mentioned, in 2020, the penetration of digital sales advanced many years in a single year. With COVID as the catalyst, guests who had never tried our digital services quickly changed their habits and tried them sooner than they would have otherwise. We've long told you that, on average, a multichannel guest spends nearly 4x as much as a store-only guest and nearly 10x more than a digital-only guest. Now just in case there are any stats majors listening, that's a statement about correlation, not causation. So I'm not saying that a guest spending immediately changes that much after they move into a new channel. 
Even so, these averages help us to understand how deepening engagement translates to a more valuable guest relationship. And last year, Target gained an additional 12 million multichannel guests. Of course, a portion of those guests were completely new to Target, but the vast majority had previously shopped with us, but only in a single channel. The opportunity this year is to build on our now deeper relationship with these guests as we engage with them more frequently and help them migrate toward the much higher average spend we see from our multichannel guests over time.
And today, even though we already have an unmatched suite of digital fulfillment options, there's more we can do for our guests. One way is to continue expanding the assortment of fresh, refrigerated and frozen food items available for Pick Up and Drive Up. When we study the behavior of guests who first shopped for these items through one of these services last year, we saw an average increase in shopping frequency of about 1 visit per month compared with the control group. On average, these guests increase their food and beverage spending between 20% and 30%. And importantly, spend about 20% more in other categories. 
As you heard from Christina, we also have an opportunity to continue developing and launching new owned brands while we become an increasingly attractive partner for leading national brands. In the years ahead, we'll likely have many more partnership opportunities. And given our strong performance and financial position, can be very thoughtful in approaching every one of them. This begins by ensuring the partnership is right for our guests and that the partner and financial arrangement are appropriate long-term choices for our business. 
And of course, there's a huge opportunity to create value through Target Circle, which has grown in less than 2 years to include more than 90 million members. Circle is easy and free to join and members enjoy rewards that drive engagement directly, which we can measure by the increase in spending among guests who joined. But the value of Circle only begins there because it also helps us to gain an ongoing, deeper understanding of our guests and their changing preferences, helping us to connect them with the services, brands and categories that address those wants and needs.
So it's clear that we're entering 2021 with a lot of momentum and a really strong foundation with a lot more room to grow. As you heard from John, we still have a long runway to expand the available assortment for our same-day services, while we invest to broaden Shipt's reach by entering new markets while expanding in existing ones. When we acquired Shipt in late 2017, we were confident that same-day delivery was a capability every successful retailer would need to have, and we've spent the last 3 years integrating Shipt into our strategy and operations. At the same time, the acquisition has made it easier for Shipt to grow and achieve scale in new markets, given the volume that Target immediately brings to the platform. 
And as John covered, we're investing to modernize our network and add replenishment capacity to support future growth. Obviously, we came into last year with a great deal of capacity, but we used up a lot more of it than expected. Here's one way to think about it. At our current average sales per store, last year's growth of $15 billion was equivalent to the addition of more than 300 new Target stores. If we had actually opened that many new locations, we'd have needed some additional upstream capacity, and that need is the same, whether growth is coming from a bigger store footprint or higher productivity in our existing footage.
While I'm on the topic, I want to pause and address the question of whether our stores are going to run out of capacity to grow digital sales. And I'd start with what John mentioned earlier, how our top quartile of stores demonstrate the continued potential for our average stores to handle more throughput. But I want to drill down into a really specific example to provide another view of our untapped capacity. And what we can do when an individual location reaches its limit. To do that, I'm going to go way back in history and talk about our experience at the Target store in Colma, California, part of the San Francisco market.  
20 years ago, Colma had grown to be our second highest volume store in the chain, generating more than $90 million in annual sales, nearly 3x our chain average at the time. Given its extreme volume, we suspected the store was running out of capacity, which was limiting its ability to grow. So when the site of a former Montgomery Ward's became available just across the highway in Daly City, we decided to buy it and build a new Target. This was unheard of in our history, building a new store less than a mile away from an existing one, and it was a calculated risk because the new store would only make sense if it drove incremental volume. And that's exactly what happened. The combined sales of the 2 stores quickly grew far beyond what the single store was able to generate. And today, each of those locations is in the top 5% of our stores based on sales volume.
So let's come back to today. Last year, our stores fulfilled more than 95% of our total sales, which works out to an average of about $47 million in fulfilled sales per store. That means our average store today is fulfilling about half of what the Colma store was already supporting 20 years ago. This offers another clear window into the growth potential of our average store today. But will there sometimes be extreme examples of stores that hit their capacity? I hope so because we know what to do when that happens. If we have a viable real estate opportunity nearby, we can invest in another one of these modern multichannel assets we happen to call a Target store. To be clear, based on what we see today, we don't expect a lot of these opportunities over the next few years, but I'd love to be wrong about that since we'd likely generate strong returns on the new stores we could open in those markets. In the meantime, we continue to make productive investments in new small format stores, and we're eager to begin ramping up our remodel program in 2021 and beyond. 
So with all these options to generate profitable growth, we're in a position to play offense and lean into the opportunity to build on last year's momentum. As such, we're planning for annual CapEx in the $4 billion range in each of the next few years to support remodels, new stores and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network, including sortation centers. Beyond full store remodels, we'll also invest in Ulta Beauty shop in shops, while optimizing front end space in our highest volume locations, increasing the efficiency of our Pick Up and Drive Up services.
So now this is the section of my remarks in which you typically expect me to cover our P&L expectations for the year. But today, given the high level of uncertainty we continue to face, providing a lot of guidance would be an exercise on false precision. Instead, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the most important factors affecting our near-term plans as we maintain our laser focus on investing for the long term.
So first, as I think about implications for Target's top line in the months and years ahead, I think about the drivers at 3 levels of a funnel. At the widest part of the funnel are macro factors, including uncertainty about the path of COVID-19 and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine campaign. How consumer attitudes and behaviors will evolve as we emerge from the pandemic. For example, there's an emerging consensus that the nature of work will permanently change as employers move to a more flexible model and allow for more work from home. This will likely have long-lasting implications for consumer spending. And finally, beyond changes in the consumer mindset, macro considerations include the health of the economy, the near-term impact of stimulus and how quickly various industries and communities will recover from the pandemic. 
The middle stage of the funnel involves questions around potential industry trends in each of the categories we sell and every industry has its own story. And categories consumed mostly at home, including food and beverage, essentials, home and hardlines, industry trends have accelerated over the last year and could see some softness as we emerge from the crisis. However, the timing and extent is hard to predict and could be offset by permanent changes in consumer habits, including a higher percentage of work time spent at home and an elevated focus on cleanliness and health resulting from the pandemic.
In the beauty and apparel industries, which experienced softness in 2020, trends are expected to improve over time. Specifically, as people resume working in offices, attending concerts, movies and sporting events, traveling and eating out, they're likely to focus more on their appearance and spend more on these categories than they did in 2020. But let's be clear. These are just quick high-level thoughts on potential industry trends and they're far from ironclad predictions. 
So as we move to the bottom of the funnel and think about how those trends are likely to play out at Target, we first need to think about market share within those industries and on the topic of share, we have a lot of confidence as we look ahead. In 2020, Target saw unprecedented share gains across all 5 of our core merchandise categories. Importantly, these gains were not limited to the categories in which others were forced to close, and they stayed remarkably consistent throughout the year and across the country. Based on this experience and our investment focus going forward, we're optimistic about our opportunity to lock in recent share gains and deliver long-term growth on top of the foundation we've already established.
So now I want to move beyond the top line and illustrate how we're thinking about other lines on the P&L for the year. And in this discussion, beyond prior year comparisons, I will often be looking back to 2019, since that year provides a more stable baseline compared with the extreme volatility we encountered in 2020. Let's start with our gross margin line, where in 2020, we experienced large but offsetting variances related to specific factors. The first was supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure last year. While that headwind was notable, it was less than I believe most of us would have expected, given that we saw $10 billion of digital sales growth, accounting for 2/3 of our total growth. As we look ahead to this year and beyond, we expect to see a smaller amount of pressure from supply chain and digital fulfillment, given that digital growth is likely to moderate, and we continue to make progress in reducing average unit fulfillment costs. 
A second headwind to last year's gross margin rate was category mix as lower margin categories grew faster than our higher-margin categories, accounting for about 90 basis points of rate pressure. At a minimum this year, we expect category mix to exert less pressure than last year. And notably, it could easily become a tailwind like it was in prior years. However, our crystal ball is not nearly clear enough today to predict this year's category mix with any precision.
The third factor in last year's gross margin performance was our merchandising decisions, which include our pricing, mix of owned and national brands and the magnitude of our promotional and clearance markdowns. In 2020, the combination of these factors provided a significant tailwind of about 150 basis points, driven primarily by favorability and markdowns. A portion of this favorability was related to promotions, but the biggest single factor was a significant decline in clearance markdown rates as demand in seasonal and other clearance sensitive categories far outpaced our expectations. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from these abnormally low levels, which will create some gross margin pressure compared with 2020. So how do these expectations come together in 2021? As we consider the range of expectations for the combined impact of these 3 drivers, we believe that our 2021 gross margin rate will remain somewhat lower than our 2019 gross margin rate of 28.9%.
On the SG&A expense line this year, we'll be annualizing last year's significant investments in safety measures and team member pay and benefits. We'll also be annualizing the fixed cost and other scale benefits we realized throughout the year. Looking ahead, given that we're focused on locking in last year's gains, we expect to retain significant scale benefits compared with 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver continued efficiency improvements, driven by investments in our supply chain, technology and operating model, which will help to offset continued investments in our team. Altogether, we expect that our 2021 SG&A expense rate will also be lower than our 2019 rate of 20.8%. 
On the D&A expense line, we expect to see moderate dollar growth in 2021 as we ramp up remodels and accelerate depreciation on the assets we replace. Of course, rate performance will depend on the total sales we deliver this year.  
So as we consider how all of these rates come together on the operating margin line, we're facing a wide range of possibilities as we enter the year. I've already talked about the unpredictability of sales and how category and channel mix alone can impact our margin. But even with that uncertainty, we should continue to benefit from the leverage we gained in 2020. Altogether, our expectation is that this year's operating margin rate will move down from the 7% we recorded in 2020 but remain above our 2019 operating margin rate of 6%, with the most likely outcome in the lower half of that range. 
So now for those of you hoping we provide a more precise view of our expectations today, I want you to know that I feel the same way. I know that it's difficult to model our business right now. Our team is facing the same challenge. In the face of this uncertainty, we continue to put a huge premium on flexibility and agility, which served us extremely well throughout 2020. After all, flexibility is a cornerstone of our business model, which features a uniquely diverse category mix and a store-based fulfillment model that can quickly adapt to changes in guest shopping patterns. With the benefit of this model, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, we're perfectly positioned to navigate any near term uncertainty, while we continue to invest in long-term growth. And while it may sound counterintuitive, our expectations for the next few quarters feel cloudier than our view of the longer term, when we're highly confident in our ability to grow profitably and build on recent share gains.
So now before I move beyond the P&L, I want to spend a minute talking about the prior year comparisons we're facing in the first 2 quarters of this year. As you'll recall, in the first quarter last year, sales accelerated meaningfully after the onset of COVID, but our gross margin rate for the quarter declined an astounding amount, more than 4 percentage points in light of the cost to rightsize our apparel inventory.
Also in the first quarter, we began making meaningful investments in the health and safety of our team and guests, which we'd maintained throughout the year. Altogether, our first quarter earnings per share were down more than 60% compared with 2019. Contrast that with the second quarter last year when our comp sales grew more than 24%, our gross margin rate also increased and we saw a jaw dropping amount of leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines, which more than offset investments in team and guest safety. As a result, last year's second quarter EPS grew more than 80% compared with 2019. That's a swing of more than 140 percentage points in our EPS growth rates between Q1 and Q2 last year.
So as we plan and analyze our performance in the first 2 quarters of 2021, we're going to lean heavily on comparisons to the much more stable environment we experienced in 2019. This will help all of us to look through the extreme volatility and year-over-year comparisons we'll be seeing throughout the first half of this year. 
So now let's move beyond the P&L and turn to cash and capital deployment, and I want to reiterate that our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. First, we look to invest in the business and all of the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. One note, if we attain that goal in 2021, it will mark our 50th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend increases, putting us in a very small group of companies who can make that statement. And finally, we look to deploy excess cash through share repurchases only after we fully supported the first 2 goals within the capacity of our middle A credit ratings.
As you know, last year turned out to be a very strong year for cash flow in light of our sales growth and strong operational performance. As a result, we ended the year with about $8.5 billion of cash, well beyond the amount we'd maintain in ordinary times. But as strong as our year turned out to be, we can't forget the volatility we just encountered and the environment today remains far from ordinary. It's in that context that we evaluate our 2021 capital deployment expectations.
Regarding CapEx, I already outlined our plan to invest about $4 billion this year. Regarding the dividend, later this year, we expect to recommend that our Board approve a robust increase in the per share dividend. But as always, this recommendation will depend on how our business is performing. Beyond those priorities, we've resumed share repurchases this year. And depending on how the virus, the economy and our performance progresses, could have ample capacity within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.
But I will quickly say, we'll continue to be cautious and maintain an ample amount of liquidity to carry us through a wide range of near-term scenarios. As such, it may be a multiyear journey before our credit metrics move fully back to historical levels, depending on the speed with which we see more normal volatility across the economy and our business.
So now I want to turn to our after-tax ROIC. As we've long emphasized, we rely on this metric to assess the health of our business and the effectiveness of our capital deployment over time. However, as is often the case, we sometimes need to look past near-term volatility and 2020 presents a great example. That's because last year, we delivered an astounding aftertax ROIC of 23.5%, up more than 7 percentage points from already strong performance in 2019. While this outcome is remarkable and a testament to our team and operating model, I'm going to quickly say that it's artificially high and likely to come back down over time. That might sound like a strange thing to say, but it's based on a number of factors that are clear today. 
First, with unexpectedly strong sales, our inventory turns shot up last year, and we saw abnormally high payables leverage. While that had a positive near-term impact on working capital, we also saw really choppy in stocks, which isn't how we want to operate under normal conditions. In 2021, we're planning for full shelves and better in stocks, which will bring inventory turns and payables leverage back down to more sustainable levels. This will require a net investment of working capital for the year. 
Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we're leaning in to support a strong set of growth opportunities over the next few years. As we accelerate investment in stores, supply chain modernization and replenishment capacity in support of those growth prospects, we'll likely see an increase in the invested capital portion of this metric over the next few years. Bottom line, while I believe this metric will stay very healthy and compare favorably to other retailers, I expect it will move back down into the 20% range over time. This would represent very strong absolute and relative performance on a larger asset base than we've maintained in the past. 
So as I get ready to turn things back over to Brian. I want to take you back to this meeting 4 years ago, when I was listening from my headquarters in Minneapolis. During my career at Target, I've been lucky to spend time working with our stores, and I've developed a deep appreciation for the value they can deliver. So when Brian and John stood up and said we'd be investing to put our stores at the center of everything we do, including both digital and physical shopping, I had a ton of confidence in that plan. It was a plan based on carefully listening to our guests, it was differentiated and we were fortunate to have the necessary resources to get there.
In the years following that meeting, our team worked hard, and we encountered many doubters but we continued to invest with a long view and last year's results showed the value of that focus. And as we sit here today, we remain committed to making future investments with that same long view. Rather than sitting back, taking a break and waiting for the virus to subside, we are focused on playing offense and investing in continued growth. 
And just like 4 years ago, my confidence in the future starts with the team. So I want to acknowledge everyone on the Target team, from headquarters to our distribution centers, to our stores in all 50 states and our offices around the world for their dedication to our guests and passion for taking care of each other. Without you, we couldn't have delivered such an amazing amount of value on behalf of our stakeholders in 2020. And with your help, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead. I can't say it enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks."

As we wind down today's event, I'll leave you with a couple of thoughts. 5 years ago, we envisioned a future for ourselves, in which the key to guest preference and breakout growth lay in an unappreciated omnichannel asset called the store. Many were skeptical, which is why we said from the beginning that we were playing our own game and creating a category of one. Many thought the inevitable drift was for our store guests to become digital guests, and that the current only ran in 1 direction.
We saw something different. We saw a future in which even the most committed digital-only guests would find the best and easiest shopping experience at Target because of how we connect that experience to our stores. We knew that to make our stores function for the future that we envisioned, we'd have to build, acquire and bundle a unique set of capabilities. The technology, the supply chain inventiveness, the physical assets and operations and the team of trusted neighbors that millions turn to for friendly service and a bit of everyday joy.  
We began to put all those pieces together like no one else had. And the experience was taking hold, on the timetable we expected. Then 2020 accelerated everything. And today, Target is as synonymous with same-day and safety as it is with style and swagger. That is a very strong position to be in.
And here's where we intend to go with it. First, we'll continue to focus on market share over the long term. We believe our experience, including our fulfillment options, inspiring assortment, ease, safety and personal service will convert more and more consumers into guests. And we'll also work tirelessly to engage established guests across more of our channels and offerings. With new guests choosing Target and established guests engaging with more of our platform, we'll be able to listen to them even more closely. And capabilities like Drive Up, Shipt and Circle will give us a wider window than ever into their preferences. Meaning, we can further improve the experience we provide in the near term, while continuously anticipating where we should go next.  
Staying closely connected to our guests always points us in the right direction. That's what helped us see a future 5 years ago, that today is a reality. And it's why we're stepping up our investments to drive additional profitable growth. Unlike in recent years, when we needed to shore up our foundation or create new capabilities, today's investments will build on an omnichannel Target platform that is already working incredibly well. A platform that has raised expectations, not just among Target guests, but for consumers across U.S. retail. Few can meet those expectations like we can because what we've created is based on a unique combination of differentiated assets.  
But this is just the beginning of our story on which we'll continue to iterate, innovate and continuously improve for our guests. So in closing, I want to express my complete confidence in this company's future. I'm confident in our strategy and in our capabilities. And above all, I'm confident in our team. They know that no platform succeeds without purpose. And that our ambitions are always informed by the millions of families we serve. The results we're sharing today and what we envision for the future simply wouldn't be possible without the best team in the business. And I want to thank them once again for all they do for Target, our guests and communities.
Finally, I want to thank you for joining our Financial Community Meeting. We appreciate your interest in Target, your engagement in our journey and your long-term investment in a growth horizon that we believe will remain bright for years to come. We look forward to hearing from you in the Q&A portion of our program.

But as we sit here today, I think we all recognize this is a very uncertain environment. We're still speculating around what's going to happen with the economy, how employment rates start to recover. While the trends are encouraging right now with the virus, we're all battling COVID each and every day. And while vaccine distribution is accelerating, millions and millions of Americans are still waiting for their turn to get that vaccine. We're still wondering when children go back to school. And when we'll return to the workplace. 
So we approach guidance, recognizing there's lots of uncertainty. But I'll go back to the fact that for most of the last year, we haven't provided guidance, but we have focused on execution. And I think our team has proven to be very flexible, very agile. We responded to the environment and we've been focused on delivering a trusted and safe experience for our guests, whether they're shopping in our stores or online. That focus on execution will continue in 2021. And I wouldn't confuse guidance or the lack thereof with our confidence to continue to take market share and outperform in the coming months and years.
So I recognize the frustration of not being more precise, particularly on the top line as we think about sales, but I can guarantee you, our entire leadership team and every part of this organization is focused on retaining and growing market share no matter what the variables are we have to face. So I recognize, and we certainly like to be in a different position today, providing more precision. But what I can tell you is we're going to continue to execute our strategy, leverage our capabilities, our owned brands and national brands, our multi-category assortment and our team to continue to build on the momentum we gained in 2020, leverage the additional $15 billion of revenue we now have inside of our P&L and continue to build on the market share we gained in 2020 and make sure that's very sticky for years to come. 
But I recognize for all of you, you'd love more precision around market share. You'd love some more top line insights. I can tell you, we're off to a very strong start in February. In fact, our comps in February started with a 2 handle, and that's a 20 comp in the first part of the year.
So we'll see how that plays out in March and April, but we're off to a strong start. We took significant market share in the fourth quarter. If you recall our comments in earlier meetings, we talked about the fact that in the first 3 quarters of the year, we had picked up approximately $6 billion of market share. So we added another $3 billion of market share during the holiday season, where all of our competitors were operating. So I think the vibrancy of our model, our ability to execute is something that I would ask all of you to focus in on. And I recognize you've got to do that in light of the fact that we haven't provided the precision that we normally do at this time."

If you would have told us we could double the digital business and only see 110 basis points of pressure last year, I think we all would have taken that outcome. But more important than that, when we're growing digital, we're deepening our relationship with guests. And great things happen in aggregate to us when that occurs. 
And so sign me up for more digital growth going forward. We know that's a behavior that will be sticky. Because what comes with that, in addition to a little bit of rate pressure on the margin line, is hugely accretive sales benefits in total. And so biggest driver in 2021 for sure and I would welcome more digital growth going forward and we expect that's a place where we'll continue to excel."

They gained market share, very strong results for the business serving our retail partners. And just as important, and I'll come back to this, is Shipt has become an integral part of Target and our fulfillment on same-day operations. So incredibly important there. But I think the team down in Birmingham did an outstanding job this year, just scaling the business, right? They doubled the number of shoppers. We talked about how the Target sales on Shipt grew by 300%. Memberships grew by 130%. We continue to add great retail partners like Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond and several local and regional grocers. And so they've done just a really great job continuing to scale that business. 
I think when it comes to Shipt and obviously, the relationship with Target, incredibly important part about our same-day options. And you heard us talk all morning today about the key lever that having that suite of fulfillment, same-day fulfillment options for our Target guest has been over the past year and really over the past several years and will continue to be in the future. Not only is that the preferred way our guest continues to grow with us, but they're also economically advantaged. And so we see -- we continue to see huge opportunities for Shipt to continue to work directly with Target to continue to fulfill our guest's needs. 
The other thing I would say, is we see when a -- very similar to Drive Up, when a guest engages with Shipt through Target, again, we see growth in our sales in-store and online on the Target platform as well. So they get more engaged with Target. That is hugely valuable for us. So we bought that capability 3 years ago thinking this is what it would be. It would be incredibly important for us from a same-day perspective. It has only become more so has that accelerated through 2020."

At that time, we said the most important investment we were making was in our team. And I think the results we've seen in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020, is a by-product of that commitment to our team. Investing in wages and benefits, investing in training and career opportunities. And I think it's allowed us to build the best team in retail that's incredibly engaged, that's focused on taking care of our guests, but also taking care of each other. And our team was really the star of 2020. They stepped up during the pandemic and made sure we created a safe shopping environment. 
As we scale Drive Up and saw growth rates of 500% or 600%, they flexed and we're able to meet the needs of the guests. So I think the fact that we've taken a leadership position with wages, invested in our team, provided them the opportunities to grow their careers, that's a hallmark of the commitment we've made at Target to creating the best team in retail. And I think it's provided great returns on investments for shareholders. So we'll continue to make sure we invest in our team. 
To your question around design, the investments we've made in food and beverage, Good & Gather is off to a tremendous start, a multibillion-dollar brand in a short period of time. It's been well received by our guests, great quality, had a great value. And I think it typifies the things we do with our owned brands. And we're very excited about the momentum we had in food and beverage. We took significant market share throughout the year. And the guest has certainly recognized and appreciates the Good & Gather brand. So we think that's a way for us to continue to differentiate our offerings. And as John mentioned, we'll continue to add fresh products to our Drive Up assortment and Pick Up assortment throughout the year, providing our guests access to more of those products that they're looking for each and every day."

So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt",422,"Scott, I think on fulfillment costs, we continue to make progress on our fulfillment costs through 2 paths. First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it. So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt today, ship-from-store, all of those are cheaper than they were 2 years ago. So we continue to see our costs come down there. 
The second way we see our costs come down is through mix. Drive Up, Order Pick Up and Shipt all have much better economics, as we've said for years than shipping from the back of our stores, which also has better economics than shipping from our fulfillment centers. So we -- and they are the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio. In addition to that, ship-from-store grows much faster than fulfillment. So we see favorable mix as well. So we continue to be really pleased with the progress we're making on the unit economics of shipping or delivering goods, fulfilling goods to our guests.
The only thing I might add to that is, I mean, John talked about the power of having stores hit the hub of that fulfillment equation, and that helps all those marginal economics. But also important not to forget is the thing that matters most economically with digital is the growth in guest spend in total as they become those omnichannel guests that have a deeper relationship with Target overall. 
And so any time we're looking at the slice and dicing of the P&L by channel, which we do a lot of, and we've made a lot of progress getting more efficient over time, that always has to be stapled to the greater impact of that greater guest spend in total as they use more and more of our digital fulfillment services. 
Scott, one of the examples we've shared over the last year is the Target guest that is now using Drive Up, actually spends more money in store. It just deepens that relationship. So we can look at the economics, fulfillment node by fulfillment node, but it's really how it all comes together and how we deepen relationship with our guests, get them to use all of our assets and utilize both stores and digital fulfillment channels over time. So as John said, we're going to continue to improve the economics of each one of those capabilities but it's really the sum of the parts and that deeper relationship we build as our guests use more of our fulfillment nodes over time."

And that helps us on the cost question that you asked. It's cheaper to ship a box a shorter distance from a local store after it's ridden our supply chain rails all the way to that store. Same-day fulfillment economics look a lot like store economics to us. And that's the piece to John's point that's growing fastest. And so the stores give us an incredible advantage to have advantaged cost profile as we fulfill. 
The other thing that the stores give us that has been incredibly valuable this year is great flexibility. We've seen the ability for stores to scale to meet guests' need in a way that I think probably would have surprised us if we can go back a year in time and see it all coming. But stores are so flexible. There's real power in being able to say, it's that same piece of inventories sitting on a shelf, and we can put it in a box and ship it out the back. We can drop it in a guest's trunk via a Drive Up. They can place it in their cart on a store trip and not having to be able to see perfectly exactly how that demand is going to come, but knowing the inventory can fulfill it and our great store team can make it happen however the guest chooses to shop gives us a huge flexibility advantage as well."

So the other thing that we've talked about periodically is the importance of mix in our business. And over time, our multi-category portfolio is a huge asset. Christina has been obviously in a merchant chair for a number of years and understands the importance of balancing our multi-category portfolio, the balance between our owned brands and national brands. And as John and Michael have talked about periodically, as we think about the future from a digital standpoint, we think that's going to continue to move more and more towards same-day, which from a mix standpoint is very advantageous to us. So I think our outlook for margin over the long-term is very bullish. 
As we leverage our multi-category portfolio, we continue to build our owned brands as well as great national brand partners.

And to Christina's point, they're looking for the opportunity to shop our stores and find new items. They're tired of the yoga pants and really appreciate some of the new assortment we have in apparel. They're still shopping for their homes as they refresh the core. They're still heating at home so kitchen and food-related items are still really important. 
So we see a guest shopping all of our categories, taking advantage of both stores and our digital channels. And I think it's a byproduct of the investments we've made throughout the pandemic to build trust to make sure they know we've got a safe shopping environment and the great work that our teams have done to make sure that they're focused every day on meeting the needs to our guests.

We're encouraged to see the stickiness of a lot of the new behaviors that were tried in 2020. 
So things like Drive Up, thanks to the incredible experience our store teams provide. Once guests try a service like that, they come back and we've seen higher rates of stickiness this year than historically for some of those digital fulfillment services. And that bodes well for the stickiness of those guests and those behaviors going forward. And so while we do watch new guests, and it's great to get a new guest and convert them to a deeper Target guests over time, a lot of America shops Target and it's the deepening of those existing guests as they shop us in new and different ways and more often, that's our focus."

The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growt",1383,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 
The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growth and healing. From our unique mix of categories, to our unmatched set of fulfillment options, our business is delivering what consumers want and need each and every day. 
The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%. Maintaining that pace this quarter was especially notable, given that we were comping over double-digit growth a year ago. Over the last 2 years, comp sales have grown about 36%. And total sales expanded by $6.5 billion in the first quarter alone. This year's sales growth reflected more than $1 billion in market share gains, a clear signal of how relevant guests find our experience even though they have many more shopping options available compared with this time last year. 
In a quarter featuring many things to celebrate, I'm most proud of the performance of our stores. With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out. We've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping. Guests are happy to come back to our stores because they love the environment we've created and invested in over time. As a result, our store comp sales increased 18% in Q1, driven almost entirely by higher traffic and accounting for the vast majority of our growth. Contrast that to a year ago when the channel mix of our business was changing rapidly, with guests leaning heavily into our digital fulfillment options, essentially our same-day services in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. A year ago on this call, we were highlighting a digital comp of 141%, driven by growth in our same-day services of more than 275%. These 2 contrasting scenarios clearly demonstrate the flexibility of our operating model. But they also show how our stores and digital channels complement each other to drive guest engagement. 
Even though digital stole the headlines a year ago, our store comps actually increased about 1% in the first quarter last year. And this year, while store sales accounted for most of our growth, first quarter digital comp sales also grew 50%, on top of last year's enormous numbers. This is the power of, guests turn to Target because of our source and our digital options, not one versus the other. And for us, the distinction between a store sale and a digital sale is largely irrelevant. Because of our unique stores as hub model, more than 3/4 of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. That means, in total, more than 95% of Target's first quarter sales were driven by our store assets, store inventory and store teams. 
This store-driven growth is translating to outstanding bottom line performance. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.69 established a new all-time high for the company. Compared to 2020 when profitability took a temporary dip. this year's performance represents an astounding increase more than sixfold. If we look back to first quarter, this year's adjusted EPS was more than 140% higher, demonstrating how far our business has advanced in a short time. 
I want to pause here and thank our team members across the world. They have consistently demonstrated incredible passion, commitment and focus to serve our guests and take care of each other. I am grateful and proud to serve with this outstanding team and to share the incredible business results they're delivering quarter after quarter. 
It's also important to highlight how the category mix plays a key role in the flexibility of our model. For instance, with guests venturing out, we've seen an incredible rebound in apparel sales, with Q1 comp growth of more than 60%. On the other hand, and as expected, we experienced lower growth in Food, Beverages and Essentials, as we annualized the peak stock-up period a year ago. Most notably, we saw continued strength in our home and hardlines categories, which delivered outsized growth on top of very strong numbers a year ago. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. 
A relentless focus on operational excellence is another key factor in our performance. This is best summarized by our guest satisfaction scores, which across all of our services have remained stable or moved higher despite record growth that's now compounding on a 2-year basis. This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pickup, Drive-Up and ship have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth, and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter. 
Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than 1/3 of our digital sales. While all [ 3 ] same-day services continue to grow faster than overall digital, Drive-Up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago, and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year. Put another way, in the first quarter alone, Drive-Up sales have grown by well over $1 billion in the last 2 years. As John will outline in more detail, we continue to expand the assortment available for Drive-Up, and we've earmarked capital investments to make Drive-Up even more convenient for our guests and efficient for our team, given that we anticipate continued rapid growth of this service. 
While it's gratifying to see what our team has accomplished over the last several years, there is much more opportunity in front of us. We're planning significant investments in our store assets, as we remodel hundreds more locations, roll out new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, invest in the efficiency of our same-day services, and enter new neighborhood by opening new small- and medium-sized stores. We're also investing in our brand portfolio, as we focus on presenting the best owned and national brands to our guests, which we highlight through the best in-store and digital shopping experience in the market. We're also making continued investments in safety and cleanliness, reinforcing the trust and confidence we've already established with our guests. And we continue to invest in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and advancement, to ensure that Target continues to be a destination for top talent. And as you've seen from many of our recent announcements, we're investing to leverage our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families. 
This summer, we'll share more information about our refreshed enterprise sustainability strategy that further draws on our company legacy of corporate responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. As part of our immediate efforts, we'll focus on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity in all communities, all in service to a safe and prosperous future for all. 
It was 4 years ago, at the beginning of 2017, that we first announced our plan to double down on investments and growth. The decisions we announced that day and the investments we made in the intervening years left us well prepared to handle all the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. 
In the first quarter of 2017, our business generated sales of just over $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.21. 4 years later, first quarter sales have grown nearly 50% and adjusted earnings per share have tripled. 
From today's vantage point, the opportunities ahead of us, both this year and over time, are just as bright as they were on that day 4 years ago. Despite what's already been accomplished, we've only scratched the surface of what this brand and this team can accomplish over time. I'm excited to stand with them as we write the next chapter in this great company's history. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cristina, who will share more perspective on our first quarter results and for priorities going forward. Christina?"

As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes",1803,"Thanks, Brian. 
As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes for our sales, both by category and in total. And so far, with one quarter behind us, results have been extremely positive across every dimension. 
In the face of this strength, we've seen an incredible response from our teams across the board, from our stores, to our merchants, to the supply chain, who all worked together in service of our guests. While there are many ways to measure the impact of those efforts, guest loyalty and market share are the 2 most important measures of success in this volatile time. 
Consequently, it's incredibly gratifying to see that across every one of our guest segments in the first quarter, we measured an increase in average trips per guest and a larger average basket. This led to more than $1 billion of additional market share in the quarter, on top of $1 billion gain a year ago. 
In terms of category performance, we saw the strongest growth in our apparel business, which delivered comp growth in the low 60% range. As Brian mentioned, we saw a temporary dip in apparel sales last year, when first quarter comps were down around 20%. Following this year's strong increase, first quarter apparel sales have grown approximately 29% over the last 2 years. 
Home also delivered incredible growth with an increase in the mid-30% range, on top of a high single-digit increase a year ago. Within Home, growth was strong across the board, with the most robust performance in our decorative home and seasonal businesses. 
Hardlines also delivered huge volume, with comp growth above 30%, on top of a 20% increase a year ago. Results were led by sporting goods and toys, which both saw comps above 40%. 
Beauty comp in the high teens, on top of a high single-digit growth a year ago. Within Beauty, the skin care, sun care and bath categories delivered comp growth in the mid-30% range, with cosmetics growing in the low 20s. 
Finally, our essentials and food categories both delivered comps in the low to mid-single digits. 
To see healthy growth on top of last year is remarkable. As you'll recall that a year ago, guests were aggressively stocking up their pantries, fridges and freezers. And we sold virtually every unit of paper goods that we owned. 
Beyond category strength, I want to pause and also highlight that sales on Target's own brands grew approximately 36% in the first quarter, the strongest increase we've ever recorded. Because of our unique capabilities in product design, development and sourcing, our own brand products offer an unbeatable combination of design, quality and value. These brands aren't something that our guests pick up while they're at Target, their big reason why they shop at Target, which is why we continue to invest in them. 
We frequently talk about performance by category and our brands because it's important that our entire portfolio is healthy and well positioned to meet our guest needs. But it's also important to realize that they create value for our guests beyond simply the sum of the parts. Rather, it's the combination of all our offerings, including categories, brands and services across our distinct multichannel experience, that allows Target to serve our guest needs today and over time. 
Last year, as guests focused more on enjoying time at home, that had implications not just for our home category, but also for hardlines, food and beverage and essentials. And their focus on health and well-being affected trends in activewear, beauty, health care, food and beverage and more. 
The same is true for our sales channels. As guests last year focused on social distancing, they leaned into digital, including our same-day services. And this year, as they're looking to get back out in public, they're flocking to our stores, based on the trust we established over time, which was further reinforced by last year's investments. 
So as we plan the remainder of the year, both in total and by category, we continue to listen closely to our guests to understand how they're thinking and feeling. And when we talk to our guests today, they tell us they want to maintain some of the new habits and routines they formed during the pandemic, including an enhanced focus on the joy of home and health and well-being of their family. 
At the same time, there's a rapidly emerging emphasis on style and mobility, as guests feel increasingly safe in public spaces. That trend is playing out in an explosive demand for dresses and cosmetics as well as luggage and categories based on being active like sporting goods and Performance Activewear. This reinforces the concept of and, Target can fulfill our guest needs as they focus on home and health and when they look to venture out. We can welcome them back into our stores and continue to serve them with the same-day services they've recently tried and now love. 
So after a record-setting first quarter, we're keeping our foot on the gas, based on our guests desire to bring rejuvenated life and energy to their homes, celebrate seasonal moments with loved ones and step out in public. I could not be more excited about the ways we're ready to inspire and energize our guests. 
Just last week, we launched our latest limited-time collection, Hilton Carter for Target. Off to a great start, this collection features live plants, foe greenery and unique plant accessories for experienced and novice gardeners alike. Not to be outdone by their parents, younger kids want to make their spaces their own. And our popular kids brand, Pillowfort, will continue to help them do just that. For its 5-year anniversary, Pillowfort is celebrating with hundreds of new items that can grow with them and be used in any area of the house. 
As our guests begin stepping out, they're focused on looking and feeling their best. With this rekindled passion for fashion, Our guests will be overjoyed with the latest installment of our designer dress collection. Featuring designs by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rico, this assortment offers more than 70 original and affordable dresses in bold, bright patterns and statement silhouettes. And of course, with our continued focus on inclusivity and celebrating everybody, this collection features affordable prices in a range of sizes from extra extra small to [ 4x. ] 
We've long focused on making Target a destination for holidays and life events, and we just wrapped up a huge Mother's Day season. We had solutions for mom across the store, from apparel, gifting, beauty, flowers, candy and more. And now we're gearing up for Father's Day in June. We've got a great assortment of gifts for dad, from all in motion a tire for golfing, hitting the gym or just hanging out, to a line of shave, skin care and hair care products from Good fellow. 
Of course, June celebrations aren't exclusive to that. With so many in-person celebrations canceled last year, we're ecstatic about our fabulous new assortment for Pride as we celebrate love with our LGBTQIA guests, team members and neighbors. 
Later in the summer, we know families are excited to celebrate the 4th of July with a long-awaited neighborhood Cookout a road trip out of town or an intimate backyard barbecue with a few fireworks. 
With great deals on the perfect owned and national brand assortments, it doesn't matter if the celebration is big or small, Target is everything you'll need to fill a cooler, pack a beach bag and fill up with friends, family and fun. 
And before we know it, it's time to head back to school, and we're planning for one of our biggest back-to-school and college seasons ever. Of course, we'll have great deals on all the traditional school supplies, but we'll also have the new normals on the school supply list, like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. With local school lists on target.com and our industry-leading fulfillment options, back-to-school shopping has never been safer or easier. And with the great new apparel offerings from Cat & Jack, Art Class, More than Magic, Wild Fabled original use and all in motion, all found only at Target, we'll have our school down guests looking and feeling fresh for that first day of school. 
Before I close, I want to pause and highlight some of the work I'm most passionate about, and that's our work on Target's Reach Committee, which we formed last year to achieve lasting systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities. This work aligns with our vision for sustainability at Target, and it's a strong example of how we're becoming an equitable company, creating change that strengthens our business. 
Hopefully, you've seen our recent announcement that Target is committed to spending more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. In addition, we've announced a new scholarship program to support students and more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities. And this summer, both in-store and online, we are adding more items to our Black Beyond measure assortment. I'm so proud of these efforts and everything we do to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. 
I also want to give a quick shout out to our store teams. I recently had a chance to visit stores in the New York City market. And after more than a year in which most of my meetings have been virtual, it was an incredibly energizing experience. I visited new small-format locations across the city, from Manhattan, to Queens, to Brooklyn. Every location was a unique reflection of the local neighborhood, from design, to assortment, and the team members serving their neighbors. Based on the energy and passion I could feel from these teams, it's clear why we're seeing such strong sales in our stores across the country. 
As the first Chief Growth Officer at Target, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunities still ahead of us. As you saw throughout 2020 and now in 2021, we have a long runway to continue investing in and growing our core business. At the same time, we'll continue to develop innovation pipelines and explore new initiatives, maintaining a balance between fundamentals and execution and the exploration of new opportunities. As we plan for future growth, we'll continue to listen to our guests and apply those insights to prioritize their work. With this guest first approach, we're confident we can continue to build relevance and market share, both today and over time. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4",1200,"Thanks, Christina. 
At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5 billion of sales in the first quarter. Given this continued rapid growth and the opportunities still ahead of us, the operations team is focused on building capacity and enhancing processes to create and enable Target's continued growth. That work starts in our supply chain, where we've outlined our plans to add 4 new regional distribution centers by the end of 2022, with the first 2 buildings slated to open later this year. These new buildings located in Chicago and New Jersey are set to go live in the next several months, creating additional capacity for the network in total, while enhancing service levels in high-volume markets that continue to grow. More specifically, once these buildings are operating at scale, they'll meaningfully shorten lead times to nearby stores, improving in-stock levels, while reducing the need for safety stock in those locations. 
Beyond the capacity we're adding with these new buildings, we're also investing in updated fixtures to create additional capacity across our current network. These changes are highly capital efficient, involving a small amount of capital to open up a substantial amount of incremental capacity within the network, equivalent to the addition of about 1.5 new distribution centers. 
And as we told you at our meeting in March, we're pleased with the initial results from our new sortation center in Minneapolis. As a result, we have plans to build up to 5 more of these facilities in 2021, with additional openings planned for 2022 and beyond. We're opening these centers which are smaller than an average store in markets with a high concentration of local package delivery. They're designed to receive and sort packages from a large group of surrounding stores multiple times a day, which allows for more optimized granular sortation. This precision reduces costs for our delivery partners, meaningfully reducing what we pay for delivery. In addition, these facilities eliminate the need for sortation with the stores they serve, while freeing up packing capacity at those same locations. 
Sort centers have long been on our fulfillment road map, which we've built through internal development along with small acquisitions. In these facilities, we optimize the selection of delivery partners by applying technology from Grand Junction, which we acquired in 2017. And we optimize sortation to minimize costs to increase speed by applying technology we acquired from Deliv in 2020. 
In addition, beginning in the first quarter, our Minneapolis sort center began testing package delivery using Ship, another 2017 acquisition, to add capacity, reduce costs and enable more, flexibility, which will benefit our rapidly growing ship-from-store capability over time. 
Within our store network, we've begun ramping up our remodel program, following the pause we implemented last year. We have just over 34 remodels slated for completion in the second quarter and more than 100 planned for the back half of the year. Based on past experience, we expect these remodeled stores will generate an incremental 2% to 4% sales growth in the year following completion, with another 2% incremental growth in the second year. Beyond the direct impact on sales, these transformations create an ideal platform for all of the merchandise innovations and service enhancements that we'll launch over time. 
In addition to full store remodels, we're planning other store investments this year, including more than 100 Ulta shop-in-shops, slated to launch in the back half of the year, as well as our enhanced Apple layout in Electronics in select stores across the country. 
Among our store services, we've long known that our same-day fulfillment options would be popular with our guests. But their growth over the last few years has been far above our expectations. This is most evident in our Drive-Up service where first quarter sales volume was nearly 21x higher than it was 2 years ago, amounting to nearly $1.3 billion of incremental sales volume over that period. In the face of this incredible growth, there are emerging opportunities in high-volume locations to invest in capacity and efficiency in support of our same-day services. 
Specifically, in more than 100 locations this year, we're investing in small projects to optimize the front ends of these buildings, freeing up additional capacity for continued same-day growth, while making the layout more efficient and safer for the team. 
We also continue to enhance the assortments available for all 3 same-day services, adding more perishable food to our pickup and Drive-Up services and more general merchandise like apparel to the assortment available through ship. And we just announced that in the second quarter, we'll have adult beverages available through pickup and/or Drive-Up in more than 1,200 stores and available for same-day delivery in more than 600 stores across the country. 
Beyond activity in existing stores, we're expanding our new store opening plans to more than 30 additional locations across the country this year, as we continue to find compelling opportunities in urban and dense suburban markets and on our near college campuses. In recent years, these custom formats have typically been less than 50,000 square feet. However, given local real estate conditions in dense suburban markets, we're also finding compelling opportunities to open somewhat bigger stores, between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, which weren't available in the past. As a group, these new stores are generating higher-than-average sales productivity, above average gross margin rates and strong financial returns. And we see a very long runway to open more of them over time. 
And finally, after store comp growth of 18% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by traffic, we're confident that we're already benefiting from a differentiated service model in our stores. But that's a lead we can't take for granted. So we're continually looking for ways to get even better. So this year, our store teams are rolling out an enhanced service model, focused on consistency of every interaction to ensure that our guests will always feel welcomed and appreciated. And if they need help, there will be team members who can find solutions to enhance their experience. This new engagement model is strongly connected to our company purpose, culture and values. And we're supporting it with enhanced training and tools across the chain. It's designed not to be a one-and-done effort, but a sustainable model that's integrated with our operational goals, not something separate that's added on to everyday tasks. 
So as I turn it over to Michael, I want to once again thank the entire team for the incredible things you've already done and your passion to continually raise the bar. This year, I'm celebrating my 25th year at Target. So you might be tempted to think I've seen it all. But when I step back and realize what this team has accomplished in the last year, under the most challenging of circumstances, it's clear that there is no limit to this team's potential, and there's no doubt that we have the best team in retail. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."
174438,706476635,2292121,"Target Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters.

When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. 
On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more than offset all of the unique headwinds we faced over this challenging period, resulting in really strong performance. 
Target's total sales grew 23.3% in the first quarter, reflecting comp growth of 22.9%. Given last year's double-digit growth, first quarter sales have expanded more than 37% over the last 2 years, driven almost entirely by higher comps. Unlike last year, when consumers were consolidating trips and shopping less often, this year's comp growth was driven primarily by a traffic increase of more than 17% combined with a 5% increase in average ticket. 
As Brian mentioned, store comps were the growth engine this year, while digital was the primary driver in Q1 2020. As such, over the last 2 years, both our stores and digital channels have expanded their first quarter sales by more than $3 billion. This balance highlights the relevance and complementary nature of both channels in serving our guest needs. 
Our first quarter gross margin rate of 30% was 490 basis points ahead of last year, when we faced a number of temporary headwinds, including markdowns and other costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. Compared with 2019, this year's first quarter gross margin rate was about 40 basis points higher, which is notable given the digital sales penetration more than doubled in that time, from 7.1% in 2019 to more than 18% this year. 
In terms of the year-over-year gross margin drivers, mix had a positive impact of about 150 basis points, reflecting the dramatic increase in apparel sales and continued strength in our home category. The remaining favorability was driven by core merchandising, as we continued to benefit from low promotional and clearance markdown rates. And we annualized last year's costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. The rate impact of supply chain and digital fulfillment costs was approximately neutral compared to last year, as the costs of outsized digital growth were offset by the benefit of a stronger mix of same-day fulfillment and our ongoing work to control unit costs across our entire suite of digital fulfillment options. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 18.6% this year, down more than 2 percentage points from 20.7% a year ago and 20.8% in 2019. In terms of drivers, leverage benefits have more than offset all of the extra costs we've absorbed over the last 2 years, including meaningfully higher pay and benefits for our team and other investments to protect the health and safety of our team and guests. 
While D&A expenses have grown in each of the last 2 years, this year's first quarter D&A expense rate was about 40 basis points lower than a year ago and about 80 basis points lower than 2019. 
All together, our first quarter operating margin rate increased an astounding 7.4 percentage points compared with a year ago to an unprecedented 9.8% this year, from a temporary low of 2.4% rate a year ago. However, even compared to a very healthy 6.4% operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2019, this year's rate was more than 3 percentage points higher. 
In terms of dollars, first quarter operating income has more than doubled over the last 2 years. 
On the bottom line, our business delivered first quarter GAAP EPS of $4.17, up more than 600% from a year ago and well over double our 2019 GAAP EPS. On the adjusted EPS line, which excluded the gain from the sale of our Derm store business, we earned $3.69 this year, more than 500% higher than a year ago and well over double our 2019 adjusted EPS. 
As you know, our capital deployment priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we returned cash through our quarterly dividend, which we've maintained every quarter as a public company and grown every year since 1971. And finally, we returned excess cash over time through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A debt ratings. 
In the first quarter, we invested just over $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business. We continue to expect our full year CapEx will be approximately $4 billion, but the bulk of those expenditures will be more backloaded in the year, given the timing of this year's projects. 
We paid dividends of $340 million in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago, as growth in the per share dividend was partially offset by a decline in share count. 
And finally, we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, following a temporary pause in 2020, and deployed about $1.2 billion to retire 6.1 million shares at an average share price of just under $191. 
And in February, we completed the sale of our Derm store business, which contributed just over $350 million to our first quarter cash flow. 
All together, we ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. This was down about $700 million from the beginning of the quarter, but still well above where we expect to operate over time. With this cash, we'll be funding approximately $3.5 billion of additional CapEx in 2021 and will be recommending a robust increase in our quarterly dividends to the Board later this year. Beyond these uses, we should have ample capacity for continued share repurchases. And we'll continue to govern the magnitude and pace of repurchases in support of our goal to maintain our Middle A credit ratings. And given where we are today, it will likely be a multiyear journey before our debt metrics move fully back to where they've been over time. 
Now I'd like to turn briefly to our return on invested capital, which reflects both our operating results and the investments we've made to generate them. 
In the first quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC moved up to 30.7%, which is well over double the 13.4% we reported a year ago. While we've indicated that this measure will likely be volatile in the near term and could revert to a very healthy number, near 20% over time, the fact that our business has generated such a high after-tax return over the last 12 months is a testament both to the strength of our model and outstanding execution by our team. 
Now let me turn to our sales outlook. We learned a lot in the first quarter, and notably, got our first look at how our business is successfully comping the comp, with impressive growth on top of last year's strong surge in sales. Also, and importantly, we've continued to gain market share on top of last year's dramatic share gains. Based on these results, we're now planning for our business to deliver a mid- to high single-digit comp increase in the second quarter. This expectation is in line with the 2-year growth rates we saw in the first quarter. And while we only have a couple of weeks in the quarter behind us, the results we've seen so far this month are consistent with this outlook. 
The range for second quarter operating income remains wide, but should remain strong, far ahead of our 2019 rate of 7.2%, but perhaps not fully as high as last year's unprecedented rate of 10%. 
In terms of the specific puts and takes in the quarter, we'll be comping over last year's reversal of the return reserve estimate, which added about $110 million to last year's operating income. In addition, this year, we're making purposeful investments in store labor hours to ensure we deliver outstanding service and stronger in-stocks than a year ago, when sales grew far beyond our expectations. Of course, we'll continue to benefit from meaningful sales leverage, given that we're planning for healthy growth, on top of last year's record-setting increase. Putting that all together, we expect to see continued strong performance on this line. 
In the back half of the year, the range of possibilities for comp growth is also quite wide, and we'll gain more insights as the year progresses. As of today, based on our recent results and confidence going forward, we expect to see positive single-digit comps in the back half of the year, on top of last year's unprecedented performance. 
Regarding our full year operating margin rate, following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we have increasing confidence in the consumer and industry backdrop in the back half of the year. As such, the range of outcomes for our 2021 operating margin rate has moved significantly higher. So despite the anticipated headwind from higher markdown rates following last year's historically low rates, we believe that our business is positioned to deliver a full year operating margin rate that's well over last year's rate of 7%. More specifically, we believe this year's operating margin rate could reach 8% or perhaps a little higher. We'll continue to refine our view throughout the year. 
As the team looks ahead to the rest of the year, they're focused on staying agile in what continues to be a volatile environment. Rather than placing all of their bets on a single forecast number, they're focused on contingency planning, creating flexibility that will allow us to react to unexpected changes, and importantly, take advantage of opportunity when we see it. 
We're also excited about the investments still ahead of us and the growth they'll create: hundreds more remodels, dozens of new stores, new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, and supply chain investments to support both replenishment and fulfillment. Given the performance we're seeing today, which is the product of the investments we've made over the last few years, we're eagerly leading into future opportunities to enable more profitable, high-return growth over time. 
Before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to add my voice and thanks to the team. The value our team members are creating for our business, communities, shareholders and each other goes far beyond what we can measure in a P&L. Thanks for making Target an even stronger company on behalf of all of our stakeholders.

I'm thankful for their continued focus on our guests, focus on operational excellence and passion for our brand. I also want to acknowledge the challenges facing our India headquarter team, along with our team members who have family there, given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We have been carefully monitoring conditions on the ground and providing extra support to our team during this difficult time to ensure they can take care of themselves and their families. We've also funded $500,000 donation to UNICEF set to increase access to option treatment in hospitals across the country and bring testing resources to the hardest hit communities. We're hopeful that conditions there will continue to improve. 
So now as we get ready to move to your questions, I want to underscore the confidence you've heard throughout our remarks today. 
Coming off an unbelievable year in 2020, we had a lot of confidence as we enter 2021. But our first quarter results came in far ahead of our baseline expectations. With the macro and consumer backdrop that's been surprisingly positive, we've seen remarkable momentum in our performance, even as we started to comp over the period of peak increases a year ago. The flexibility of our category mix and fulfillment options, combined with an agile, energetic and engaged team, continue to resonate with our guests, driving double-digit traffic growth and an increase in average tickets in the first quarter. 
But as you've often heard me say, we shouldn't confuse performance with potential. So even after more than a year of unprecedented growth, we're seeing focus and leaning into the opportunities ahead of us, making investments to build on an already strong foundation. With these investments, I'm confident that our business model and outstanding team will continue to raise the bar on an already best-in-class retail experience, resulting in even stronger loyalty and guest engagement over time. 
With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions."

Joy at home and the opportunity to celebrate everything that brings the guests to their home, eating, being with their families, and the investments that they've made over time in their home, health and well-being, the opportunities that our guests are taking to invest in proactive health care and fitness at home and activewear. And then the newer and more emerging trend is really style and mobility. As guests are going out, they are looking for a fresh look.

As you know well, we've talked about stores as hubs now for -- going on 4 years. And we have always said, we like it for a couple of reasons. One, great guest service, and 2, better economics. Same-day services are that on steroids. They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home, because, as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home. So if we take that out of the equation, then we end up with economics that are much closer to the store transaction. 
The thing we love about all of the same-day services, pick up, Drive-Up and Ship, all of them continue to grow faster than our overall digital growth, and we continue to find ways to improve them, as you said. Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store so that we don't end up with what we call I&F or items not found. And then we continue to invest in helping them physically. And that's a big focus for us this year and will be over the next couple of years. 
In the case of Drive-Up, which as we've talked about a couple of times, Brian talked about and I talked about, has been our fastest-growing same-day service since -- basically since we started it. It also has our highest NPS score, so guests love it. We let you decide when you want to come. We don't force you into a time slot. And then our team brings it out to you in 2 minutes or less. So our guests absolutely love that. And you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. 
Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature control products to Drive-Up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well. 
So every year, our team comes up with multiple ways to continue to improve the service, first and foremost, for the guest, and then on the back end, improve things for our team so they can execute it easier as we continue to grow. So we see a lot more opportunity for us. And as I said, that will be a big part of our capital investment over the next several years."

And there's still a wide range of where those numbers might ultimately land, and we'll continue to refine our point of view as the year progresses. But scale is a wonderful thing.

When it comes to markdowns through the balance of the year, we've talked about this a little bit previously, we were sold through in a lot of seasons last year, and that's not optimal for us. We don't want to look at empty shelves at the end of a seasonal set. And so with our anticipation for growth in the remainder of this year, we'll be buying appropriately to that. And hopefully, that means we've got fuller shelves at the end of a season. And with that, we'll come some clearance markdowns, there will be a little bit of a drag on markdown rates on a year-over-year basis, if I had to guess, but I would welcome a little bit of that rate drag because it means that we're full and in stock for the guests throughout the season."

And so as Brian said, engagement is very high. Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store's at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right? We get team members that know their jobs. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they're in there weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them. And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019.

We didn't see pressure on the supply chain and digital line this quarter. That's due in part to the just incredible strength in our store business, with stores up 18% on a year-over-year basis. I get excited by the efficiency improvements I see us continue to make in our digital experience. John talked to some of those just a minute ago. But we can do a lot with the volumes that we've built over the last 2 years in some of those same-day services. And all of that volume translates to more efficiency opportunity as we can continue to squeeze down the per unit cost to fulfill. 
But I don't shy away from growth -- or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omnichannel guests, more guests using Drive-Up, more guests using same day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new Drive-Up or ship guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth, and that's how we continue to think about it."

I'd say we're still firmly in crawl here in Minneapolis. And so we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. But the play here is a couple of things. And first of all, it's about capacity in the stores. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space. And that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store. And that's an important thing for us. Then as we move downstream, the more granular sort is where we start to see potentially cost reductions as we can sort to provide to our carrier partners further downstream in their operations. And like wed announced about a month ago, using the Deliv technology, creating local routes for local packages, we can get very efficient on delivery using ship and ship drivers. And so put all that together and our guest gets a great experience, we create more capacity. And we have the opportunity to continue to improve what we believe are already advantaged economics because of our stores' hub model. So more to come on all that.

The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growth and healing. From our unique mix of categories, to our unmatched set of fulfillment options, our business is delivering what consumers want and need each and every day. 
The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%. Maintaining that pace this quarter was especially notable, given that we were comping over double-digit growth a year ago. 
Over the last 2 years, comp sales have grown about 36%. And total sales expanded by $6.5 billion in the first quarter alone. This year's sales growth reflected more than $1 billion in market share gains, a clear signal of how relevant guests find our experience even though they have many more shopping options available compared with this time last year. 
In a quarter featuring many things to celebrate, I'm most proud of the performance of our stores. With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out, we've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping. Guests are happy to come back to our stores because they love the environment we've created and invested in over time. 
As a result, our store comp sales increased 18% in Q1, driven almost entirely by higher traffic and accounting for the vast majority of our growth. Contrast that to a year ago when the channel mix of our business was changing rapidly, with guests leaning heavily into our digital fulfillment options, essentially our same-day services in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. 
A year ago on this call, we were highlighting a digital comp of 141%, driven by growth in our same-day services of more than 275%. These 2 contrasting scenarios clearly demonstrate the flexibility of our operating model. But they also show how our stores and digital channels complement each other to drive guest engagement. 
Even though digital stole the headlines a year ago, our store comps actually increased about 1% in the first quarter last year. And this year, while store sales accounted for most of our growth, first quarter digital comp sales also grew 50%, on top of last year's enormous numbers. This is the power of 'and'. Guests turn to Target because of our stores and our digital options, not one versus the other. And for us, the distinction between a store sale and a digital sale is largely irrelevant. 
Because of our unique stores-as-hub model, more than 3/4 of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. That means, in total, more than 95% of Target's first quarter sales were driven by our store assets, store inventory and store teams. This store-driven growth is translating to outstanding bottom line performance. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.69 established a new all-time high for the company. Compared to 2020 when profitability took a temporary dip, this year's performance represents an astounding increase, more than sixfold. If we look back to first quarter, this year's adjusted EPS was more than 140% higher, demonstrating how far our business has advanced in a short time. 
I want to pause here and thank our team members across the world. They have consistently demonstrated incredible passion, commitment and focus to serve our guests and take care of each other. I am grateful and proud to serve with this outstanding team and to share the incredible business results they're delivering quarter after quarter. 
It's also important to highlight how the category mix plays a key role in the flexibility of our model. For instance, with guests venturing out, we've seen an incredible rebound in apparel sales, with Q1 comp growth of more than 60%. On the other hand, and as expected, we experienced lower growth in Food, Beverages and Essentials, as we annualized the peak stock-up period a year ago. Most notably, we saw continued strength in our Home and Hardlines categories, which delivered outsized growth on top of very strong numbers a year ago. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. 
A relentless focus on operational excellence is another key factor in our performance. This is best summarized by our guest satisfaction scores, which across all of our services, have remained stable or moved higher despite record growth that's now compounding on a 2-year basis. This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pickup, Drive-Up and ship have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth, and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter. 
Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than 1/3 of our digital sales. While all 3 same-day services continue to grow faster than overall digital, Drive-Up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago, and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year. 
Put another way, in the first quarter alone, Drive-Up sales have grown by well over $1 billion in the last 2 years. As John will outline in more detail, we continue to expand the assortment available for Drive-Up, and we've earmarked capital investments to make Drive-Up even more convenient for our guests and efficient for our team, given that we anticipate continued rapid growth of this service. 
While it's gratifying to see what our team has accomplished over the last several years, there is much more opportunity in front of us. We're planning significant investments in our store assets, as we remodel hundreds more locations, roll out new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, invest in the efficiency of our same-day services, and enter new neighborhood by opening new small- and medium-sized stores we're also investing in our brand portfolio, as we focus on presenting the best owned and national brands to our guests, which we highlight through the best in-store and digital shopping experience in the market. 
We're also making continued investments in safety and cleanliness, reinforcing the trust and confidence we've already established with our guests. And we continue to invest in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and advancement, to ensure that Target continues to be a destination for top talent. And as you've seen from many of our recent announcements, we're investing to leverage our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families. 
This summer, we'll share more information about our refreshed enterprise sustainability strategy that further draws on our company legacy of corporate responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. As part of our immediate efforts, we'll focus on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity in all communities, all in service to a safe and prosperous future for all. 
It was 4 years ago, at the beginning of 2017, that we first announced our plan to double down on investments and growth. The decisions we announced that day and the investments we made in the intervening years left us well prepared to handle all the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. 
In that first quarter of 2017, our business generated sales of just over $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.21; 4 years later, first quarter sales have grown nearly 50% and adjusted earnings per share have tripled. From today's vantage point, the opportunities ahead of us, both this year and over time, are just as bright as they were on that day 4 years ago. Despite what's already been accomplished, we've only scratched the surface of what this brand and this team can accomplish over time. I'm excited to stand with them as we write the next chapter in this great company's history. 
Now I'll turn it over to Christina, who will share more perspective on our first quarter results and for priorities going forward. Christina?"

As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes fo",1796,"Thanks, Brian. As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes for our sales, both by category and in total. And so far, with one quarter behind us, results have been extremely positive across every dimension. 
In the face of this strength, we've seen an incredible response from our teams across the board, from our stores, to our merchants, to the supply chain, who've all worked together in service of our guests. While there are many ways to measure the impact of those efforts, guest loyalty and market share are the 2 most important measures of success in this volatile time. 
Consequently, it's incredibly gratifying to see that across every one of our guest segments in the first quarter, we measured an increase in average trips per guest and a larger average basket. This led to more than $1 billion of additional market share in the quarter, on top of $1 billion gain a year ago. 
In terms of category performance, we saw the strongest growth in our Apparel business, which delivered comp growth in the low 60% range. As Brian mentioned, we saw a temporary dip in apparel sales last year, when first quarter comps were down around 20%. Following this year's strong increase, first quarter apparel sales have grown approximately 29% over the last 2 years. 
Home also delivered incredible growth with an increase in the mid-30% range, on top of a high single-digit increase a year ago. Within Home, growth was strong across the board, with the most robust performance in our decorative home and seasonal businesses. 
Hardlines also delivered huge volume, with comp growth above 30%, on top of a 20% increase a year ago. Results were led by sporting goods and toys, which both saw comps above 40%. 
Beauty comp in the high teens, on top of a high single-digit growth a year ago. Within Beauty, the skin care, sun care and bath categories delivered comp growth in the mid-30% range, with cosmetics growing in the low 20s. 
Finally, our Essentials and Food categories both delivered comps in the low to mid-single digits. To see healthy growth on top of last year is remarkable as you'll recall that a year ago, guests were aggressively stocking up their pantries, fridges and freezers, and we sold virtually every unit of paper goods that we owned. 
Beyond category strength, I want to pause and also highlight that sales on Target's own brands grew approximately 36% in the first quarter, the strongest increase we've ever recorded. Because of our unique capabilities in product design, development and sourcing, our own brand products offer an unbeatable combination of design, quality and value. These brands aren't something that our guests pick up while they're at Target, they're a big reason why they shop at Target, which is why we continue to invest in them. 
We frequently talk about performance by category and our brands because it's important that our entire portfolio is healthy and well positioned to meet our guest needs. But it's also important to realize that they create value for our guests beyond simply the sum of the parts. Rather, it's the combination of all our offerings, including categories, brands and services across our distinct multichannel experience, that allows Target to serve our guest needs today and over time. 
Last year, as guests focused more on enjoying time at home, that had implications not just for our Home category, but also for Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Essentials. And their focus on health and well-being affected trends in activewear, Beauty, health care, Food & Beverage and more. 
The same is true for our sales channels. As guests last year focused on social distancing, they leaned into digital, including our same-day services. And this year, as they're looking to get back out in public, they're flocking to our stores, based on the trust we established over time, which was further reinforced by last year's investments. 
So as we plan the remainder of the year, both in total and by category, we continue to listen closely to our guests to understand how they're thinking and feeling. And when we talk to our guests today, they tell us they want to maintain some of the new habits and routines they formed during the pandemic, including an enhanced focus on the joy of home and health and well-being of their family. 
At the same time, there's a rapidly emerging emphasis on style and mobility as guests feel increasingly safe in public spaces. That trend is playing out in an explosive demand for dresses and cosmetics as well as luggage and categories based on being active like sporting goods and Performance Activewear. This reinforces the concept of 'and'. Target can fulfill our guests' needs as they focus on home and health and when they look to venture out. We can welcome them back into our stores and continue to serve them with the same-day services they've recently tried and now love. 
So after a record-setting first quarter, we're keeping our foot on the gas, based on our guests' desire to bring rejuvenated life and energy to their homes, celebrate seasonal moments with loved ones and step out in public. I could not be more excited about the ways we're ready to inspire and energize our guests. 
Just last week, we launched our latest limited-time collection, Hilton Carter for Target. Off to a great start, this collection features live plants, foe greenery and unique plant accessories for experienced and novice gardeners alike. Not to be outdone by their parents, younger kids want to make their spaces their own. And our popular kids brand, Pillowfort, will continue to help them do just that. For its 5-year anniversary, Pillowfort is celebrating with hundreds of new items that can grow with them and be used in any area of the house. 
As our guests begin stepping out, they're focused on looking and feeling their best. With this rekindled passion for fashion, our guests will be overjoyed with the latest installment of our designer dress collection. Featuring designs by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo, this assortment offers more than 70 original and affordable dresses in bold, bright patterns and statement silhouettes. And of course, with our continual focus on inclusivity and celebrating everybody, this collection features affordable prices in a range of sizes from XXS to 4X.
We've long focused on making Target a destination for holidays and life events, and we just wrapped up a huge Mother's Day season. We had solutions for mom across the store, from apparel, gifting, beauty, flowers, candy and more. And now we're gearing up for Father's Day in June. We've got a great assortment of gifts for dad, from All in Motion attire for golfing, hitting the gym or just hanging out, to a line of shave, skin care and hair care products from Goodfellow.
Of course, June celebrations aren't exclusive to dad. With so many in-person celebrations canceled last year, we're ecstatic about our fabulous new assortment for Pride as we celebrate love with our LGBTQIA guests, team members and neighbors. 
Later in the summer, we know families are excited to celebrate the 4th of July with a long-awaited neighborhood cookout, a road trip out of town or an intimate backyard barbecue with a few fireworks. With great deals and the perfect owned and national brand assortments, it doesn't matter if the celebration is big or small, Target is everything you'll need to fill a cooler, pack a beach bag and fill up with friends, family and fun. 
And before we know it, it's time to head back to school, and we're planning for one of our biggest back-to-school and college seasons ever. Of course, we'll have great deals on all the traditional school supplies, but we'll also have the new normals on the school supply list, like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. 
With local school lists on target.com and our industry-leading fulfillment options, back-to-school shopping has never been safer or easier. And with the great new apparel offerings from Cat & Jack, Art Class, More than Magic, Wild Fable, Original Use and All in Motion, all found only at Target, we'll have our school-bound guests looking and feeling fresh for that first day of school. 
Before I close, I want to pause and highlight some of the work I'm most passionate about, and that's our work on Target's REACH Committee, which we formed last year to achieve lasting systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities. This work aligns with our vision for sustainability at Target, and it's a strong example of how we're becoming an equitable company, creating change that strengthens our business. 
Hopefully, you've seen our recent announcement that Target is committed to spending more than $2 billion with black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. In addition, we've announced a new scholarship program to support students and more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities. And this summer, both in-store and online, we are adding more items to our Black Beyond Measure assortment. I'm so proud of these efforts and everything we do to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. 
I also want to give a quick shout out to our store teams. I recently had a chance to visit stores in the New York City market. And after more than a year in which most of my meetings have been virtual, it was an incredibly energizing experience. I visited new small-format locations across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn. Every location was a unique reflection of the local neighborhood, from design, to assortment and the team members serving their neighbors. Based on the energy and passion I could feel from these teams, it's clear why we're seeing such strong sales in our stores across the country. 
As the first Chief Growth Officer at Target, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunities still ahead of us. As you saw throughout 2020 and now in 2021, we have a long runway to continue investing in and growing our core business. At the same time, we'll continue to develop innovation pipelines and explore new initiatives, maintaining a balance between fundamentals and execution and the exploration of new opportunities. As we plan for future growth, we'll continue to listen to our guests and apply those insights to prioritize their work. With this guest-first approach, we're confident we can continue to build relevance and market share, both today and over time. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
174438,706476635,2292411,"Target Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5",1199,"Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5 billion of sales in the first quarter. Given this continued rapid growth and the opportunities still ahead of us, the operations team is focused on building capacity and enhancing processes to create and enable Target's continued growth. 
That work starts in our supply chain, where we've outlined our plans to add 4 new regional distribution centers by the end of 2022, with the first 2 buildings slated to open later this year. These new buildings located in Chicago and New Jersey are set to go live in the next several months, creating additional capacity for the network in total, while enhancing service levels in high-volume markets that continue to grow. More specifically, once these buildings are operating at scale, they'll meaningfully shorten lead times to nearby stores, improving in-stock levels, while reducing the need for safety stock in those locations. 
Beyond the capacity we're adding with these new buildings, we're also investing in updated fixtures to create additional capacity across our current network. These changes are highly capital efficient, involving a small amount of capital to open up a substantial amount of incremental capacity within the network, equivalent to the addition of about 1.5 new distribution centers. 
And as we told you at our meeting in March, we're pleased with the initial results from our new sortation center in Minneapolis. As a result, we have plans to build up to 5 more of these facilities in 2021, with additional openings planned for 2022 and beyond. We're opening these centers, which are smaller than an average store in markets with a high concentration of local package delivery. They're designed to receive and sort packages from a large group of surrounding stores multiple times a day, which allows for more optimized granular sortation. This precision reduces costs for our delivery partners, meaningfully reducing what we pay for delivery. In addition, these facilities eliminate the need for sortation with the stores they serve, while freeing up packing capacity at those same locations. 
Sort centers have long been on our fulfillment road map, which we've built through internal development along with small acquisitions. In these facilities, we optimize the selection of delivery partners by applying technology from Grand Junction, which we acquired in 2017. And we optimize sortation to minimize costs to increase speed by applying technology we acquired from Deliv in 2020. 
In addition, beginning in the first quarter, our Minneapolis sort center began testing package delivery using Shipt, another 2017 acquisition, to add capacity, reduce costs and enable more, flexibility, which will benefit our rapidly growing ship-from-store capability over time. 
Within our store network, we've begun ramping up our remodel program, following the pause we implemented last year. We have just over 34 remodels slated for completion in the second quarter and more than 100 planned for the back half of the year. Based on past experience, we expect these remodeled stores will generate an incremental 2% to 4% sales growth in the year following completion, with another 2% incremental growth in the second year. 
Beyond the direct impact on sales, these transformations create an ideal platform for all of the merchandise innovations and service enhancements that we'll launch over time. In addition to full store remodels, we're planning other store investments this year, including more than 100 Ulta shop-in-shops slated to launch in the back half of the year, as well as our enhanced Apple layout in Electronics in select stores across the country. 
Among our store services, we've long known that our same-day fulfillment options would be popular with our guests. But their growth over the last few years has been far above our expectations. This is most evident in our Drive-Up service where first quarter sales volume was nearly 21x higher than it was 2 years ago, amounting to nearly $1.3 billion of incremental sales volume over that period. 
In the face of this incredible growth, there are emerging opportunities in high-volume locations to invest in capacity and efficiency in support of our same-day services. Specifically, in more than 100 locations this year, we're investing in small projects to optimize the front ends of these buildings, freeing up additional capacity for continued same-day growth, while making the layout more efficient and safer for the team. 
We also continue to enhance the assortments available for all 3 same-day services, adding more perishable food to our pickup and Drive-Up services and more general merchandise like apparel to the assortment available through Shipt. And we just announced that in the second quarter, we'll have adult beverages available through pickup and/or Drive-Up in more than 1,200 stores and available for same-day delivery in more than 600 stores across the country. 
Beyond activity in existing stores, we're expanding our new store opening plans to more than 30 additional locations across the country this year, as we continue to find compelling opportunities in urban and dense suburban markets and on our near-college campuses. In recent years, these custom formats have typically been less than 50,000 square feet. However, given local real estate conditions in dense suburban markets, we're also finding compelling opportunities to open somewhat bigger stores, between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, which weren't available in the past. As a group, these new stores are generating higher-than-average sales productivity, above average gross margin rates and strong financial returns, and we see a very long runway to open more of them over time. 
And finally, after store comp growth of 18% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by traffic, we're confident that we're already benefiting from a differentiated service model in our stores. But that's a lead we can't take for granted. So we're continually looking for ways to get even better. So this year, our store teams are rolling out an enhanced service model, focused on consistency of every interaction to ensure that our guests will always feel welcomed and appreciated. And if they need help, there will be team members who can find solutions to enhance their experience. 
This new engagement model is strongly connected to our company purpose, culture and values. And we're supporting it with enhanced training and tools across the chain. It's designed not to be a one-and-done effort, but a sustainable model that's integrated with our operational goals, not something separate that's added on to everyday tasks. 
So as I turn it over to Michael, I want to once again thank the entire team for the incredible things you've already done and your passion to continually raise the bar. This year, I'm celebrating my 25th year at Target, so you might be tempted to think I've seen it all. But when I step back and realize what this team has accomplished in the last year under the most challenging of circumstances, it's clear that there is no limit to this team's potential, and there's no doubt that we have the best team in retail. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."
174438,706476635,2292411,"Target Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more",1721,"Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. 
On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more than offset all of the unique headwinds we faced over this challenging period, resulting in really strong performance. Target's total sales grew 23.3% in the first quarter, reflecting comp growth of 22.9%. Given last year's double-digit growth, first quarter sales have expanded more than 37% over the last 2 years, driven almost entirely by higher comps. Unlike last year, when consumers were consolidating trips and shopping less often, this year's comp growth was driven primarily by a traffic increase of more than 17% combined with a 5% increase in average ticket. 
As Brian mentioned, store comps were the growth engine this year, while digital was the primary driver in Q1 2020. As such, over the last 2 years, both our stores and digital channels have expanded their first quarter sales by more than $3 billion. This balance highlights the relevance and complementary nature of both channels in serving our guest needs. 
Our first quarter gross margin rate of 30% was 490 basis points ahead of last year when we faced a number of temporary headwinds, including markdowns and other costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. Compared with 2019, this year's first quarter gross margin rate was about 40 basis points higher, which is notable given that digital sales penetration more than doubled in that time, from 7.1% in 2019 to more than 18% this year. 
In terms of the year-over-year gross margin drivers, mix had a positive impact of about 150 basis points, reflecting the dramatic increase in apparel sales and continued strength in our home category. The remaining favorability was driven by core merchandising, as we continued to benefit from low promotional and clearance markdown rates, and we annualized last year's costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. The rate impact of supply chain and digital fulfillment costs was approximately neutral compared to last year, as the costs of outsized digital growth were offset by the benefit of a stronger mix of same-day fulfillment and our ongoing work to control unit costs across our entire suite of digital fulfillment options. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 18.6% this year, down more than 2 percentage points from 20.7% a year ago and 20.8% in 2019. In terms of drivers, leverage benefits have more than offset all of the extra costs we've absorbed over the last 2 years, including meaningfully higher pay and benefits for our team and other investments to protect the health and safety of our team and guests. 
While D&A expenses have grown in each of the last 2 years, this year's first quarter D&A expense rate was about 40 basis points lower than a year ago and about 80 basis points lower than 2019. 
Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate increased an astounding 7.4 percentage points compared with a year ago to an unprecedented 9.8% this year, from a temporary low of 2.4% rate a year ago. However, even compared to a very healthy 6.4% operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2019, this year's rate was more than 3 percentage points higher. In terms of dollars, first quarter operating income has more than doubled over the last 2 years. 
On the bottom line, our business delivered first quarter GAAP EPS of $4.17, up more than 600% from a year ago and well over double our 2019 GAAP EPS. On the adjusted EPS line, which excluded the gain from the sale of our DermStore business, we earned $3.69 this year, more than 500% higher than a year ago and well over double our 2019 adjusted EPS. 
As you know, our capital deployment priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we returned cash through our quarterly dividend, which we've maintained every quarter as a public company and grown every year since 1971. And finally, we returned excess cash over time through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A debt ratings. 
In the first quarter, we invested just over $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business. We continue to expect our full year CapEx will be approximately $4 billion, but the bulk of those expenditures will be more backloaded in the year, given the timing of this year's projects. 
We paid dividends of $340 million in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago, as growth in the per share dividend was partially offset by a decline in share count. And finally, we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, following a temporary pause in 2020, and deployed about $1.2 billion to retire 6.1 million shares at an average share price of just under $191. And in February, we completed the sale of our DermStore business, which contributed just over $350 million to our first quarter cash flow. 
Altogether, we ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. This was down about $700 million from the beginning of the quarter, but still well above where we expect to operate over time. With this cash, we'll be funding approximately $3.5 billion of additional CapEx in 2021 and we'll be recommending a robust increase in our quarterly dividends to the Board later this year. Beyond these uses, we should have ample capacity for continued share repurchases, and we'll continue to govern the magnitude and pace of repurchases in support of our goal to maintain our Middle A credit ratings. And given where we are today, it will likely be a multiyear journey before our debt metrics move fully back to where they've been over time. 
Now I'd like to turn briefly to our return on invested capital, which reflects both our operating results and the investments we've made to generate them. In the first quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC moved up to 30.7%, which is well over double the 13.4% we reported a year ago. While we've indicated that this measure will likely be volatile in the near term and could revert to a very healthy number, near 20% over time, the fact that our business has generated such a high after-tax return over the last 12 months is a testament both to the strength of our model and outstanding execution by our team. 
Now let me turn to our sales outlook. We learned a lot in the first quarter, and notably, got our first look at how our business is successfully comping the comp, with impressive growth on top of last year's strong surge in sales. Also, and importantly, we've continued to gain market share on top of last year's dramatic share gains. Based on these results, we're now planning for our business to deliver a mid- to high single-digit comp increase in the second quarter. This expectation is in line with the 2-year growth rates we saw in the first quarter. 
And while we only have a couple of weeks in the quarter behind us, the results we've seen so far this month are consistent with this outlook. The range for second quarter operating income remains wide, but should remain strong, far ahead of our 2019 rate of 7.2%, but perhaps not fully as high as last year's unprecedented rate of 10%. 
In terms of the specific puts and takes in the quarter, we'll be comping over last year's reversal of the return reserve estimate, which added about $110 million to last year's operating income. In addition, this year, we're making purposeful investments in store labor hours to ensure we deliver outstanding service and stronger in-stocks than a year ago, when sales grew far beyond our expectations. Of course, we'll continue to benefit from meaningful sales leverage, given that we're planning for healthy growth on top of last year's record-setting increase. Putting that all together, we expect to see continued strong performance on this line. 
In the back half of the year, the range of possibilities for comp growth is also quite wide, and we'll gain more insights as the year progresses. As of today, based on our recent results and confidence going forward, we expect to see positive single-digit comps in the back half of the year, on top of last year's unprecedented performance. 
Regarding our full year operating margin rate, following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we have increasing confidence in the consumer and industry backdrop in the back half of the year. As such, the range of outcomes for our 2021 operating margin rate has moved significantly higher. So despite the anticipated headwind from higher markdown rates following last year's historically low rates, we believe that our business is positioned to deliver a full year operating margin rate that's well over last year's rate of 7%. More specifically, we believe this year's operating margin rate could reach 8% or perhaps a little higher. We'll continue to refine our view throughout the year. 
As the team looks ahead to the rest of the year, they're focused on staying agile in what continues to be a volatile environment. Rather than placing all of their bets on a single forecast number, they're focused on contingency planning, creating flexibility that will allow us to react to unexpected changes, and importantly, take advantage of opportunity when we see it. 
We're also excited about the investments still ahead of us and the growth they'll create: hundreds more remodels; dozens of new stores; new Ulta and Apple shopping environments; and supply chain investments to support both replenishment and fulfillment. Given the performance we're seeing today, which is the product of the investments we've made over the last few years, we're eagerly leading into future opportunities to enable more profitable, high-return growth over time. 
Before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to add my voice and thanks to the team. The value our team members are creating for our business, communities, shareholders and each other goes far beyond what we can measure in a P&L. Thanks for making Target an even stronger company on behalf of all of our stakeholders.

I'm thankful for their continued focus on our guests, focus on operational excellence and passion for our brand. 
I also want to acknowledge the challenges facing our India headquarter team, along with our team members who have family there, given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We have been carefully monitoring conditions on the ground and providing extra support to our team during this difficult time to ensure they can take care of themselves and their families. We've also funded $500,000 donation to UNICEF set to increase access to option treatment in hospitals across the country and bring testing resources to the hardest hit communities. We're hopeful that conditions there will continue to improve. 
So now as we get ready to move to your questions, I want to underscore the confidence you've heard throughout our remarks today. Coming off an unbelievable year in 2020, we had a lot of confidence as we entered 2021, but our first quarter results came in far ahead of our baseline expectations. 
With the macro and consumer backdrop that's been surprisingly positive, we've seen remarkable momentum in our performance, even as we started to comp over the period of peak increases a year ago. The flexibility of our category mix and fulfillment options, combined with an agile, energetic and engaged team, continue to resonate with our guests, driving double-digit traffic growth and an increase in average tickets in the first quarter. 
But as you've often heard me say, we shouldn't confuse performance with potential. So even after more than a year of unprecedented growth, we're seeing focus and leaning into the opportunities ahead of us, making investments to build on an already strong foundation. With these investments, I'm confident that our business model and outstanding team will continue to raise the bar on an already best-in-class retail experience, resulting in even stronger loyalty and guest engagement over time. 
With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions."

As Brian was just sharing, we really are excited about the strength across the board.

But the reality is the 3 trends that I talked about in my prepared remarks are benefiting our multi-category approach across the board: joy at Home and the opportunity to celebrate everything that brings the guests to their home, eating, being with their families, and the investments that they've made over time in their home; health and well-being, the opportunities that our guests are taking to invest in proactive health care and fitness at home and activewear. 
And then the newer and more emerging trend is really style and mobility. As guests are going out, they are looking for a fresh look. So our newest collections of dresses by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo couldn't have been more perfectly timed to really help guests look their best in what they're wearing and certainly also across their beauty trends."

And we have always said, we like it for a couple of reasons: One, great guest service; and two, better economics. Same-day services are that on steroids. They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home because, as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home. So if we take that out of the equation, then we end up with economics that are much closer to the store transaction. 
The thing we love about all of the same-day services, pick up, Drive-Up and ship, all of them continue to grow faster than our overall digital growth, and we continue to find ways to improve them, as you said. Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart, to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store so that we don't end up with what we call, INFs, or items not found. 
And then we continue to invest in helping them physically. And that's a big focus for us this year and will be over the next couple of years. In the case of Drive-Up, which as we've talked about a couple of times, Brian talked about and I talked about, has been our fastest-growing same-day service since -- basically since we started it. It also has our highest NPS score, so guests love it. We let you decide when you want to come. We don't force you into a time slot. And then our team brings it out to you in 2 minutes or less. So our guests absolutely love that. And you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. 
Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature control products to Drive-Up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well. 
So every year, our team comes up with multiple ways to continue to improve the service, first and foremost, for the guest, and then on the back end, improve things for our team so they can execute it easier as we continue to grow. So we see a lot more opportunity for us. And as I said, that will be a big part of our capital investment over the next several years."

When it comes to markdowns through the balance of the year, we've talked about this a little bit previously, we were sold through in a lot of seasons last year, and that's not optimal for us. We don't want to look at empty shelves at the end of a seasonal set. And so with our anticipation for growth in the remainder of this year, we'll be buying appropriately to that. And hopefully, that means we've got fuller shelves at the end of a season.

Just as importantly, we've invested in training to help upskill them. And then over the course of the past 1.5 years or so, we've invested in safety very overtly. 
And so as Brian said, engagement is very high. Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store's at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right? We get team members that know their jobs. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they're in there weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them. 
And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019.

We didn't see pressure on the supply chain and digital line this quarter. That's due in part to the just incredible strength in our store business, with stores up 18% on a year-over-year basis. 
I get excited by the efficiency improvements I see us continue to make in our digital experience. John talked to some of those just a minute ago. But we can do a lot with the volumes that we've built over the last 2 years in some of those same-day services. And all of that volume translates to more efficiency opportunity as we can continue to squeeze down the per unit cost to fulfill. 
But I don't shy away from growth -- or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omnichannel guests, more guests using Drive-Up, more guests using same-day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new Drive-Up or Shipt guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth, and that's how we continue to think about it."

I'd say we're still firmly in crawl here in Minneapolis. And so we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. But the play here is a couple of things. 
And first of all, it's about capacity in the stores. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space, and that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store. And that's an important thing for us. Then as we move downstream, the more granular sort is where we start to see potentially cost reductions as we can sort to provide to our carrier partners further downstream in their operations. And like we'd announced about a month ago, using the Deliv technology, creating local routes for local packages, we can get very efficient on delivery using Shipt and Shipt drivers. And so put all that together and our guest gets a great experience, we create more capacity. And we have the opportunity to continue to improve what we believe are already advantaged economics because of our stores-as-hub model. So more to come on all that. It's early days, but we remain pretty optimistic on all 3 of those fronts."

The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growt",1380,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 
The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growth and healing. From our unique mix of categories, to our unmatched set of fulfillment options, our business is delivering what consumers want and need each and every day. 
The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%. Maintaining that pace this quarter was especially notable, given that we were comping over double-digit growth a year ago. 
Over the last 2 years, comp sales have grown about 36%. And total sales expanded by $6.5 billion in the first quarter alone. This year's sales growth reflected more than $1 billion in market share gains, a clear signal of how relevant guests find our experience even though they have many more shopping options available compared with this time last year. 
In a quarter featuring many things to celebrate, I'm most proud of the performance of our stores. With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out, we've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping. Guests are happy to come back to our stores because they love the environment we've created and invested in over time. 
As a result, our store comp sales increased 18% in Q1, driven almost entirely by higher traffic and accounting for the vast majority of our growth. Contrast that to a year ago when the channel mix of our business was changing rapidly, with guests leaning heavily into our digital fulfillment options, essentially our same-day services in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. 
A year ago on this call, we were highlighting a digital comp of 141%, driven by growth in our same-day services of more than 275%. These 2 contrasting scenarios clearly demonstrate the flexibility of our operating model. But they also show how our stores and digital channels complement each other to drive guest engagement. 
Even though digital stole the headlines a year ago, our store comps actually increased about 1% in the first quarter last year. And this year, while store sales accounted for most of our growth, first quarter digital comp sales also grew 50%, on top of last year's enormous numbers. This is the power of 'and'. Guests turn to Target because of our stores and our digital options, not one versus the other. And for us, the distinction between a store sale and a digital sale is largely irrelevant. 
Because of our unique stores-as-hub model, more than 3/4 of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. That means, in total, more than 95% of Target's first quarter sales were driven by our store assets, store inventory and store teams. This store-driven growth is translating to outstanding bottom line performance. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.69 established a new all-time high for the company. Compared to 2020 when profitability took a temporary dip, this year's performance represents an astounding increase, more than sixfold. If we look back to first quarter, this year's adjusted EPS was more than 140% higher, demonstrating how far our business has advanced in a short time. 
I want to pause here and thank our team members across the world. They have consistently demonstrated incredible passion, commitment and focus to serve our guests and take care of each other. I am grateful and proud to serve with this outstanding team and to share the incredible business results they're delivering quarter after quarter. 
It's also important to highlight how the category mix plays a key role in the flexibility of our model. For instance, with guests venturing out, we've seen an incredible rebound in apparel sales, with Q1 comp growth of more than 60%. On the other hand, and as expected, we experienced lower growth in Food, Beverages and Essentials, as we annualized the peak stock-up period a year ago. Most notably, we saw continued strength in our Home and Hardlines categories, which delivered outsized growth on top of very strong numbers a year ago. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. 
A relentless focus on operational excellence is another key factor in our performance. This is best summarized by our guest satisfaction scores, which across all of our services, have remained stable or moved higher despite record growth that's now compounding on a 2-year basis. This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pickup, Drive-Up and ship have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth, and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter. 
Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than 1/3 of our digital sales. While all 3 same-day services continue to grow faster than overall digital, Drive-Up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago, and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year. 
Put another way, in the first quarter alone, Drive-Up sales have grown by well over $1 billion in the last 2 years. As John will outline in more detail, we continue to expand the assortment available for Drive-Up, and we've earmarked capital investments to make Drive-Up even more convenient for our guests and efficient for our team, given that we anticipate continued rapid growth of this service. 
While it's gratifying to see what our team has accomplished over the last several years, there is much more opportunity in front of us. We're planning significant investments in our store assets, as we remodel hundreds more locations, roll out new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, invest in the efficiency of our same-day services, and enter new neighborhood by opening new small- and medium-sized stores we're also investing in our brand portfolio, as we focus on presenting the best owned and national brands to our guests, which we highlight through the best in-store and digital shopping experience in the market. 
We're also making continued investments in safety and cleanliness, reinforcing the trust and confidence we've already established with our guests. And we continue to invest in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and advancement, to ensure that Target continues to be a destination for top talent. And as you've seen from many of our recent announcements, we're investing to leverage our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families. 
This summer, we'll share more information about our refreshed enterprise sustainability strategy that further draws on our company legacy of corporate responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. As part of our immediate efforts, we'll focus on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity in all communities, all in service to a safe and prosperous future for all. 
It was 4 years ago, at the beginning of 2017, that we first announced our plan to double down on investments and growth. The decisions we announced that day and the investments we made in the intervening years left us well prepared to handle all the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. 
In that first quarter of 2017, our business generated sales of just over $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.21; 4 years later, first quarter sales have grown nearly 50% and adjusted earnings per share have tripled. From today's vantage point, the opportunities ahead of us, both this year and over time, are just as bright as they were on that day 4 years ago. Despite what's already been accomplished, we've only scratched the surface of what this brand and this team can accomplish over time. I'm excited to stand with them as we write the next chapter in this great company's history. 
Now I'll turn it over to Christina, who will share more perspective on our first quarter results and for priorities going forward. Christina?"

That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes for our sales, both by category and in total. And so far, with one quarter behind us, results have been extremely positive across every dimension. 
In the face of this strength, we've seen an incredible response from our teams across the board, from our stores, to our merchants, to the supply chain, who've all worked together in service of our guests. While there are many ways to measure the impact of those efforts, guest loyalty and market share are the 2 most important measures of success in this volatile time. 
Consequently, it's incredibly gratifying to see that across every one of our guest segments in the first quarter, we measured an increase in average trips per guest and a larger average basket. This led to more than $1 billion of additional market share in the quarter, on top of $1 billion gain a year ago. 
In terms of category performance, we saw the strongest growth in our Apparel business, which delivered comp growth in the low 60% range. As Brian mentioned, we saw a temporary dip in apparel sales last year, when first quarter comps were down around 20%. Following this year's strong increase, first quarter apparel sales have grown approximately 29% over the last 2 years. 
Home also delivered incredible growth with an increase in the mid-30% range, on top of a high single-digit increase a year ago. Within Home, growth was strong across the board, with the most robust performance in our decorative home and seasonal businesses. 
Hardlines also delivered huge volume, with comp growth above 30%, on top of a 20% increase a year ago. Results were led by sporting goods and toys, which both saw comps above 40%. 
Beauty comp in the high teens, on top of a high single-digit growth a year ago. Within Beauty, the skin care, sun care and bath categories delivered comp growth in the mid-30% range, with cosmetics growing in the low 20s. 
Finally, our Essentials and Food categories both delivered comps in the low to mid-single digits. To see healthy growth on top of last year is remarkable as you'll recall that a year ago, guests were aggressively stocking up their pantries, fridges and freezers, and we sold virtually every unit of paper goods that we owned. 
Beyond category strength, I want to pause and also highlight that sales on Target's own brands grew approximately 36% in the first quarter, the strongest increase we've ever recorded. Because of our unique capabilities in product design, development and sourcing, our own brand products offer an unbeatable combination of design, quality and value. These brands aren't something that our guests pick up while they're at Target, they're a big reason why they shop at Target, which is why we continue to invest in them. 
We frequently talk about performance by category and our brands because it's important that our entire portfolio is healthy and well positioned to meet our guest needs. But it's also important to realize that they create value for our guests beyond simply the sum of the parts. Rather, it's the combination of all our offerings, including categories, brands and services across our distinct multichannel experience, that allows Target to serve our guest needs today and over time. 
Last year, as guests focused more on enjoying time at home, that had implications not just for our Home category, but also for Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Essentials. And their focus on health and well-being affected trends in activewear, Beauty, health care, Food & Beverage and more. 
The same is true for our sales channels. As guests last year focused on social distancing, they leaned into digital, including our same-day services. And this year, as they're looking to get back out in public, they're flocking to our stores, based on the trust we established over time, which was further reinforced by last year's investments. 
So as we plan the remainder of the year, both in total and by category, we continue to listen closely to our guests to understand how they're thinking and feeling. And when we talk to our guests today, they tell us they want to maintain some of the new habits and routines they formed during the pandemic, including an enhanced focus on the joy of home and health and well-being of their family. 
At the same time, there's a rapidly emerging emphasis on style and mobility as guests feel increasingly safe in public spaces. That trend is playing out in an explosive demand for dresses and cosmetics as well as luggage and categories based on being active like sporting goods and Performance Activewear. This reinforces the concept of 'and'. Target can fulfill our guests' needs as they focus on home and health and when they look to venture out. We can welcome them back into our stores and continue to serve them with the same-day services they've recently tried and now love. 
So after a record-setting first quarter, we're keeping our foot on the gas, based on our guests' desire to bring rejuvenated life and energy to their homes, celebrate seasonal moments with loved ones and step out in public. I could not be more excited about the ways we're ready to inspire and energize our guests. 
Just last week, we launched our latest limited-time collection, Hilton Carter for Target. Off to a great start, this collection features live plants, foe greenery and unique plant accessories for experienced and novice gardeners alike. Not to be outdone by their parents, younger kids want to make their spaces their own. And our popular kids brand, Pillowfort, will continue to help them do just that. For its 5-year anniversary, Pillowfort is celebrating with hundreds of new items that can grow with them and be used in any area of the house. 
As our guests begin stepping out, they're focused on looking and feeling their best. With this rekindled passion for fashion, our guests will be overjoyed with the latest installment of our designer dress collection. Featuring designs by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo, this assortment offers more than 70 original and affordable dresses in bold, bright patterns and statement silhouettes. And of course, with our continual focus on inclusivity and celebrating everybody, this collection features affordable prices in a range of sizes from XXS to 4X.
We've long focused on making Target a destination for holidays and life events, and we just wrapped up a huge Mother's Day season. We had solutions for mom across the store, from apparel, gifting, beauty, flowers, candy and more. And now we're gearing up for Father's Day in June. We've got a great assortment of gifts for dad, from All in Motion attire for golfing, hitting the gym or just hanging out, to a line of shave, skin care and hair care products from Goodfellow.
Of course, June celebrations aren't exclusive to dad. With so many in-person celebrations canceled last year, we're ecstatic about our fabulous new assortment for Pride as we celebrate love with our LGBTQIA guests, team members and neighbors. 
Later in the summer, we know families are excited to celebrate the 4th of July with a long-awaited neighborhood cookout, a road trip out of town or an intimate backyard barbecue with a few fireworks. With great deals and the perfect owned and national brand assortments, it doesn't matter if the celebration is big or small, Target is everything you'll need to fill a cooler, pack a beach bag and fill up with friends, family and fun. 
And before we know it, it's time to head back to school, and we're planning for one of our biggest back-to-school and college seasons ever. Of course, we'll have great deals on all the traditional school supplies, but we'll also have the new normals on the school supply list, like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. 
With local school lists on target.com and our industry-leading fulfillment options, back-to-school shopping has never been safer or easier. And with the great new apparel offerings from Cat & Jack, Art Class, More than Magic, Wild Fable, Original Use and All in Motion, all found only at Target, we'll have our school-bound guests looking and feeling fresh for that first day of school. 
Before I close, I want to pause and highlight some of the work I'm most passionate about, and that's our work on Target's REACH Committee, which we formed last year to achieve lasting systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities. This work aligns with our vision for sustainability at Target, and it's a strong example of how we're becoming an equitable company, creating change that strengthens our business. 
Hopefully, you've seen our recent announcement that Target is committed to spending more than $2 billion with black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. In addition, we've announced a new scholarship program to support students and more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities. And this summer, both in-store and online, we are adding more items to our Black Beyond Measure assortment. I'm so proud of these efforts and everything we do to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. 
I also want to give a quick shout out to our store teams. I recently had a chance to visit stores in the New York City market. And after more than a year in which most of my meetings have been virtual, it was an incredibly energizing experience. I visited new small-format locations across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn. Every location was a unique reflection of the local neighborhood, from design, to assortment and the team members serving their neighbors. Based on the energy and passion I could feel from these teams, it's clear why we're seeing such strong sales in our stores across the country. 
As the first Chief Growth Officer at Target, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunities still ahead of us. As you saw throughout 2020 and now in 2021, we have a long runway to continue investing in and growing our core business. At the same time, we'll continue to develop innovation pipelines and explore new initiatives, maintaining a balance between fundamentals and execution and the exploration of new opportunities. As we plan for future growth, we'll continue to listen to our guests and apply those insights to prioritize their work. With this guest-first approach, we're confident we can continue to build relevance and market share, both today and over time. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."
174438,706476635,2292413,"Target Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5",1199,"Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5 billion of sales in the first quarter. Given this continued rapid growth and the opportunities still ahead of us, the operations team is focused on building capacity and enhancing processes to create and enable Target's continued growth. 
That work starts in our supply chain, where we've outlined our plans to add 4 new regional distribution centers by the end of 2022, with the first 2 buildings slated to open later this year. These new buildings located in Chicago and New Jersey are set to go live in the next several months, creating additional capacity for the network in total, while enhancing service levels in high-volume markets that continue to grow. More specifically, once these buildings are operating at scale, they'll meaningfully shorten lead times to nearby stores, improving in-stock levels, while reducing the need for safety stock in those locations. 
Beyond the capacity we're adding with these new buildings, we're also investing in updated fixtures to create additional capacity across our current network. These changes are highly capital efficient, involving a small amount of capital to open up a substantial amount of incremental capacity within the network, equivalent to the addition of about 1.5 new distribution centers. 
And as we told you at our meeting in March, we're pleased with the initial results from our new sortation center in Minneapolis. As a result, we have plans to build up to 5 more of these facilities in 2021, with additional openings planned for 2022 and beyond. We're opening these centers, which are smaller than an average store in markets with a high concentration of local package delivery. They're designed to receive and sort packages from a large group of surrounding stores multiple times a day, which allows for more optimized granular sortation. This precision reduces costs for our delivery partners, meaningfully reducing what we pay for delivery. In addition, these facilities eliminate the need for sortation with the stores they serve, while freeing up packing capacity at those same locations. 
Sort centers have long been on our fulfillment road map, which we've built through internal development along with small acquisitions. In these facilities, we optimize the selection of delivery partners by applying technology from Grand Junction, which we acquired in 2017. And we optimize sortation to minimize costs to increase speed by applying technology we acquired from Deliv in 2020. 
In addition, beginning in the first quarter, our Minneapolis sort center began testing package delivery using Shipt, another 2017 acquisition, to add capacity, reduce costs and enable more, flexibility, which will benefit our rapidly growing ship-from-store capability over time. 
Within our store network, we've begun ramping up our remodel program, following the pause we implemented last year. We have just over 34 remodels slated for completion in the second quarter and more than 100 planned for the back half of the year. Based on past experience, we expect these remodeled stores will generate an incremental 2% to 4% sales growth in the year following completion, with another 2% incremental growth in the second year. 
Beyond the direct impact on sales, these transformations create an ideal platform for all of the merchandise innovations and service enhancements that we'll launch over time. In addition to full store remodels, we're planning other store investments this year, including more than 100 Ulta shop-in-shops slated to launch in the back half of the year, as well as our enhanced Apple layout in Electronics in select stores across the country. 
Among our store services, we've long known that our same-day fulfillment options would be popular with our guests. But their growth over the last few years has been far above our expectations. This is most evident in our Drive-Up service where first quarter sales volume was nearly 21x higher than it was 2 years ago, amounting to nearly $1.3 billion of incremental sales volume over that period. 
In the face of this incredible growth, there are emerging opportunities in high-volume locations to invest in capacity and efficiency in support of our same-day services. Specifically, in more than 100 locations this year, we're investing in small projects to optimize the front ends of these buildings, freeing up additional capacity for continued same-day growth, while making the layout more efficient and safer for the team. 
We also continue to enhance the assortments available for all 3 same-day services, adding more perishable food to our pickup and Drive-Up services and more general merchandise like apparel to the assortment available through Shipt. And we just announced that in the second quarter, we'll have adult beverages available through pickup and/or Drive-Up in more than 1,200 stores and available for same-day delivery in more than 600 stores across the country. 
Beyond activity in existing stores, we're expanding our new store opening plans to more than 30 additional locations across the country this year, as we continue to find compelling opportunities in urban and dense suburban markets and on our near-college campuses. In recent years, these custom formats have typically been less than 50,000 square feet. However, given local real estate conditions in dense suburban markets, we're also finding compelling opportunities to open somewhat bigger stores, between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, which weren't available in the past. As a group, these new stores are generating higher-than-average sales productivity, above average gross margin rates and strong financial returns, and we see a very long runway to open more of them over time. 
And finally, after store comp growth of 18% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by traffic, we're confident that we're already benefiting from a differentiated service model in our stores. But that's a lead we can't take for granted. So we're continually looking for ways to get even better. So this year, our store teams are rolling out an enhanced service model, focused on consistency of every interaction to ensure that our guests will always feel welcomed and appreciated. And if they need help, there will be team members who can find solutions to enhance their experience. 
This new engagement model is strongly connected to our company purpose, culture and values. And we're supporting it with enhanced training and tools across the chain. It's designed not to be a one-and-done effort, but a sustainable model that's integrated with our operational goals, not something separate that's added on to everyday tasks. 
So as I turn it over to Michael, I want to once again thank the entire team for the incredible things you've already done and your passion to continually raise the bar. This year, I'm celebrating my 25th year at Target, so you might be tempted to think I've seen it all. But when I step back and realize what this team has accomplished in the last year under the most challenging of circumstances, it's clear that there is no limit to this team's potential, and there's no doubt that we have the best team in retail. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."
174438,706476635,2292413,"Target Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more",1721,"Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. 
On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more than offset all of the unique headwinds we faced over this challenging period, resulting in really strong performance. Target's total sales grew 23.3% in the first quarter, reflecting comp growth of 22.9%. Given last year's double-digit growth, first quarter sales have expanded more than 37% over the last 2 years, driven almost entirely by higher comps. Unlike last year, when consumers were consolidating trips and shopping less often, this year's comp growth was driven primarily by a traffic increase of more than 17% combined with a 5% increase in average ticket. 
As Brian mentioned, store comps were the growth engine this year, while digital was the primary driver in Q1 2020. As such, over the last 2 years, both our stores and digital channels have expanded their first quarter sales by more than $3 billion. This balance highlights the relevance and complementary nature of both channels in serving our guest needs. 
Our first quarter gross margin rate of 30% was 490 basis points ahead of last year when we faced a number of temporary headwinds, including markdowns and other costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. Compared with 2019, this year's first quarter gross margin rate was about 40 basis points higher, which is notable given that digital sales penetration more than doubled in that time, from 7.1% in 2019 to more than 18% this year. 
In terms of the year-over-year gross margin drivers, mix had a positive impact of about 150 basis points, reflecting the dramatic increase in apparel sales and continued strength in our home category. The remaining favorability was driven by core merchandising, as we continued to benefit from low promotional and clearance markdown rates, and we annualized last year's costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. The rate impact of supply chain and digital fulfillment costs was approximately neutral compared to last year, as the costs of outsized digital growth were offset by the benefit of a stronger mix of same-day fulfillment and our ongoing work to control unit costs across our entire suite of digital fulfillment options. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 18.6% this year, down more than 2 percentage points from 20.7% a year ago and 20.8% in 2019. In terms of drivers, leverage benefits have more than offset all of the extra costs we've absorbed over the last 2 years, including meaningfully higher pay and benefits for our team and other investments to protect the health and safety of our team and guests. 
While D&A expenses have grown in each of the last 2 years, this year's first quarter D&A expense rate was about 40 basis points lower than a year ago and about 80 basis points lower than 2019. 
Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate increased an astounding 7.4 percentage points compared with a year ago to an unprecedented 9.8% this year, from a temporary low of 2.4% rate a year ago. However, even compared to a very healthy 6.4% operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2019, this year's rate was more than 3 percentage points higher. In terms of dollars, first quarter operating income has more than doubled over the last 2 years. 
On the bottom line, our business delivered first quarter GAAP EPS of $4.17, up more than 600% from a year ago and well over double our 2019 GAAP EPS. On the adjusted EPS line, which excluded the gain from the sale of our DermStore business, we earned $3.69 this year, more than 500% higher than a year ago and well over double our 2019 adjusted EPS. 
As you know, our capital deployment priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we returned cash through our quarterly dividend, which we've maintained every quarter as a public company and grown every year since 1971. And finally, we returned excess cash over time through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A debt ratings. 
In the first quarter, we invested just over $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business. We continue to expect our full year CapEx will be approximately $4 billion, but the bulk of those expenditures will be more backloaded in the year, given the timing of this year's projects. 
We paid dividends of $340 million in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago, as growth in the per share dividend was partially offset by a decline in share count. And finally, we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, following a temporary pause in 2020, and deployed about $1.2 billion to retire 6.1 million shares at an average share price of just under $191. And in February, we completed the sale of our DermStore business, which contributed just over $350 million to our first quarter cash flow. 
Altogether, we ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. This was down about $700 million from the beginning of the quarter, but still well above where we expect to operate over time. With this cash, we'll be funding approximately $3.5 billion of additional CapEx in 2021 and we'll be recommending a robust increase in our quarterly dividends to the Board later this year. Beyond these uses, we should have ample capacity for continued share repurchases, and we'll continue to govern the magnitude and pace of repurchases in support of our goal to maintain our Middle A credit ratings. And given where we are today, it will likely be a multiyear journey before our debt metrics move fully back to where they've been over time. 
Now I'd like to turn briefly to our return on invested capital, which reflects both our operating results and the investments we've made to generate them. In the first quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC moved up to 30.7%, which is well over double the 13.4% we reported a year ago. While we've indicated that this measure will likely be volatile in the near term and could revert to a very healthy number, near 20% over time, the fact that our business has generated such a high after-tax return over the last 12 months is a testament both to the strength of our model and outstanding execution by our team. 
Now let me turn to our sales outlook. We learned a lot in the first quarter, and notably, got our first look at how our business is successfully comping the comp, with impressive growth on top of last year's strong surge in sales. Also, and importantly, we've continued to gain market share on top of last year's dramatic share gains. Based on these results, we're now planning for our business to deliver a mid- to high single-digit comp increase in the second quarter. This expectation is in line with the 2-year growth rates we saw in the first quarter. 
And while we only have a couple of weeks in the quarter behind us, the results we've seen so far this month are consistent with this outlook. The range for second quarter operating income remains wide, but should remain strong, far ahead of our 2019 rate of 7.2%, but perhaps not fully as high as last year's unprecedented rate of 10%. 
In terms of the specific puts and takes in the quarter, we'll be comping over last year's reversal of the return reserve estimate, which added about $110 million to last year's operating income. In addition, this year, we're making purposeful investments in store labor hours to ensure we deliver outstanding service and stronger in-stocks than a year ago, when sales grew far beyond our expectations. Of course, we'll continue to benefit from meaningful sales leverage, given that we're planning for healthy growth on top of last year's record-setting increase. Putting that all together, we expect to see continued strong performance on this line. 
In the back half of the year, the range of possibilities for comp growth is also quite wide, and we'll gain more insights as the year progresses. As of today, based on our recent results and confidence going forward, we expect to see positive single-digit comps in the back half of the year, on top of last year's unprecedented performance. 
Regarding our full year operating margin rate, following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we have increasing confidence in the consumer and industry backdrop in the back half of the year. As such, the range of outcomes for our 2021 operating margin rate has moved significantly higher. So despite the anticipated headwind from higher markdown rates following last year's historically low rates, we believe that our business is positioned to deliver a full year operating margin rate that's well over last year's rate of 7%. More specifically, we believe this year's operating margin rate could reach 8% or perhaps a little higher. We'll continue to refine our view throughout the year. 
As the team looks ahead to the rest of the year, they're focused on staying agile in what continues to be a volatile environment. Rather than placing all of their bets on a single forecast number, they're focused on contingency planning, creating flexibility that will allow us to react to unexpected changes, and importantly, take advantage of opportunity when we see it. 
We're also excited about the investments still ahead of us and the growth they'll create: hundreds more remodels; dozens of new stores; new Ulta and Apple shopping environments; and supply chain investments to support both replenishment and fulfillment. Given the performance we're seeing today, which is the product of the investments we've made over the last few years, we're eagerly leading into future opportunities to enable more profitable, high-return growth over time. 
Before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to add my voice and thanks to the team. The value our team members are creating for our business, communities, shareholders and each other goes far beyond what we can measure in a P&L. Thanks for making Target an even stronger company on behalf of all of our stakeholders.

I'm thankful for their continued focus on our guests, focus on operational excellence and passion for our brand. 
I also want to acknowledge the challenges facing our India headquarter team, along with our team members who have family there, given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We have been carefully monitoring conditions on the ground and providing extra support to our team during this difficult time to ensure they can take care of themselves and their families. We've also funded $500,000 donation to UNICEF set to increase access to option treatment in hospitals across the country and bring testing resources to the hardest hit communities. We're hopeful that conditions there will continue to improve. 
So now as we get ready to move to your questions, I want to underscore the confidence you've heard throughout our remarks today. Coming off an unbelievable year in 2020, we had a lot of confidence as we entered 2021, but our first quarter results came in far ahead of our baseline expectations. 
With the macro and consumer backdrop that's been surprisingly positive, we've seen remarkable momentum in our performance, even as we started to comp over the period of peak increases a year ago. The flexibility of our category mix and fulfillment options, combined with an agile, energetic and engaged team, continue to resonate with our guests, driving double-digit traffic growth and an increase in average tickets in the first quarter. 
But as you've often heard me say, we shouldn't confuse performance with potential. So even after more than a year of unprecedented growth, we're seeing focus and leaning into the opportunities ahead of us, making investments to build on an already strong foundation. With these investments, I'm confident that our business model and outstanding team will continue to raise the bar on an already best-in-class retail experience, resulting in even stronger loyalty and guest engagement over time. 
With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions."

And we have always said, we like it for a couple of reasons: One, great guest service; and two, better economics. Same-day services are that on steroids. They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home because, as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home. So if we take that out of the equation, then we end up with economics that are much closer to the store transaction. 
The thing we love about all of the same-day services, pick up, Drive-Up and ship, all of them continue to grow faster than our overall digital growth, and we continue to find ways to improve them, as you said. Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart, to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store so that we don't end up with what we call, INFs, or items not found. 
And then we continue to invest in helping them physically. And that's a big focus for us this year and will be over the next couple of years. In the case of Drive-Up, which as we've talked about a couple of times, Brian talked about and I talked about, has been our fastest-growing same-day service since -- basically since we started it. It also has our highest NPS score, so guests love it. We let you decide when you want to come. We don't force you into a time slot. And then our team brings it out to you in 2 minutes or less. So our guests absolutely love that. And you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. 
Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature control products to Drive-Up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well. 
So every year, our team comes up with multiple ways to continue to improve the service, first and foremost, for the guest, and then on the back end, improve things for our team so they can execute it easier as we continue to grow. So we see a lot more opportunity for us. And as I said, that will be a big part of our capital investment over the next several years."

Well, first off, Karen, we feel really good about our inventory position heading into the second quarter. And you can see we're up on a year-over-year basis, and we should be given the growth in sales that we've seen and continue to expect. 
When it comes to markdowns through the balance of the year, we've talked about this a little bit previously, we were sold through in a lot of seasons last year, and that's not optimal for us. We don't want to look at empty shelves at the end of a seasonal set. And so with our anticipation for growth in the remainder of this year, we'll be buying appropriately to that. And hopefully, that means we've got fuller shelves at the end of a season. And with that, will come some clearance markdowns, there will be a little bit of a drag on markdown rates on a year-over-year basis if I had to guess. But I would welcome a little bit of that rate drag because it means that we're full and in stock for the guests throughout the season."

Worth noting, and I touched on this as well, there's some factors unique to the quarter. We've got a $110 million headwind from the way our returns reserve calendarizes between Q1 and Q2. And the second thing is, we're investing, and we'll continue to invest in the team and in-store payroll to make sure we're staffed and in stock to support the sales we expect to come. And our teams have done just an incredible job this year providing such great guest experience. And we want to make sure we're investing to continue to support that and to support growth."

And so those are familiar drivers we've talked about over time. Where those drivers land for the balance of the year will dictate where margin ultimately falls."

And so let's invest in our team, give them a great experience. And you've seen us do that for several years now. We've invested in wages. We've invested in benefits. Just as importantly, we've invested in training to help upskill them. And then over the course of the past 1.5 years or so, we've invested in safety very overtly. 
And so as Brian said, engagement is very high. Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store's at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right? We get team members that know their jobs. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they're in there weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them. 
And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019. So we're just getting started on this journey, but the early results are very encouraging. And I would just finish where Brian did.

We didn't see pressure on the supply chain and digital line this quarter. That's due in part to the just incredible strength in our store business, with stores up 18% on a year-over-year basis. 
I get excited by the efficiency improvements I see us continue to make in our digital experience. John talked to some of those just a minute ago. But we can do a lot with the volumes that we've built over the last 2 years in some of those same-day services. And all of that volume translates to more efficiency opportunity as we can continue to squeeze down the per unit cost to fulfill. 
But I don't shy away from growth -- or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omnichannel guests, more guests using Drive-Up, more guests using same-day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new Drive-Up or Shipt guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth, and that's how we continue to think about it."

I'd say we're still firmly in crawl here in Minneapolis. And so we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. But the play here is a couple of things. 
And first of all, it's about capacity in the stores. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space, and that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store. And that's an important thing for us. Then as we move downstream, the more granular sort is where we start to see potentially cost reductions as we can sort to provide to our carrier partners further downstream in their operations. And like we'd announced about a month ago, using the Deliv technology, creating local routes for local packages, we can get very efficient on delivery using Shipt and Shipt drivers. And so put all that together and our guest gets a great experience, we create more capacity. And we have the opportunity to continue to improve what we believe are already advantaged economics because of our stores-as-hub model. So more to come on all that. It's early days, but we remain pretty optimistic on all 3 of those fronts."

Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate world-class team. As you know, w",1520,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate world-class team. 
As you know, we've been investing for years to build a durable model that's in place today, one that puts our guests first and leverages all of our assets and capabilities to serve their evolving wants and needs. After years of investment and effort in building this model, it's clear that we've only begun to scratch the surface of what's possible over time. 
In the second quarter, our business continued to perform and grow on both the top and bottom lines, even as we comped over record performance a year ago. Of course, seeing growth on top of growth is nothing new. Our business is already delivering consistent increases in sales and profitability in the years leading up to the pandemic. This was followed by a dramatic acceleration in 2020 and this year's continued growth. 
In the second quarter, Target's comparable sales increased 8.9% on top of a record 24.3% growth a year ago. As a result, second quarter total sales have expanded more than 36% or more than $6.6 billion over the last 2 years. 
On the bottom line, we earned second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.64, up nearly 8% compared with last year and double our performance 2 years ago. 
As we described last quarter, guests have emerged from a year in which digital was the primary growth driver and they're now returning to our stores in droves. As a result, the majority of our second quarter growth was driven by the stores channel, where comps grew 8.7% on top of 10.9% a year ago. In addition, traffic accounted for more than 100% of our second quarter growth, in contrast to a year ago when guests were limiting time out of their homes and the bulk of our growth was coming from bigger transactions. 
Comparable digital sales grew 10% in the second quarter, building on the record growth of 195% last year. The digital channel continues to be led by our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 55% this year on top of more than 270% last year. Given their rapid expansion, same-day services now account for well over half of our digital sales. Among those same-day options, Drive Up has quickly grown to be the largest, accounting for more sales than pickup and Shipt combined. To put it in dollar terms, over the last 2 years, second quarter sales through Drive Up alone have increased by nearly $1.4 billion. And for the spring season, they've expanded by double that amount. 
Beyond our fulfillment options, we continue to benefit from our unique multi-category assortment, which is perfectly positioned to serve our guests' evolving wants and needs. As a result, [indiscernible] sales in all 5 of our core categories expanded in the second quarter on top of strong growth a year ago. As expected, Apparel continued to lead the way as our guests continue to respond to newness and style across both our owned and national brands throughout the assortment. Also as expected, we saw more moderate growth in our Hardlines and Home categories this year as they expanded on top of really strong comparisons from a year ago. And notably, we continue to benefit from impressive performance across our less discretionary Food & Beverage and Essential categories. These categories have consistently delivered strong growth and market share gains, both in 2020 and again this year. I'll let Christina provide more details in a few minutes. 
When we talk with many of you about what's driving target performance, we often hear the question, ""What's the one thing that's been the key?"" The honest answer to that question, we can't point to any one thing. Rather, it's been everything working together that's driven our performance. This includes our supply chain work, which has positioned our stores as [indiscernible] hubs, while transforming the way we replenish store inventory. Then there's our rollout of same-day services, which began more than 5 years ago with in-store pickup, followed by the nationwide rollout of Drive Up and Shipt beginning in 2018. 
And there's the refreshment of our own brands, which began in 2016 with the rollout of Cat & Jack, followed by dozens of new owned brands over the last 5 years. 
At the same time, we've expanded our partnerships with premium national brands, including Disney, Levis and Apple and, most recently, this month's opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop in shops. Across our store portfolio, we began testing small formats in 2014. And  we now have more than 140 of these productive neighborhood locations across the country. 
We've also remodeled more than half the chain over the last 4 years, transforming the shopping environment while optimizing the lab in support of our same-day services. 
And we've reinvented our store operating model, focusing on enhanced service and subject matter expertise in key categories while investing in visual merchandising across our network. 
Then there's Target Circle, which launched in 2019 and now has more than 100 million members, providing a new connection with our guests while offering meaningful rewards. 
And of course, we made multiple investments in our team, including the attainment of our goal to bring Target's nationwide starting wage up to $15 or more. This was certainly an important milestone, but far from the end of the journey. Just a few weeks ago, we announced an investment of more than $75 million to provide $200 recognition bonuses to all of our frontline, hourly, full-time and part-time team members across our stores, distribution centers and contact centers. 
I've said it many times before, but I can't say it enough. Our team is a lifeblood of Target. And our success begins and ends with them. I want to thank each of them and every one of them across the world for everything they do to make Target such a special place to shop and a great place to work and build a rewarding career. 
And today, given the profitable growth that comes from all of these efforts, we can continue to invest in making our business even stronger and more durable over time. In June, we were incredibly excited to launch Target Forward, an ambitious new sustainability strategy grounded in the vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future with our guests, partners and communities. 
Target Forward is centered around 3 critical ambitions: to design and elevate sustainable brands, innovate to eliminate waste and accelerate opportunity and equity. This bold initiative is the beginning of the new chapter for how we'll define sustainability, position our business for long-term growth and resiliency and build on our rich legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices. 
As part of these efforts, in early August we announced that this fall, Target will be rolling out an industry-leading program to provide debt-free educational assistance for all of our U.S.-based full-time and part-time team members. This program will provide access to more than 250 business-aligned programs at more than 40 educational institutions, including historical black colleges and universities, along with institutions serving the Hispanic community. In total, we plan to spend $200 million to offer this benefit over the next 4 years, serving as a meaningful example of how we're investing to promote opportunity and equity in our communities, beginning with our own team. 
So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to acknowledge the likelihood that the second half of the year will continue to be volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant. Of course, safety remains our #1 priority, as evident in the way we operate our stores and our ongoing investments to encourage vaccinations by making them easy and accessible for both our team and our guests. 
In terms of our business, the last 18 months have proven, beyond a doubt, the flexibility and resilience of both our team and our business model. And while sales in stores have been soaring so far this year, our operations and team have demonstrated how they can pivot seamlessly between stores and digital commerce based on how our guests choose to shop. 
I also want to emphasize that as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we see many more productive opportunities to invest in continued growth. 
And I also want to acknowledge the continued high level of execution we've been seeing across all of our teams. As John will outline in more detail, despite unusually high volatility for well over a year now, the Target team has been consistently setting the industry standard in terms of execution despite multiple challenges in the external environment. Our team continues to embrace every challenge as one aligned Target team, taking care of each other as they focus on serving our guests. I am truly inspired by their work and grateful to share the outstanding performance they're delivering quarter after quarter, year after year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina."

Our guests is at the forefront of every decision we make. By listening intently to them, anticipating their wants and needs and building our strategy around them, we can drive deeper engagement, trust and a stronger preference for Target over time. We built our same-day capabilities with that guest-first focus. And as we've shared before, when guests try services like Drive Up or Shipt for the first time, their overall spending increases, including an increase in conventional store shopping. In other words, digital engagement drives more engagement in our stores, providing us with more and more opportunities to surprise, delight and inspire them. This is one example of many showing how growth today creates a platform for additional growth in the future. 
And of course, we wouldn't be where we are today without the best team in retail. So I want to take a moment and thank our entire team for delivering superior performance in a continued volatile environment even as they face ongoing challenges presented by the Delta variant, product cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and more. 
Target's second quarter performance also demonstrates the strength and durability of our business model. Our unique, multi-category assortment offers the right balance of what our guests want and need even as they change, sometimes rapidly. As a result, despite record-setting growth last year, all 5 of our core merchandising categories grew again this year, proving that there's still plenty of runway ahead. 
Second quarter results were strongest in Apparel, which delivered mid-teens growth on top of low double-digit growth last year. Within Apparel, swim, kids and young contemporary all delivered comps in the low 20% range. 
Food & Beverage delivered low double-digit growth in the second quarter. Performance was led by our bakery, cafe and deli businesses, which grew more than 50% as these departments were closed during part of the second quarter last year. We also saw double-digit growth in our fresh categories, benefiting from an expansion in the number of items available for Drive Up. In fact, nearly half of this year's growth in our produce business has been driven by the growth in Drive Up orders. 
The Essentials and Beauty category delivered high single-digit growth this quarter. Within Essentials, Baby Care grew by more than 20%, and we saw mid to high teens growth in both pets and health care. Beauty continued to gain market share on comp growth in the high single-digit range in advance of this month's rollout of our in-store partnership with Ulta Beauty. 
Hardlines delivered mid-single-digit growth this quarter on top of more than 40% growth a year ago. We continue to benefit from strong momentum in toys, which grew in the low 20% range. Sporting goods was also a standout with growth in the high teens. As expected, Electronics experienced a moderate comp decline in the mid-single-digit range as it comped over last year's growth of more than 70% during a period when some competitors were closed. Importantly, over the last 2 years, both Hardlines and Electronics have delivered strong growth and market share gains. 
And finally, in Home, following comp growth of more than 30% last year, we saw a low single-digit increase in the second quarter. Within Home, we've seen moderating trends in categories like kitchen, storage and decor as they comped over outsized growth last year. At the same time, given our guests' increasing focus on gathering and celebrating holidays and family milestones, we've seen an acceleration in our seasonal and stationary categories, providing another example of the power of our broad multi-category model. 
And beyond individual categories, our diverse collection of owned brands continues to grow and provide differentiation across our assortment. In the second quarter, owned brand sales outpaced the company with growth in the mid-teens. And in Food & Beverage, where we're seeing tremendous growth in Good & Gather and encouraging results in our new brand, Favorite Day, we saw an increase in owned brand penetration of about 70 basis points compared with last year. 
As we look ahead, despite uncertainties around the Delta variant and rising COVID cases, consumers have healthy balance sheets and remain eager to find safe ways to connect with their loved ones and find some sense of normalcy. We'll continue to safely meet their needs and add some much needed joy. 
First on that list is this month's launch of Ulta Beauty at Target, the next chapter in Target's already strong beauty story. The shared values and cultures between our businesses and our collective desire to inspire and elevate the shopping experience make this long-term partnership a major win for both companies and our guests. And like our guests, we're incredibly excited to see this new concept come to life following months of anticipation. 
But our guests aren't just excited for their glow up to their beauty game, they're also looking for affordable options to refresh their wardrobe as they cautiously plan for more in-person interactions this fall. So it's perfect timing that this September, Target is partnering with 4 dynamic and highly regarded designers, Nili Lotan, Rachel Comey, Sandy Liang and Victor Glemaud, to create a limited time, size-inclusive apparel collection of modern and classic wardrobe staples. 
And our partnerships go well beyond Apparel and Beauty. In Home, we've enlisted the talent of Justina Blakeney, Jungalow founder and long-time partner to bring Junglalow's cozy, wild and free vibe into our Open House line, making it the perfect addition to our [indiscernible] brand. 
And for our littler guests, our newest design partnership is sure to inspire their imagination and help them to create some great new looks. Christian Robinson for Target, a full wonder creation of the beloved artist, illustrator and children's book author is a limited edition collection that includes home goods, apparel and books for kids and baby. 
And last, not least, for the furrier family members in your household, we have just launched Kindfull, our new pet food-owned brand focusing on healthy, sustainable and affordable food options for our beloved 4-legged friends. 
Beyond partnerships and product launches, our guests are telling us they're hungry to celebrate key holidays, life moments and everyday occasions with their loved ones, having missed out on so many of them over the last 18 months. So even as they're mindful of the ongoing risks, our guests are carefully balancing caution, with optimism and focusing on finding safe and affordable ways to celebrate. 
Already in progress, the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons are off to a great start, regardless of whether back-to-school will be in-person or hybrid, Target has everything they need to be successful in any learning environment. 
Similarly, as college freshmen look to move on to campus for the first time, our merchandising and inventory plans account for the fact that many sophomores find themselves in that same position having attended their first year of college in a completely virtual environment. 
Given the stresses that come with the start of school, Target is focused on making things as easy as possible for families with School List Assist. This feature online and in the Target app allows users to easily find their school-specific supply list and either shop by item or add the whole list with a click of a button. 
And like we did for holiday last year, our back-to-school offers will be spread throughout the entire season, providing both value and a safe shopping experience for our guests. This reflects our ongoing focus on providing value that goes far beyond price. It's about affordability and accessibility all season long. 
And on that topic of providing value, we're rolling out new functionality in the Target app based on hearing from our guests that the fear of missing out on a deal is real, something affectionately known as promo fomo. With this update, when guests add items to their cart, the app will automatically show them all the applicable Target Circle offers before checking out, reassuring them that they won't miss out on a great deal. 
Looking ahead, we'll soon be trading in shorts and t-shirts for cozy sweaters and denim as we usher in the fall. And for Halloween, no matter how you plan to celebrate, Target has a few tricks and no shortage of treats up our sleeves. We'll continue to focus on value and inspiration with affordable and exciting costumes, including a broader-than-ever array of adaptive, size-inclusive and gender-neutral options. And of course, we'll have all the sweet treats for self-indulgence and sharing with others, including great new offerings from our [ Heiden EQ ] and Favorite Day owned brands. 
Beyond our near-term plans, what energizes me the most is our focus on creating a more equitable, sustainable and inclusive world. This is why I'm so proud of our recently announced sustainability strategy, Target Forward, which is a comprehensive vision that touches every aspect of our business in support of people and planet. 
You've heard me talk about my role on Target's REACH Committee, which was formed with the goal of achieving lasting, systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities, serving as a perfect extension of the broader Target Forward strategy. The recruitment and retention of more diverse team members, more products from diverse suppliers, a new direction for our philanthropic efforts in communities of color and more equity for all, these are unwavering commitments in support of our goals. 
While there's much more to accomplish, I'm pleased with the progress we've already made. One example is our commitment to increase black representation across our company by 20% by the year 2023. To date, we've seen progress at all salaried levels, most notably in a nearly 25% increase among our company officers. 
So while it's incredibly rewarding to see how well our business is performing, I'm most proud of our commitment to invest in the long-term health of our team, our communities and the planet. Our company purpose, focus on sustainability and then creating a more equitable and inclusive world, these are not a collection of separate initiatives tacked onto our core business. Rather, they are the bedrock of who we are and how we make decisions. While their benefit may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, I strongly believe that they're the foundation of how we'll grow our business, sustain our communities and move forward together over time. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John."

So it probably comes as no surprise that I'm naturally interested in machines and automation. And obviously, when our team works to optimize Target's operations, both for today and in the future, we have access to every available tool and technology, robotics, automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. But when we choose to invest in technology, we're not looking to remove the human element from the target experience. Instead, we're investing to enhance the productivity of our team members, freeing them up to focus on what's most important, like serving our guests. 
This is another example of the power of 'and' and how it runs through every part of our business. The choice doesn't have to be about people or technology. We can invest in both people and their productivity. Here's one way to think about it. In our 2015 annual report, we reported that Target had around 341,000 team members as we entered 2016, a year in which our business generated just over $69 billion in sales. 5 years later, our 2020 annual report showed that we had about 409,000 team members going into this year, representing about 20% growth in the number of team members over that 5-year period. However, based on our results so far and our expectations for the back half of the year, our business is positioned to deliver more than $100 billion in sales this year, representing growth of 45% or more compared with 5 years ago. So even as we've added nearly 70,000 people to our team, we've also benefited from a significant increase in their productivity, creating financial capacity to provide enhanced service for our guests and make significant investments in pay and benefits. 
And as Brian mentioned, our team has been performing at an incredibly high level, raising the bar on historically strong execution. Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw an improvement in already high Net Promoter Scores for all 3 of our same-day services, most notably for the in-store pickup experience. In addition, Drive Up, which remains our highest-rated service, saw an increase in guest satisfaction compared with last year, on top of last year's improvements over 2019. 
And we continue to find ways to enhance our industry-leading pickup and Drive Up capabilities. In the second quarter, we added another 5,000 items to the assortment available for pickup and Drive Up, ranging from items in adult beverages to fresh pet food, meal kits and green cards. We also continue to roll out technology enhancements, including functionality to provide backup suggestions when an item is unavailable, a chain-wide rollout of numbered parking spaces for guests using Drive Up and the ability in the app to seamlessly designate an alternate person to pick up an order. 
Beyond same-day capabilities, we also saw a meaningful increase in satisfaction with our in-store shopping experience driven by improvements across multiple attributes, most notably around team member interactions, both on the sales floor and at checkout. 
These increases reflect the impact of our new service initiatives, which focus on serving our guests on their own terms, while authentically bringing our company purpose to life through the guest experience. This spring, more than 300,000 team members completed training on these initiatives, offering them tools to provide a consistent, differentiated shopping experience regardless of how our guests choose to shop. Higher guest satisfaction scores provide clear evidence that our team has enthusiastically embraced this training as they build their confidence and expertise in establishing authentic connections with our guests. 
As Christina mentioned, our teams at headquarters have also done a great job as they navigate multiple challenges across the supply chain. And while we're happy that in-stocks have improved meaningfully compared with a year ago, we have more work to do as our guests are still seeing empty shelves on some occasions. In some of those situations, we've simply sold beyond our expectations, and our team is working quickly to secure additional quantities. In other cases, the vendors themselves are facing constraints in their ability to deliver product. And we're collaborating with them to address these constraints together, securing as much product as possible on behalf of our guests. 
And our team has been successfully addressing supply chain bottlenecks, which are affecting both domestic freight and international shipping. Steps include expedited ordering and larger upfront quantities in advance of a season, mitigating the risk that replenishment could take longer than usual. 
Bottom line, with Q2 ending inventory up more than 26% or nearly $2.5 billion compared with a year ago, we believe we're well positioned for the fall and ready to deliver strong growth on top of last year's record increases. 
In everyday life, when you see an artist, performer or athlete who's at the top of their craft, they typically make their work look simple. The mastery they've achieved makes it easy to look past all the effort and passion behind their high level of performance. That's true in business as well. When you see a successful company generating impressive growth on both the top line and the bottom line, it's easy to miss the passion and hard work of the team that's delivering that performance. So as always, I want to pause and thank our team members everywhere in the world for everything they do to propel our business forward regardless of the challenges that come their way. 
Our properties team has had a busy year as they ramp up our remodel program following last year's temporary suspension. In addition, they're working to open new neighborhood stores, distribution centers and sortation centers across the country. More than 100 remodel projects are currently in flight, and we're on track to complete about 140 remodels in 2021 and an even higher number in 2022. The team has also opened 19 new stores this year, spanning from 3 more stores in New York City to all the way across the country in Hollywood. We're on track to open 12 more stores this fall, including a new location in Orlando adjacent to Disney World, a new site in Hawaii and a campus location in Madison, Wisconsin, welcome news to all my fellow Badgers out there. 
We opened 2 new distribution facilities in the second quarter, 1 in New Jersey and another near Chicago, creating additional replenishment capacity within our network. 
We're planning to add more capacity in 2022, given the sales growth we've already sustained over the last 1.5 years and the continued growth we expect to generate going forward. 
And to support our ship-from-store capability, the team is getting ready to open 2 new sortation centers in October, followed by 2 more after the holidays. These new facilities offer faster delivery times at a lower cost in markets with a high density of shipments. In addition, they free up backroom space at store locations they serve, expanding capacity for more digital growth over time. 
And finally, in support of our commitment to being a net 0 enterprise by 2040, the team is driving towards 0 waste to landfill in our U.S. operations and improving overall energy efficiency as we transition to renewable energy. This includes investing in contracts for off-site renewable energy and additional rooftop solar projects as we move beyond our 2020 goal of having rooftop solar at 500 facilities. 
So it's clear we have many opportunities to invest capital productively across both our stores and the broader supply chain. But I want to end my remarks where I started: with our team. I've been at target for 25 years now, and one of the many reasons I've stated here is the way we've always invested in our team, creating a uniquely strong culture and a high level of engagement. But in recent years, we've doubled down on what was already a strength. Obviously, this includes our investments in pay, including our starting wage, but it goes much further. We've also made investments in benefits and recently announced that several programs we added during the pandemic have now become ongoing benefits for all U.S.-based team members, including free access to health care through virtual doctor visits and free online resources and apps to support mental, emotional and physical health. 
And as Brian mentioned, in support of Target Forward's ambitions to advance opportunity in equity and create an equitable and inclusive workforce, we are really proud and excited to announce our new debt-free education assistance program earlier this month. We have the most comprehensive program in the industry, offering more than 340,000 team members debt-free access to undergraduate degrees, certificates, certifications and more, beginning with their first day at Target. Importantly, the program pays for smaller out-of-pocket costs, such as textbooks and course fees that might otherwise hinder participation. And for those who want to continue beyond their undergraduate education, the program will pay up to $10,000 annually for team members pursuing a master's degree. 
As Brian has said many times, of all the investments we've made over the last 5 years, none have been more impactful than the ones we've made in our team. And like any investment that's generating a high return, we continue to look for opportunities to do more, deepening our team's connection with Target, while they deepen Target's relationship with our guests. 
Because of the investments we've made over time, store team member turnover remains low at a time when the labor market has been heating up to levels we haven't seen in a very long time. That's one of the many reasons I'm grateful to serve alongside this great team, and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."

After a record year in 2020, the theme of this year's performance has been growth on top of growth. Of course, we laid the groundwork for this year's growth through the investment decisions we were making years ago in our stores, owned brands, supply chain, technology and our team. And today, we continue to see a host of opportunities to invest in our future. That certainly includes the capital we're investing in support of our stores and supply chain and the investments we're making in our team, including recently announced team member bonuses and our new debt-free education assistance program. And while the return on team member investments isn't measured as a distinct line in our financial statements, they're the most important investments we make. 
Total sales grew 9.4% in the second quarter, driven by comp growth of 8.9%. Within the quarter, May saw the smallest increase this year, given that it was comping over a 33% increase a year ago. On a 2-year basis, results were much more consistent throughout the quarter, as we saw 2-year growth in excess of 30% across all 3 months. 
As Brian mentioned, with guests spending more time out of their homes, we've seen them shopping more often and making slightly smaller trips. Specifically, traffic grew 12.7% in the second quarter, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in average ticket. However, given that last year's comp growth was primarily driven by average ticket, on a 2-year basis, we've seen double-digit increases in both traffic and ticket since 2019. 
As Brian also mentioned, the store channel has been our primary growth driver this year. Specifically, store comparable sales grew 8.7% in the second quarter. And given that store comps increased 10.9% last year, we've seen compounded growth of our in-store sales of more than 20% over the last 2 years. 
In the digital channel, comp sales grew 10% on top of 195% a year ago. And reflecting this year's change in guests' shopping habits, the mix of our digital fulfillment changed meaningfully. Specifically, same-day services grew 55% in the quarter, while sales on orders shipped to home actually declined from last year's elevated levels. This provides vivid evidence of the stickiness of our same-day services. Once guests try them, they love them. So even as they've ramped up their in-store shopping, they've continued to rely on these services as well. 
Another indication of this year's shift in guest behavior, the percent of total sales from the digital channel actually fell slightly compared with last year, moving from 17.2% in second quarter 2020 back to 17% this year. Obviously, this isn't a trend we expect will continue over time, and it's important to note that this year's digital penetration of 17% is well over double the 7.3% we reported in second quarter 2019. 
Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was down about 50 basis points from 30.9% a year ago. Among the drivers, last year's change in the sales return reserve estimate, which contributed about $110 million to second quarter gross margin last year, accounted for about 50 basis points of rate pressure this year. In other words, without last year's benefit from this change in the reserve estimate, our second quarter gross margin rate would have been about flat compared to last year. 
Among other gross margin drivers, we saw about 70 basis points of pressure in merchandising, reflecting the impact of higher product and freight costs, partially offset by the benefit of low markdown rates. This pressure was offset by about 40 basis points of tailwind for merchandise mix, combined with a small benefit from supply chain and digital fulfillment, driven by the shift in digital mix toward our less costly same-day options. 
On the SG&A expense line, we saw a rate of 19.3% this year, down about 10 basis points from last year. This change reflected the continued leverage benefit from strong sales growth, offset by pressure from an increase in some expense rates in areas like marketing from lower-than-normal levels a year ago. This year's SG&A expenses also reflect continued growth in pay and benefits for our team. 
On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from last year, driven by leverage on our sales growth. 
Altogether, second quarter operating margin rate was 9.8%, down about 20 basis points from a year ago, but more than 2.5 percentage points higher than second quarter 2019. 
On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP EPS of $3.65 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $3.64 was 7.9% above last year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS have both doubled over the last 2 years. 
So far this year, our operations have generated just over $3.4 billion of cash. This is historically strong performance, but about $1.7 billion lower than a year ago due to some unique circumstances affecting last year. Specifically, our inventory position at the end of the second quarter last year was much lower than we'd have preferred given that our sales had far outpaced our expectations during the first half of the year. As a result, at this point last year, inventory turnover and payables leverage were running unusually high and would have been lower had we owned the appropriate amount of inventory to support our sales. As such, this year, our inventory is in a much better position, more than $2 billion higher than last year, and our payables leverage has begun to decline to a more sustainable level, both of which are near-term headwinds to operating cash flow. In addition, our year-to-date income tax payments are more than $1 billion higher than at this time last year, given the volatility in our taxable income through the first half of last year. 
As I turn to capital deployment, I want to start where I always do, which is to reiterate our priorities, which have remained the same for decades. First, we invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual dividend increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we return any excess cash over time through share repurchases within the limits of our strong middle A credit ratings. 
So far this year, we've invested just over $1.3 billion in CapEx to support the new store, remodel and supply chain projects that John outlined earlier. And for the year, we're now expecting CapEx in the $3.5 billion range. This is about $0.5 billion lower than our original expectation and reflects the retiming of some project spending into next year. As a result of this retiming, our view of next year's CapEx is somewhat higher than our prior view, in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. And we'll continue to refine our view as we move into next year. 
Bottom line, we're excited about the productive opportunities in front of us and we'll govern our investment decisions with a focus on delivering continued growth and superior returns. 
Beyond our capital investments, we paid dividends of $336 million in the second quarter, and we returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases at an average price of just over $230. 
And as we announced today, our board has approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which will allow us to continue buying back shares once the current $5 billion program is completed. This authorization is consistent with the capital deployment priorities I outlined above. It also reflects our confidence in the ongoing strength of our business and the robust cash flow we expect to generate over time. 
Even after this year's investments in our business and team and the return of capital to our shareholders, we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $7.4 billion. This is up slightly from a year ago and well above the cash position we expect to maintain over time. But as I've said before, given our current cash position and elevated volatility in the current environment, we believe it will be a multiyear journey before our exceptionally strong cash and credit metrics move fully back to long-term levels consistent with our single A credit ratings. 
Before I turn to our expectations, I want to close my review of our current performance with a brief discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the performance of our investment decisions over time. 
For the trailing 12 months through the end of the second quarter, Target's after-tax ROIC was 31.7% compared with 17.2% a year ago. This is an amazing number and a testament to the performance of our business model and our team over the last year. As we've said before, we expect this metric could settle back into the mid to high 20s over time, but to deliver a sustainable after-tax return in that range is a remarkable performance in any industry. And these superior returns are one of the many reasons we're eager to continue investing in the growth and resilience of our business to the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
Now let's turn to our comp sales expectations for the fall season. As you'll recall, in our conference call 90 days ago, we described how our business was positioned to deliver single-digit comp growth in the back half of the year, on top of very strong growth of more than 20% in the back half of 2020. While the environment remains volatile today, and there are many uncertainties as we look ahead, Target's performance through the first half of the year has consistently exceeded our expectations. This performance, combined with the continued strength in the U.S. consumer, gives us increasing confidence that this fall our business can generate comparable sales growth in the high single-digit range, near the high end of our previous guidance range. 
We have a similar outlook regarding profitability. 90 days ago, we said we expected our full year operating margin rate would be well above the 2020 rate of 7%, with a potential for it to reach 8% or somewhat higher. From today's perspective, based on our expectation of high single-digit comp growth in the fall, we expect to see an operating margin rate near the high end of our previous range. Specifically, we now believe that Target is positioned to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher for the full year. 
I've been at Target for more than 17 years now, and I've never experienced a time like this when every aspect of our diverse strategy is coming together like we're seeing today. Obviously, our guests are noticing, too, based on their higher level of engagement, which you can see in our outstanding performance. 
Typically, in retail, if you saw a large, mature company like ours growing at the rate we're seeing today, you'd assume we were comping over soft numbers from the prior year. Instead, we're comping over a year of record growth in 2020 on both the top and bottom lines. 
Like Brian said earlier, our success begins and ends with the team. So on behalf of all of our stakeholders, I'd like to close my remarks today by thanking the entire Target team for the exceptional results we're reporting today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian."

Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on Michael's last point, which is the way we've been able to synchronize every aspect of our strategy. A few years ago, we embarked on a project to better articulate our company purpose. Across our team, there was already a strong sense of who we are and what we stand for, but we wanted to put it into words distinctly. 
Out of that work came the purpose we articulate today: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Those words have deep meaning for our team, families, discovery, joy and the word all, which represents our strong commitment to inclusion across every aspect of our business. 
Some might ask if everyone at Target already had a strong sense of purpose, why go to the trouble of putting it into words? The answer is the alignment that it creates: alignment of our strategy and alignment of our team.

If we find ourselves working on something that doesn't advance our purpose, we can set it aside and relentlessly focus on the things that will move Target forward. That kind of focus has enabled the performance we're reporting today, and it's behind all of our investments, strategies and activities as we look ahead.

And I think the second quarter is a really good example of that. If you take out the sales return adjustment in last year's actuals, margins were essentially flat year-over-year. And so we found some good offsets there and feel really good about our profit performance. I actually think that same theme comes through loud and clear if we zoom out a little bit and look at a longer time period. If you go back to first half of this year versus first half of 2019, 2019 gross margin rate was 30.1% for the Q1 and Q2 season. We're sitting at 30.4% right now in Q2 and 30.2% for the spring. And so a lot's happened over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about our ability to manage the profitability of the business.

So all 3 of those are acting incrementally each year and not taking business away from each other. And as you know, the thing we love about that, it's a great service for our guests. They're our highest-rated services. Drive Up is the single highest-rated service we have. But also for us, it's fast and very, very efficient.

The other side is just improving the service itself, and you'll see us continue to do that. We added more Drive Up locations. We're adding canopies to help with the weather. We added number parking lots so that we can find your black SUV among the 12 black SUVs that sit out in our parking lot waiting for Drive Up at any given time. And we added substitutions. And we added the ability to add another driver to come -- do your pickup order for you. 
So I think you'll see us to continue to innovate the service as well. So we see a long runway for us to continue to improve driveway.

On your question about, is the assortment expanding? Or is it really the expansion on to Drive Up? The assortment is always going to be a curated point of view. But when the guest starts in the digital experience rather than the physical experience, there is much more understanding of who we are and they quickly are converting because of that convenience in Drive Up to Target Food & Beverage.

Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate, world-class team. As you know,",1521,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate, world-class team. 
As you know, we've been investing for years to build the durable model that's in place today, one that puts our guests first and leverages all of our assets and capabilities to serve their evolving wants and needs. After years of investment and effort in building this model, it's clear that we've only begun to scratch the surface of what's possible over time.
In the second quarter, our business continued to perform and grow on both the top and bottom lines, even as we comped over record performance a year ago. Of course, seeing growth on top of growth is nothing new. Our business is already delivering consistent increases in sales and profitability in the years leading up to the pandemic. This was followed by a dramatic acceleration in 2020 and this year's continued growth.
In the second quarter, Target's comparable sales increased 8.9% on top of a record 24.3% growth a year ago. As a result, second quarter total sales have expanded more than 36% or more than $6.6 billion over the last 2 years.
On the bottom line, we earned second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.64, up nearly 8% compared with last year and double our performance 2 years ago.
As we described last quarter, guests have emerged from a year in which digital was the primary growth driver, and they're now returning to our stores in droves. As a result, the majority of our second quarter growth was driven by the stores channel, where comps grew 8.7% on top of 10.9% a year ago. In addition, traffic accounted for more than 100% of our second quarter growth, in contrast to a year ago when guests were limiting time out of their homes and the bulk of our growth was coming from bigger transactions.
Comparable digital sales grew 10% in the second quarter, building on the record growth of 195% last year. The digital channel continues to be led by our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 55% this year on top of more than 270% last year. Given their rapid expansion, same-day services now account for well over half of our digital sales. 
Among those same-day options, Drive Up has quickly grown to be the largest, accounting for more sales than pickup and Shipt combined. To put it in dollar terms, over the last 2 years, second quarter sales through Drive Up alone have increased by nearly $1.4 billion. And for the spring season, they've expanded by double that amount. 
Beyond our fulfillment options, we continue to benefit from our unique multi-category assortment, which is perfectly positioned to serve our guests' evolving wants and needs. As a result, comp sales in all 5 of our core categories expanded in the second quarter on top of strong growth a year ago. As expected, apparel continued to lead the way as our guests continue to respond to newness and style across both our owned and national brands throughout the assortment. 
Also as expected, we saw more moderate growth in our Hardlines and home categories this year as they expanded on top of really strong comparisons from a year ago. And notably, we continue to benefit from impressive performance across our less discretionary Food & Beverage and essential categories. These categories have again consistently delivered strong growth and market share gains, both in 2020 and again this year. I'll let Christina provide more details in a few minutes.
When we talk with many of you about what's driving Target performance, we often hear the question, ""What's the one thing that's been the key?"" The honest answer to that question, we can't point to any one thing. Rather, it's been everything working together that's driven our performance. This includes our supply chain work, which has positioned our stores as fulfillment hubs, while transforming the way we replenish store inventory. Then there's our rollout of same-day services, which began more than 5 years ago with in-store pickup, followed by the nationwide rollout of Drive Up and Shipt beginning in 2018. 
And there's the refreshment of our own brands, which began in 2016 with the rollout of Cat & Jack, followed by dozens of new owned brands over the last 5 years. At the same time, we've expanded our partnerships with premium national brands, including Disney, Levi's and Apple and, most recently, this month's opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop in shops. Across our store portfolio, we began testing small formats in 2014. And we now have more than 140 of these productive neighborhood locations across the country.
We've also remodeled more than half the chain over the last 4 years, transforming the shopping environment while optimizing the layout in support of our same-day services. And we've reinvented our store operating model, focusing on enhanced service and subject matter expertise in key categories while investing in visual merchandising across our network.
Then there's Target Circle, which launched in 2019 and now has more than 100 million members, providing a new connection with our guests while offering meaningful rewards.
And of course, we made multiple investments in our team, including the attainment of our goal to bring Target's nationwide starting wage up to $15 or more. This was certainly an important milestone, but far from the end of the journey. Just a few weeks ago, we announced an investment of more than $75 million to provide $200 recognition bonuses to all of our frontline, hourly, full-time and part-time team members across our stores, distribution centers and contact centers. 
I've said it many times before, but I can't say it enough. Our team is the lifeblood of Target. And our success begins and ends with them. I want to thank each of them and every one of them across the world for everything they do to make Target such a special place to shop and a great place to work and build a rewarding career. And today, given the profitable growth that comes from all of these efforts, we can continue to invest in making our business even stronger and more durable over time. 
In June, we were incredibly excited to launch Target Forward, an ambitious new sustainability strategy grounded in the vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future with our guests, partners and communities. Target Forward is centered around 3 critical ambitions: to design and elevate sustainable brands, innovate to eliminate waste and accelerate opportunity and equity. This bold initiative is the beginning of the new chapter for how we'll define sustainability, position our business for long-term growth and resiliency and build on our rich legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices.
As part of these efforts, in early August we announced that this fall, Target will be rolling out an industry-leading program to provide debt-free educational assistance for all of our U.S.-based full-time and part-time team members. This program will provide access to more than 250 business-aligned programs at more than 40 educational institutions, including historical black colleges and universities, along with institutions serving the Hispanic community. In total, we plan to spend $200 million to offer this benefit over the next 4 years, serving as a meaningful example of how we're investing to promote opportunity and equity in our communities, beginning with our own team. 
So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to acknowledge the likelihood that the second half of the year will continue to be volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant. Of course, safety remains our #1 priority, as evident in the way we operate our stores and our ongoing investments to encourage vaccinations by making them easy and accessible for both our team and our guests.
In terms of our business, the last 18 months have proven, beyond a doubt, the flexibility and resilience of both our team and our business model. And while sales in stores have been soaring so far this year, our operations and team have demonstrated how they can pivot seamlessly between stores and digital commerce based on how our guests choose to shop. I also want to emphasize that as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we see many more productive opportunities to invest in continued growth. 
And I also want to acknowledge the continued high level of execution we've been seeing across all of our teams. As John will outline in more detail, despite unusually high volatility for well over a year now, the Target team has been consistently setting the industry standard in terms of execution despite multiple challenges in the external environment. 
Our team continues to embrace every challenge as one aligned Target team, taking care of each other as they focus on serving our guests. I am truly inspired by their work and grateful to share the outstanding performance they're delivering quarter after quarter, year after year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina."

Our guests is at the forefront of every decision we make. By listening intently to them, anticipating their wants and needs and building our strategy around them, we can drive deeper engagement, trust and a stronger preference for Target over time. 
We built our same-day capabilities with that guest-first focus. And as we've shared before, when guests try services like Drive Up or Shipt for the first time, their overall spending increases, including an increase in conventional store shopping. In other words, digital engagement drives more engagement in our stores, providing us with more and more opportunities to surprise, delight and inspire them. This is one example of many showing how growth today creates a platform for additional growth in the future.
And of course, we wouldn't be where we are today without the best team in retail. So I want to take a moment and thank our entire team for delivering superior performance in a continued volatile environment even as they face ongoing challenges presented by the Delta variant, product cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and more.
Target's second quarter performance also demonstrates the strength and durability of our business model. Our unique, multi-category assortment offers the right balance of what our guests want and need even as they change, sometimes rapidly. As a result, despite record-setting growth last year, all 5 of our core merchandising categories grew again this year, proving that there's still plenty of runway ahead.
Second quarter results were strongest in apparel, which delivered mid-teens growth on top of low double-digit growth last year. Within apparel, swim, kids and young contemporary all delivered comps in the low 20% range. 
Food & Beverage delivered low double-digit growth in the second quarter. Performance was led by our bakery, cafe and deli businesses, which grew more than 50% as these departments were closed during part of the second quarter last year. We also saw double-digit growth in our fresh categories, benefiting from an expansion in the number of items available for Drive Up. In fact, nearly half of this year's growth in our produce business has been driven by the growth in Drive Up orders.
The Essentials & Beauty category delivered high single-digit growth this quarter. Within essentials, baby care grew by more than 20%, and we saw mid to high teens growth in both pets and health care. Beauty continued to gain market share on comp growth in the high single-digit range in advance of this month's rollout of our in-store partnership with Ulta Beauty.
Hardlines delivered mid-single-digit growth this quarter on top of more than 40% growth a year ago. We continue to benefit from strong momentum in toys, which grew in the low 20% range. Sporting goods was also a standout with growth in the high teens. As expected, electronics experienced a moderate comp decline in the mid-single-digit range as it comped over last year's growth of more than 70% during a period when some competitors were closed. Importantly, over the last 2 years, both Hardlines and electronics have delivered strong growth and market share gains. 
And finally, in home, following comp growth of more than 30% last year, we saw a low single-digit increase in the second quarter. Within home, we've seen moderating trends in categories like kitchen, storage and decor as they comped over outsized growth last year. At the same time, given our guests' increasing focus on gathering and celebrating holidays and family milestones, we've seen an acceleration in our seasonal and stationary categories, providing another example of the power of our broad, multi-category model.
And beyond individual categories, our diverse collection of owned brands continues to grow and provide differentiation across our assortment. In the second quarter, owned brand sales outpaced the company with growth in the mid-teens. And in Food & Beverage, where we're seeing tremendous growth in Good & Gather and encouraging results in our new brand, Favorite Day, we saw an increase in owned brand penetration of about 70 basis points compared with last year.
As we look ahead, despite uncertainties around the Delta variant and rising COVID cases, consumers have healthy balance sheets and remain eager to find safe ways to connect with their loved ones and find some sense of normalcy. We'll continue to safely meet their needs and add some much needed joy. 
First on that list is this month's launch of Ulta Beauty at Target, the next chapter in Target's already strong beauty story. The shared values and cultures between our businesses and our collective desire to inspire and elevate the shopping experience make this long-term partnership a major win for both companies and our guests. And like our guests, we're incredibly excited to see this new concept come to life following months of anticipation.
But our guests aren't just excited for their glow up to their beauty game, they're also looking for affordable options to refresh their wardrobe as they cautiously plan for more in-person interactions this fall. So it's perfect timing that this September, Target is partnering with 4 dynamic and highly regarded designers, Nili Lotan, Rachel Comey, Sandy Liang and Victor Glemaud, to create a limited time, size-inclusive apparel collection of modern and classic wardrobe staples.
And our partnerships go well beyond apparel and beauty. In home, we've enlisted the talent of Justina Blakeney, Jungalow founder and long-time partner, to bring Junglalow's cozy, wild and free vibe into our Opalhouse line, making it the perfect addition to our eclectic owned brand.
And for our littler guests, our newest design partnership is sure to inspire their imagination and help them to create some great new looks. Christian Robinson for Target, a full-of-wonder creation of the beloved artist, illustrator and children's book author, is a limited edition collection that includes home goods, apparel and books for kids and baby. And last, not least, for the furrier family members in your household, we have just launched Kindfull, our new pet food-owned brand focusing on healthy, sustainable and affordable food options for our beloved 4-legged friends.
Beyond partnerships and product launches, our guests are telling us they're hungry to celebrate key holidays, life moments and everyday occasions with their loved ones, having missed out on so many of them over the last 18 months. So even as they're mindful of the ongoing risks, our guests are carefully balancing caution with optimism and focusing on finding safe and affordable ways to celebrate. 
Already in progress, the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons are off to a great start. Regardless of whether back-to-school will be in-person or hybrid, Target has everything they need to be successful in any learning environment.
Similarly, as college freshmen look to move on to campus for the first time, our merchandising and inventory plans account for the fact that many sophomores find themselves in that same position, having attended their first year of college in a completely virtual environment.
Given the stresses that come with the start of school, Target is focused on making things as easy as possible for families with School List Assist. This feature, online and in the Target app, allows users to easily find their school-specific supply list and either shop by item or add the whole list with a click of a button. 
And like we did for holiday last year, our back-to-school offers will be spread throughout the entire season, providing both value and a safe shopping experience for our guests. This reflects our ongoing focus on providing value that goes far beyond price. It's about affordability and accessibility all season long.
And on that topic of providing value, we're rolling out new functionality in the Target app based on hearing from our guests that the fear of missing out on a deal is real, something affectionately known as promo FOMO. With this update, when guests add items to their cart, the app will automatically show them all the applicable Target Circle offers before checking out, reassuring them that they won't miss out on a great deal.
Looking ahead, we'll soon be trading in shorts and t-shirts for cozy sweaters and denim as we usher in the fall. And for Halloween, no matter how you plan to celebrate, Target has a few tricks and no shortage of treats up our sleeves. We'll continue to focus on value and inspiration with affordable and exciting costumes, including a broader-than-ever array of adaptive, size-inclusive and gender-neutral options. And of course, we'll have all the sweet treats for self-indulgence and sharing with others, including great new offerings from our Hyde & EEK! and Favorite Day owned brands.
Beyond our near-term plans, what energizes me the most is our focus on creating a more equitable, sustainable and inclusive world. This is why I'm so proud of our recently announced sustainability strategy, Target Forward, which is a comprehensive vision that touches every aspect of our business in support of people and planet. 
You've heard me talk about my role on Target's REACH Committee, which was formed with a goal of achieving lasting, systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities, serving as a perfect extension of the broader Target Forward strategy. The recruitment and retention of more diverse team members, more products from diverse suppliers, a new direction for our philanthropic efforts in communities of color and more equity for all, these are unwavering commitments in support of our goals. 
While there's much more to accomplish, I'm pleased with the progress we've already made. One example is our commitment to increase black representation across our company by 20% by the year 2023. To date, we've seen progress at all salaried levels, most notably in a nearly 25% increase among our company officers. 
So while it's incredibly rewarding to see how well our business is performing, I'm most proud of our commitment to invest in the long-term health of our team, our communities and the planet, our company purpose, focus on sustainability and then creating a more equitable and inclusive world. These are not a collection of separate initiatives tacked onto our core business. Rather, they are the bedrock of who we are and how we make decisions. While their benefit may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, I strongly believe that they're the foundation of how we'll grow our business, sustain our communities and move forward together over time.
With that, I will turn the call over to John."

Instead, we're investing to enhance the productivity of our team members, freeing them up to focus on what's most important, like serving our guests.
This is another example of the power of and how it runs through every part of our business. The choice doesn't have to be about people or technology. We can invest in both people and their productivity. 
Here's one way to think about it. In our 2015 annual report, we reported that Target had around 341,000 team members as we entered 2016, a year in which our business generated just over $69 billion in sales. 5 years later, our 2020 annual report showed that we had about 409,000 team members going into this year, representing about 20% growth in the number of team members over that 5-year period. 
However, based on our results so far and our expectations for the back half of the year, our business is positioned to deliver more than $100 billion in sales this year, representing growth of 45% or more compared with 5 years ago. So even as we've added nearly 70,000 people to our team, we've also benefited from a significant increase in their productivity, creating financial capacity to provide enhanced service for our guests and make significant investments in pay and benefits. 
And as Brian mentioned, our team has been performing at an incredibly high level, raising the bar on historically strong execution. Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw an improvement in already high Net Promoter Scores for all 3 of our same-day services, most notably for the in-store pickup experience. In addition, Drive Up, which remains our highest-rated service, saw an increase in guest satisfaction compared with last year, on top of last year's improvements over 2019.
And we continue to find ways to enhance our industry-leading pickup and Drive Up capabilities. In the second quarter, we added another 5,000 items to the assortment available for pickup and Drive Up, ranging from items in adult beverages to fresh pet food, meal kits and greeting cards. We also continue to roll out technology enhancements, including functionality to provide backup suggestions when an item is unavailable, a chain-wide rollout of numbered parking spaces for guests using Drive Up and the ability in the app to seamlessly designate an alternate person to pick up an order.
Beyond same-day capabilities, we also saw a meaningful increase in satisfaction with our in-store shopping experience, driven by improvements across multiple attributes, most notably around team member interactions, both on the sales floor and at checkout. These increases reflect the impact of our new service initiatives, which focus on serving our guests on their own terms, while authentically bringing our company purpose to life through the guest experience.
This spring, more than 300,000 team members completed training on these initiatives, offering them tools to provide a consistent, differentiated shopping experience regardless of how our guests choose to shop. Higher guest satisfaction scores provide clear evidence that our team has enthusiastically embraced this training as they build their confidence and expertise in establishing authentic connections with our guests.
As Christina mentioned, our teams at headquarters have also done a great job as they navigate multiple challenges across the supply chain. And while we're happy that in-stocks have improved meaningfully compared with a year ago, we have more work to do as our guests are still seeing empty shelves on some occasions. In some of those situations, we've simply sold beyond our expectations, and our team is working quickly to secure additional quantities. In other cases, the vendors themselves are facing constraints in their ability to deliver product. And we're collaborating with them to address these constraints together, securing as much product as possible on behalf of our guests.
And our team has been successfully addressing supply chain bottlenecks, which are affecting both domestic freight and international shipping. Steps include expedited ordering and larger upfront quantities in advance of a season, mitigating the risk that replenishment could take longer than usual. Bottom line, with Q2 ending inventory up more than 26% or nearly $2.5 billion compared with a year ago, we believe we're well positioned for the fall and ready to deliver strong growth on top of last year's record increases.
In everyday life, when you see an artist, performer or athlete who's at the top of their craft, they typically make their work look simple. The mastery they've achieved makes it easy to look past all the effort and passion behind their high level of performance. That's true in business as well. When you see a successful company generating impressive growth on both the top line and the bottom line, it's easy to miss the passion and hard work of the team that's delivering that performance. So as always, I want to pause and thank our team members everywhere in the world for everything they do to propel our business forward regardless of the challenges that come their way.
Our properties team has had a busy year as they ramp up our remodel program following last year's temporary suspension. In addition, they're working to open new neighborhood stores, distribution centers and sortation centers across the country. More than 100 remodel projects are currently in flight, and we're on track to complete about 140 remodels in 2021 and an even higher number in 2022. 
The team has also opened 19 new stores this year, spanning from 3 more stores in New York City to all the way across the country in Hollywood. We're on track to open 12 more stores this fall, including a new location in Orlando adjacent to Disney World, a new site in Hawaii and a campus location in Madison, Wisconsin, welcome news to all my fellow Badgers out there.
We opened 2 new distribution facilities in the second quarter: 1 in New Jersey and another near Chicago, creating additional replenishment capacity within our network. We're planning to add more capacity in 2022, given the sales growth we've already sustained over the last 1.5 years and the continued growth we expect to generate going forward.
And to support our ship-from-store capability, the team is getting ready to open 2 new sortation centers in October, followed by 2 more after the holidays. These new facilities offer faster delivery times at a lower cost in markets with a high density of shipments. In addition, they free up backroom space at store locations they serve, expanding capacity for more digital growth over time.
And finally, in support of our commitment to being a net 0 enterprise by 2040, the team is driving towards 0 waste to landfill in our U.S. operations and improving overall energy efficiency as we transition to renewable energy. This includes investing in contracts for off-site renewable energy and additional rooftop solar projects as we move beyond our 2020 goal of having rooftop solar at 500 facilities.
So it's clear we have many opportunities to invest capital productively across both our stores and the broader supply chain. But I want to end my remarks where I started: with our team. I've been at Target for 25 years now, and one of the many reasons I've stayed here is the way we've always invested in our team, creating a uniquely strong culture and a high level of engagement. 
But in recent years, we've doubled down on what was already a strength. Obviously, this includes our investments in pay, including our starting wage, but it goes much further. We've also made investments in benefits and recently announced that several programs we added during the pandemic have now become ongoing benefits for all U.S.-based team members, including free access to health care through virtual doctor visits and free online resources and apps to support mental, emotional and physical health.
And as Brian mentioned, in support of Target Forward's ambitions to advance opportunity and equity and create an equitable and inclusive workforce, we are really proud and excited to announce our new debt-free education assistance program earlier this month. We have the most comprehensive program in the industry, offering more than 340,000 team members debt-free access to undergraduate degrees, certificates, certifications and more, beginning with their first day at Target. Importantly, the program pays for smaller out-of-pocket costs, such as textbooks and course fees that might otherwise hinder participation. And for those who want to continue beyond their undergraduate education, the program will pay up to $10,000 annually for team members pursuing a master's degree. 
As Brian has said many times, of all the investments we've made over the last 5 years, none have been more impactful than the ones we've made in our team. And like any investment that's generating a high return, we continue to look for opportunities to do more, deepening our team's connection with Target, while they deepen Target's relationship with our guests.
Because of the investments we've made over time, store team member turnover remains low at a time when the labor market has been heating up to levels we haven't seen in a very long time. That's one of the many reasons I'm grateful to serve alongside this great team, and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael."

After a record year in 2020, the theme of this year's performance has been growth on top of growth. Of course, we laid the groundwork for this year's growth through the investment decisions we were making years ago in our stores, owned brands, supply chain, technology and our team. And today, we continue to see a host of opportunities to invest in our future. That certainly includes the capital we're investing in support of our stores and supply chain and the investments we're making in our team, including recently announced team member bonuses and our new debt-free education assistance program. And while the return on team member investments isn't measured as a distinct line in our financial statements, they're the most important investments we make. 
Total sales grew 9.4% in the second quarter, driven by comp growth of 8.9%. Within the quarter, May saw the smallest increase this year, given that it was comping over a 33% increase a year ago. On a 2-year basis, results were much more consistent throughout the quarter, as we saw 2-year growth in excess of 30% across all 3 months. 
As Brian mentioned, with guests spending more time out of their homes, we've seen them shopping more often and making slightly smaller trips. Specifically, traffic grew 12.7% in the second quarter, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in average ticket. However, given that last year's comp growth was primarily driven by average ticket, on a 2-year basis, we've seen double-digit increases in both traffic and ticket since 2019.
As Brian also mentioned, the store channel has been our primary growth driver this year. Specifically, store comparable sales grew 8.7% in the second quarter. And given that store comps increased 10.9% last year, we've seen compounded growth of our in-store sales of more than 20% over the last 2 years.
In the digital channel, comp sales grew 10% on top of 195% a year ago. And reflecting this year's change in guests' shopping habits, the mix of our digital fulfillment changed meaningfully. Specifically, same-day services grew 55% in the quarter, while sales on orders shipped to home actually declined from last year's elevated levels. This provides vivid evidence of the stickiness of our same-day services. Once guests try them, they love them. So even as they've ramped up their in-store shopping, they've continued to rely on these services as well.
Another indication of this year's shift in guest behavior, the percent of total sales from the digital channel actually fell slightly compared with last year, moving from 17.2% in second quarter 2020 back to 17% this year. Obviously, this isn't a trend we expect will continue over time, and it's important to note that this year's digital penetration of 17% is well over double the 7.3% we reported in second quarter 2019. 
Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was down about 50 basis points from 30.9% a year ago. Among the drivers, last year's change in the sales return reserve estimate, which contributed about $110 million to second quarter gross margin last year, accounted for about 50 basis points of rate pressure this year. In other words, without last year's benefit from this change in the reserve estimate, our second quarter gross margin rate would have been about flat compared to last year. 
Among other gross margin drivers, we saw about 70 basis points of pressure in merchandising, reflecting the impact of higher product and freight costs, partially offset by the benefit of low markdown rates. This pressure was offset by about 40 basis points of tailwind for merchandise mix, combined with a small benefit from supply chain and digital fulfillment, driven by the shift in digital mix toward our less costly same-day options. 
On the SG&A expense line, we saw a rate of 19.3% this year, down about 10 basis points from last year. This change reflected the continued leverage benefit from strong sales growth, offset by pressure from an increase in some expense rates in areas like marketing from lower-than-normal levels a year ago. This year's SG&A expenses also reflect continued growth in pay and benefits for our team. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from last year, driven by leverage on our sales growth. 
Altogether, second quarter operating margin rate was 9.8%, down about 20 basis points from a year ago, but more than 2.5 percentage points higher than second quarter 2019. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP EPS of $3.65 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $3.64 was 7.9% above last year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS have both doubled over the last 2 years.
So far this year, our operations have generated just over $3.4 billion of cash. This is historically strong performance, but about $1.7 billion lower than a year ago due to some unique circumstances affecting last year. Specifically, our inventory position at the end of the second quarter last year was much lower than we'd have preferred given that our sales had far outpaced our expectations during the first half of the year. As a result, at this point last year, inventory turnover and payables leverage were running unusually high and would have been lower had we owned the appropriate amount of inventory to support our sales. 
As such, this year, our inventory is in a much better position, more than $2 billion higher than last year. And our payables leverage has begun to decline to a more sustainable level, both of which are near-term headwinds to operating cash flow. In addition, our year-to-date income tax payments are more than $1 billion higher than at this time last year, given the volatility in our taxable income through the first half of last year.
As I turn to capital deployment, I want to start where I always do, which is to reiterate our priorities, which have remained the same for decades. First, we invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual dividend increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we return any excess cash over time through share repurchases within the limits of our strong middle A credit ratings.
So far this year, we've invested just over $1.3 billion in CapEx to support the new store, remodel and supply chain projects that John outlined earlier. And for the year, we're now expecting CapEx in the $3.5 billion range. This is about $0.5 billion lower than our original expectation and reflects the retiming of some project spending into next year. As a result of this retiming, our view of next year's CapEx is somewhat higher than our prior view, in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. And we'll continue to refine our view as we move into next year. Bottom line, we're excited about the productive opportunities in front of us and we'll govern our investment decisions with a focus on delivering continued growth and superior returns. 
Beyond our capital investments, we paid dividends of $336 million in the second quarter, and we returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases at an average price of just over $230. And as we announced today, our Board has approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which will allow us to continue buying back shares once the current $5 billion program is completed. This authorization is consistent with the capital deployment priorities I outlined above. It also reflects our confidence in the ongoing strength of our business and the robust cash flow we expect to generate over time. 
Even after this year's investments in our business and team and the return of capital to our shareholders, we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $7.4 billion. This is up slightly from a year ago and well above the cash position we expect to maintain over time. But as I've said before, given our current cash position and elevated volatility in the current environment, we believe it will be a multiyear journey before our exceptionally strong cash and credit metrics move fully back to long-term levels consistent with our single A credit ratings. 
Before I turn to our expectations, I want to close my review of our current performance with a brief discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the performance of our investment decisions over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of the second quarter, Target's after-tax ROIC was 31.7% compared with 17.2% a year ago. This is an amazing number and a testament to the performance of our business model and our team over the last year. As we've said before, we expect this metric could settle back into the mid to high 20s over time, but to deliver a sustainable after-tax return in that range is a remarkable performance in any industry. And these superior returns are one of the many reasons we're eager to continue investing in the growth and resilience of our business to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
Now let's turn to our comp sales expectations for the fall season. As you'll recall, in our conference call 90 days ago, we described how our business was positioned to deliver single-digit comp growth in the back half of the year, on top of very strong growth of more than 20% in the back half of 2020. While the environment remains volatile today, and there are many uncertainties as we look ahead, Target's performance through the first half of the year has consistently exceeded our expectations. This performance, combined with the continued strength in the U.S. consumer, gives us increasing confidence that this fall, our business can generate comparable sales growth in the high single-digit range, near the high end of our previous guidance range.
We have a similar outlook regarding profitability. 90 days ago, we said we expected our full year operating margin rate would be well above the 2020 rate of 7%, with a potential for it to reach 8% or somewhat higher. From today's perspective, based on our expectation of high single-digit comp growth in the fall, we expect to see an operating margin rate near the high end of our previous range. Specifically, we now believe that Target is positioned to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher for the full year. 
I've been at Target for more than 17 years now, and I've never experienced a time like this when every aspect of our diverse strategy is coming together like we're seeing today. Obviously, our guests are noticing, too, based on their higher level of engagement, which you can see in our outstanding performance.
Typically, in retail, if you saw a large, mature company like ours growing at the rate we're seeing today, you'd assume we were comping over soft numbers from the prior year. Instead, we're comping over a year of record growth in 2020 on both the top and bottom lines. 
Like Brian said earlier, our success begins and ends with the team. So on behalf of all of our stakeholders, I'd like to close my remarks today by thanking the entire Target team for the exceptional results we're reporting today. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian."

Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on Michael's last point, which is the way we've been able to synchronize every aspect of our strategy. A few years ago, we embarked on a project to better articulate our company purpose. Across our team, there was already a strong sense of who we are and what we stand for, but we wanted to put it into words distinctly.
Out of that work came the purpose we articulate today: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Those words have deep meaning for our team: families, discovery, joy and the word all, which represents our strong commitment to inclusion across every aspect of our business.
Some might ask if everyone at Target already had a strong sense of purpose, why go to the trouble of putting it into words? The answer is the alignment that it creates, alignment of our strategy and alignment of our team. In the same way we had a focus on what really matters most in our articulation of our purpose, we're relying on that purpose to focus both our strategic work and our everyday activities. 
If we find ourselves working on something that doesn't advance our purpose, we can set it aside and relentlessly focus on the things that will move Target forward. That kind of focus has enabled the performance we're reporting today, and it's behind all of our investments, strategies and activities as we look ahead. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions."

I actually think that same theme comes through loud and clear if we zoom out a little bit and look at a longer time period. If you go back to first half of this year versus first half of 2019, 2019 gross margin rate was 30.1% for the Q1 and Q2 season. We're sitting at 30.4% right now in Q2 and 30.2% for the spring. And so a lot's happened over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about our ability to manage the profitability of the business.

The aggregate has been consistent and healthy. 
But there are behavior changes within businesses. We've talked about the fact that last year, there was a bigger need for household essentials and people were stocking up. Now we're seeing less of that, and we're seeing more the return to going out. And therefore, they're wearing dresses and beauty products, and luggage business has been very strong.

I think the second thing, and probably more importantly, is the continued growth in our same-day services, tremendous growth in Shipt, in Order Pickup and Drive Up. And the growth in Drive Up is truly remarkable, but the one I like to look at is Order Pickup. We started that 6 years ago, and it continues to grow meaningfully quarter after quarter, year after year after year. So all 3 of those are acting incrementally each year and not taking business away from each other. 
And as you know, the thing we love about that, it's great service for our guests. They're our highest-rated services. Drive Up is the single highest-rated service we have. But also for us, it's fast and very, very efficient. And we love the margin that comes along with those products.

On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. 
In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. 
And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties. The most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian?"

Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now. And they continue to demonstrate the extraordinary level of engagement we're seeing from our g",1227,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 
Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now. And they continue to demonstrate the extraordinary level of engagement we're seeing from our guests, both with our brand and with our team. 
In the third quarter, comparable sales expanded 12.7%, on top of a nearly 21% increase one year ago. Consistent with recent quarters, traffic was the primary driver of this year's growth as our guests increasingly turn to Target to serve their wants and needs. Across our sales channels, store sales were the primary growth driver this quarter, while same-day services propelled our digital growth. Since the third quarter of 2019, prior to the pandemic, Q3 store sales have expanded by $3.8 billion, while digital sales have increased another $3.1 billion. This provides a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of our operating model to serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. All of these results reflect the level of guest engagement far beyond what many would have imagined a few years ago, when we started making huge investments throughout our business, in our stores, new brands, same-day services, supply chain, and importantly, our team. Back then, Target was already known for a world-class team, a differentiated shopping experience, unique assortment and an iconic brand. But we knew there was much more to do. We saw a clear opportunity to build on that solid foundation, finding new ways to enhance our capabilities, while strengthening the bond with both our team and our guests. And today, those bonds have never been stronger. 
As I mentioned, within our digital capabilities, more and more of our guests are trying and embracing our industry-leading same-day services. Third quarter sales through these services have expanded by nearly 400% or $2 billion over the last 2 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, sales through these services have grown by more than $6 billion since 2019, a number larger than the total sales of many prominent retailers. 
Beyond fulfillment capabilities, our balanced multi-category assortment is another key driver of flexibility and resiliency within our business model. The breadth of our assortment, both within and across our core categories, allows our team to quickly and seamlessly serve our guests, even when their wants and needs are changing rapidly. In the third quarter, we saw consistent strong growth across our entire merchandising portfolio. More specifically, all 5 of our core merchandise categories saw a double-digit growth in the quarter, ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-teens, resulting in strong market share gains on top of unprecedented share growth in 2020. 
And we're not slowing down in our efforts to serve our guests. We continue to invest in key partnerships that enhance our assortment and experience, including the opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops and our recent announcement that we're doubling the number of enhanced Apple experiences in electronics. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In our conference call 3 months ago, we outlined multiple actions we're taking to support our inventory and in-stocks, given the supply chain challenges that have emerged throughout the pandemic. As you know, those pressures only intensified in the third quarter. And our team has done an outstanding job in the face of these challenges, identifying bottlenecks and finding solutions to keep inventory flowing throughout our network. Although efforts drove some incremental costs in the quarter, we view them as a continuation of the many productive long-term investments we're making in our business in support of the trust we have built with our guests. And obviously, our guests responded to these efforts with strong third quarter traffic, which we expect will continue in Q4 and beyond. 
Beyond our supply chain, the team has done a great job navigating through broader cost pressures as many vendors have raised wholesale prices to accommodate higher costs within their businesses. As our team faced these cost increases, they maintained a guest-first approach and a focus on value while managing overall profitability as well. As a result, our business delivered strong third quarter financial results, from the top to the bottom of the P&L, while building on the trust we've established with our guests. 
So I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of our teams across the company, from headquarters to stores, from our merchandising, distribution and transportation teams to our sourcing offices around the world. Because of your agility, energy and selfless collaboration, Target delivered for our guests and our shareholders in the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter and ramp up for the peak holiday season, we're really well positioned to continue delivering for all of our stakeholders and close out an already amazing year. I want to thank you for everything you do. 
So the theme you'll hear in today's call is that we're excited and ready for the holiday season. We know our guests are excited to celebrate, following a year in 2020 when many families stayed apart due to safety concerns. This year, our guests have eagerly started their holiday shopping, as they respond to our holiday promotions, low price guarantees and our ongoing efforts to provide ease, reliability, safety and value across every shopping experience. 
And importantly, we have taken multiple actions to support our guests during the holiday season and beyond. On top of the investments in inventory, in-stocks and value I outlined earlier, we've announced that we're hiring 30,000 new year-round supply chain team members to support our current and expected growth. In our stores, we're providing our team members with more pay, flexibility and reliable hours this holiday season, offering more than 5 million additional hours to our existing team, and investment of more than $75 million over the holiday season. To supplement the additional hours from our existing team, we're hiring another 100,000 seasonal team members throughout the country. Many of whom will have an opportunity to stay on with Target after the holidays. 
And importantly, during a season in which our guests are busier than any other time of the year, our merchandising and marketing teams are focused on cutting through the clutter. That means we're keeping our marketing messages and promotions simple and our operations flexible to offer an easy and reliable experience for our guests no matter how they choose to shop. 
And finally, while Target has already had an outstanding year, our team is looking ahead and not slowing down. We're continuing to invest in our future, in our new stores and existing stores, our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, in our owned and national brands, and the safety and well-being of our team. We're investing in Target Forward, an ambitious commitment to co-create an equitable and regenerative future, together with our guests, partners and communities. All of these efforts are focused on advancing Target's leadership position within retail, taking a guest-led approach to everything we do and supporting our company values to care, grow and win together. 
I had the privilege of working alongside this great team as they bring our values to life every day across every part of the company. I'm endlessly grateful for their passion and support of our guests, of our brand and for each other. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina."

Our third quarter results demonstrate what happens when our team lives out our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. When we lead with our guests first, we continue to build upon the trust that we have carefully earned with them over time. And when our strategies are guests led, we grow our business, which supports our team, our financial performance and our ability to give back to our communities and the planet. 
As you heard from Brian, third quarter comparable sales grew 12.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in every one of our core merchandising categories. Even within those core categories, sales strength was broad-based, and virtually every area of the business grew over last year. This shows the power of our multi-category assortment in driving guest relevance and affinity for Target. 
While growth came from all categories, third quarter performance was led by our Essentials, Beauty and Food and Beverage categories. All of which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens. These businesses continue to deliver substantial share gains on top of last year's gains through both trip frequency and basket growth. 
In Essentials, growth was led by Baby Care, pets and over-the-counter health care categories. Strength in food and beverage was most notable in our fresh and frozen categories as well as in snacks and candy. 
Hardlines, which comped in the mid-teens on top of mid-30% comps last year, was fueled by incredible momentum in our toys and sporting goods businesses, which both saw comp growth north of 20%. Electronics delivered low single-digit comp growth on top of last year's comp of nearly 60%. 
In our apparel business, comp sales grew in the low double-digits despite unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. Performance was strongest in swim, young contemporary, intimates and hosiery. In home, low double-digit comp growth was led by seasonal and stationary categories, and reflected record-setting performance in the back-to-school, back-to-college and Halloween seasons. 
We have seen consistently strong results across seasonal categories, results that clearly signaled that our guests are excited to celebrate the holidays with loved ones in new, old and reimagined ways. However they celebrate, our guests remain focused on meeting their wants and needs with ease, convenience and value. And as the holidays approach, they are turning to Target for these solutions. This is about more than just checking items off the list. Beyond working through the logistics of the holiday, our guests are looking to us to provide joy, and a joyous holiday is exactly what we plan to deliver. 
We continuously evaluate our guest mindset, which serves as a north star for all our strategies and decisions. We remain laser-focused on their experiences with us and expectations of us. And we strive to build flexibility and agility into our plans to ensure we show up at our best for them during the holidays and all year round. We are confident in our ability to navigate the broader retail landscape. And we're eager to share all that we've planned for the upcoming holidays. Whether our guests are rekindling old holiday traditions or finding new ways to celebrate the season, we're focused on making Target the destination that makes it easy, safe, inspiring and affordable to celebrate what matters most: the magic of spending time with those we love. 
As John will outline in more detail, our teams are working diligently to get the right inventory to the right place at the right time. Doing so has driven some near-term gross margin pressure and appropriate long-term investment in the relationship with our guests. Bottom line, based on the incredible efforts of our team, we feel good about our inventory levels heading into the holiday season. 
In addition to the investments in our inventory position, we remain committed to providing great value with every trip to Target. And that value goes far beyond delivering exceptional everyday pricing. It includes offering compelling holiday deals, great quality products and an array of options to support all budgets, including accessible payment options. 
Last year, we spread our promotions throughout the months of November and December to avoid crowding in stores, and we heard from our guests that they loved it. As a result, we're spreading savings throughout the season again this year to give guests flexibility to get the best deals on their terms whenever and however they choose to shop. We'll feature compelling offers throughout the season on top items, great weekly deals and surprise deals of the day, both in-store and online, as well as additional deals for Target Circle members. 
And to reinforce value throughout the season, we recently announced the launch of our Holiday Price Match Guarantee, our most robust price match ever. When guests see holiday best deal at Target, they can shop confidently, knowing they are getting Black Friday sized savings with our best planned price of the season. In essence, any time they see a deal at Target, our guests can be confident it's the right time to buy. 
We also know that our guests want flexibility, not just in what they want to buy and how they want to shop, but how to manage their budget as well. That's why with the help of 2 new partners, Sezzle and Affirm, we've added new payment solutions that allow our guests to buy what they need now, take advantage of our best deals and pay at a pace that works best for them. 
With a strong inventory position and a great value proposition, we're able to lean into our uniquely Target assortment to build upon our traditional offering great gifting ideas and easy gathering solutions, like even more creative Gingerbread house making kits, Bullseye's top toys and gift sets for any budget. Spanning beauty, apparel, food and beverage and more, these gifting options will bring together the best of only our Target owned brands with curated national brands. 
And for those seeking extra inspiration, our thoughtfully curated digital shopping lists will bring the joyful discovery our guests love, helping them find the perfect gift for anyone on their list, whether they are shopping our stores or on our site. 
In addition to gifting, guests are focused on gathering with friends and family. And we have everything they need to create memorable moments, whether it's preparing a delicious meal, throwing a festive family party or hosting a game night with friends, from good and gathered cheeseboard starter kits and favorite day baked-goods, to threshold fall collections, including festive baking dishes, serving platters in the color of the season, and an array of plates, linens and other table toppers, all $15 and under. 
We want to create joy for all of our guests this holiday season, and we are excited to do so with our most inclusive assortment to date. Throughout our digital and in-store shopping experience, our guests are sure to see themselves reflected in our culturally relevant gifting and gathering solutions. We'll highlight Black-owned businesses in beauty, Hardlines, Food and beverage and home, including McBride sisters wine pairings, buy pack authors in our $10 book assortment and a limited time black artist partnership in wrapping paper. And our guests will see themselves represented in inclusive gift card messaging and imagery, providing options that celebrate the many meaningful holidays of the season, including Kwanza and Hanukkah. 
We're also delivering joy beyond our holiday assortment by building on our incredible legacy of creating differentiated shop-in-shop experiences that drive traffic and inspire our guests. They continue to tell us how much they love our exciting and expanding partnerships, with brands like Disney, Ulta Beauty and Apple. With each partnership, we're adding excitement, convenience and newness for our guests, while unlocking incremental growth for each of the partners. So it's no surprise we're building on this momentum in time for the holiday season. We are tripling the number of Disney stores at Target locations and doubling our Apple shop-in-shop experiences. On top of that, of course, this will be our debut holiday season featuring Ulta Beauty at Target. 
And on the subject of Ulta Beauty at Target, our guests are telling us it's clearly hitting the bull's eye, with makeup, skincare, Bath & Body, hair care and fragrance from more than 50 top brands now available at Ulta Beauty at Target. Both in stores and online, there's plenty to love about this new partnership, and we are so excited for all that is yet to come. 
And we'll build on our tradition of joy making partnerships this December when we will launch an exclusive lifestyle collection of products with one of the most beloved toy brands ever, Lego. Think brick inspired hooded sweatshirts, colorful Lego shape tumblers and of course, iconic Lego brick and mini figure sets. This collection builds on our long-standing partnership with the Lego Group and reflects our shared values of inclusivity, optimism and joy. With nearly 300 must-haves for the family, pets and home, and most of the colorful brick inspired items under $30, our guests are sure to find something everyone will love on any budget. 
Joy, ease, value, inclusivity, the ingredients helping to deliver on our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, a recipe that we refine quarter after quarter by listening to our guests, learning from their choices and working across our talented team. And these plans wouldn't come to life without the many talents and contributions of our dedicated team. 
So with deep gratitude and humility, I want to thank our team for serving the communities, for showing up every day for our guests and each other, and for bringing Target's values to life. You inspire me with all that you do. And because of you, I know we will win this holiday season. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Every day, across the operations team, we focus on execution. On our supply chain team, the focus is on moving the right amount of inventory to the right place at the right time. In our stores, which fulfill more than 95% of our total sales, the team focuses on delivering a great guest experience across hundreds of millions of guest transactions every quarter. And on our properties team, the team focuses on optimizing our physical footprint, including the planning and construction of new stores and distribution facilities, along with our investments to maintain and enhance the productivity of our existing buildings. 
Of course, all of these aspects of operations matter all year long. But in the fourth quarter, when we handle the largest volumes of the year, everything moves faster, making the need for detailed planning and precise execution even greater. That's why, every year, we construct our plans with the fourth quarter in mind so we can remove distractions and roadblocks in advance of the holiday peak. That means on the properties team, we plan our remodeling new store projects so they're completed before the holidays. And our technology team rolls out new systems and tools on the same time line. In the supply chain and in our stores, we carefully plan the ramp-up of seasonal hiring and team member training in advance of the holidays so everyone is ready to handle the additional volume. That's what happens every year. 
But as Brian and Christina have already mentioned, this year, our teams have been facing additional out-of-the-ordinary challenges as they plan for and deliver record-setting volumes while facing unprecedented bottlenecks in the global supply chain. 
So while I'm lucky to work with our amazing team every day. It's at times like these that our team shines brightest. Beyond their skill and expertise, they face every challenge with good nature and a collaborative mindset. I can't describe how proud I am to represent everything they've accomplished this year, as they've delivered historically strong growth on top of record increases a year ago. 
Within our supply chain, the team has been methodically working around multiple obstacles and challenges throughout the network, prioritizing our holiday-sensitive categories within our import receipts, while thoughtfully planning domestic transportation to ensure products reach the shelf at the right time. 
And while we continue to see some periodic outages across different items and categories, we're entering the holidays with a very healthy inventory position overall. Specifically, at the end of the third quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was more than $2 billion higher than last year, representing growth of about 18% from a year ago. Looking back to the pre-COVID period, our Q3 ending inventory has grown more than $3.5 billion since the end of Q3 2019, representing 31% growth over a 2-year period. A sizable amount of this inventory will continue to flow to our stores over the next few weeks. And our team has clear visibility to where the inventory is located and when it will arrive in our stores. 
In our overseas operations, we've benefited from a significant reduction in delay times. And of course, given that we were already anticipating tight conditions many months ago, the team has been writing this year's holiday purchase orders much earlier than last year to proactively mitigate the risk of both known and unexpected delays. 
We're also benefiting from really strong performance across our domestic transportation network. And we've secured the necessary capacity across both rail and over-the-road trucking to accommodate anticipated shipments throughout the fourth quarter. 
At the intersection of our overseas and domestic supply chains, the team continues to work around significant port delays, diverting shipments to less congested entry points and relying on air freight in certain cases. And while Target's port operations have long been considered best-in-class, our team has been actively collaborating with government and port officials to help find solutions that will allow everyone's containers to move through the ports more quickly. And we're encouraged with the changes that have recently been put in place. 
I also want to pause and emphasize the ongoing collaboration that's been happening between our supply chain, merchandising and marketing teams. These teams have worked together to develop promotional and marketing plans that are much more fluid and nimble than in the past, enabling the incorporation of real-time data on inventory availability and location within our holiday plans in order to maximize their impact to the benefit of both our guests and operations. 
In our stores, the team has been preparing for fourth quarter all year. And they're energized and ready to serve our guests throughout the season. This will be the first holiday season since we launched our new service initiative, which is all about empowering our teams and increasing their confidence to build authentic connections with our guests. Also new this year, we've rolled out a new point-of-sale system across more than 90% of our stores, providing more speed, efficiency and enhanced experience at both the checkout and our service counter. 
To continue building on our industry-leading in-store pickup and drive-up experiences, we've been rolling out new capabilities all year. These efforts include capital projects to add permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, investing in flexible fixtures to provide temporary storage areas to support seasonal peak, adding thousands of new items to the list available for pickup and Drive-Up, doubling the number of drive-up parking stalls compared with last year, and designating stall numbers to help our teams deliver drive-up orders more efficiently. 
Even as we're adding these new capabilities, we're also supporting our long-standing commitment to providing a safe shopping experience, maintaining the enhanced COVID cleaning and safety routines that we implemented throughout the pandemic. We've also been investing in team member hours, processes and training to prepare our team to handle record freight and fulfillment volumes this year, all while enhancing safety messaging and actively monitoring processes to protect the safety of both our guests and our team. 
And of course, as Brian mentioned, our team is focused on being fully staffed across the store and supply chain throughout the holiday season. Our stores have been hitting their seasonal hiring milestones. And because of the advancements we've made in scheduling this year, average hours per store team member are running significantly higher this year in comparison to past years. 
In fact, unlike what you're hearing from many others, because of the investments we've made in pay and benefits and our focus on team member training and engagement, the hourly turnover rate in our stores is actually running lower this year compared with 2019, particularly for our newly hired team members. 
And we're continuing to invest in our team. Following the recent rollout of the most comprehensive debt-free education program in the industry, we announced that to sustain our momentum through the holidays, we're offering pay premiums during peak periods in our stores and distribution centers over the holiday season. As we've said many times, our investments in the team are the most productive ones we've made. 
Turning to the work of the properties team. We expect to finish about 145 remodels in 2021, having completed more than 40 remodels prior to the end of Q3, with more than 100 additional projects slated to wrap up before the holiday. The team also opened another 15 new stores in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to 30. Among those projects, we've opened new stores ranging from 11,000 to 160,000 square feet, which demonstrates the flexibility we've developed to design the optimal store size for an individual neighborhood, based on their local needs and available real estate in the market. 
To increase the capacity and efficiency of our supply chain, our team has also opened 2 new distribution centers this year. In addition, we have 2 new sortation centers set to open in the fourth quarter, with 2 more on track to open early next year. 
While our supply chain has had to address a host of unique challenges, I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of our construction team, which enabled them to successfully bring a huge number of store and distribution projects to completion this year. These are highly complex projects across multiple geographies, which require precise coordination across a large number of regional construction providers, along with a diverse group of fixture and equipment vendors. All of whom have been facing the same bottlenecks we've been facing in our merchandise supply chain. Our construction team has handled all of these challenges with good humor and resilience, allowing us to continue reaching guests in new neighborhoods and support the growing supply chain needs of the entire chain. 
In support of those growing needs, we recently announced that we're adding more than 30,000 permanent positions across our supply chain network to support the growth we expect to continue delivering in the fourth quarter and beyond. These team members will support new buildings in our regional DC network, adding replenishment capacity to support an increasingly productive store network. They'll also be staffing and supporting our new sortation centers, which deliver efficiency, speed and additional capacity in support of last-mile fulfillment. 
And it's amazing to pause and look back at how much our network needs have grown in a short time. For the entire fiscal year in 2018, our business generated $74 billion in sales. Less than 3 years later, our business had already delivered $74 billion in sales through the third quarter, with the biggest quarter of the year still ahead of us. Our team and supply chain infrastructure have done an outstanding job in supporting that growth. And given that we don't expect it to end anytime soon, we are committed to growing our physical footprint and our team so they can continue to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders in Q4 and beyond. 
When I first started working here in 1996, Target delivered just under $18 billion in revenue, for what was then called Dayton Hudson Corporation. 
While many things have changed since then, both in retail and at this company, we successfully maintained what's made Target successful and unique for nearly 60 years. We've maintained our focus on offering affordable design in support of a unique merchandise assortment, providing a differentiated and outstanding shopping experience, investing in the best team in retail and giving back to the communities that sustain us. This is another example of what we call the power of end. The reason Target has stayed relevant for so many decades is our ability to stay true to our values and continually evolve in the way we serve our guests. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael."

Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. An",1864,"Thanks, John. 
Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. And while it's our job to focus on driving performance every day, we've committed to making investment decisions with a long-term perspective, not limiting our horizon to a month, a season, a quarter or even a year, but thinking about how to position Target as a leading retailer for generations. 
That's how I think about our third quarter. In the face of multiple challenges in the external environment, we maintained our focus on our guests and took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position going into the holidays, even though those actions involve some incremental cost. And importantly, as we face those decisions, we had the resources we needed, including the best team in retail, a sophisticated global supply chain and a durable model that could accommodate those guest-focused investments. 
And while we're making these decisions with a focus on the long term, we've already seen the benefit of this year's inventory investments, given that they helped to power third quarter traffic and sales growth that exceeded our expectations. In addition, given strong expense discipline across the organization, we benefited from a compelling amount of leverage on our SG&A and D&A expenses, resulting in solid EPS growth despite the sizable investments we were choosing to make. 
As Brian mentioned, our 12.7% comp in the third quarter came on top of a nearly 21% increase a year ago. As expected, within the quarter, we saw a shift in a portion of our back-to-school sales back into August, given that most schools across the country began the school year with in-person learning. As a result, our August comp was our strongest of the quarter, our September comp dipped down to about 10%, and we accelerated back into the low teens in October. 
Among the component drivers of our sales, growth continues to be driven by traffic, even as we retain nearly all of the basket growth that happened a year ago. Specifically, third quarter traffic increased 12.9% on top of a 4.5% increase last year, while average ticket declined only slightly, about 20 basis points, after growing more than 15% a year ago. 
Among our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 9.7% in the quarter, on top of 9.9% last year, while digital comp sales grew 29%, on top of 155% growth a year ago. 
Within our digital fulfillment, sales on orders shipped to home increased slightly over last year, while same-day services grew about 60%, on top of a more than 200% increase a year ago. Among those same-day options, both in-store pickup and shipped grew more than 30% in the quarter, while Drive-Up grew more than 80%, on top of more than 500% a year ago. Put another way, since 2019, sales through drive-up have expanded more than 10x or about $1.4 billion in the third quarter alone. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 28% was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago. Among the drivers, core merchandising accounted for 2 percentage points or more than 3/4 of the rate decline, driven primarily by incremental freight and other inventory costs. Among the other gross margin drivers, payroll growth in our supply chain accounted for about 70 basis points of pressure, while category sales mix contributed about 10 basis points of benefit. 
Notably, digital fulfillment had an approximately neutral impact on gross margin rate in the quarter, as the costs associated with higher digital volume were offset by the benefit of a shift in fulfillment mix towards our same-day options, which have meaningfully lower average unit costs compared with traditional e-commerce. 
On the SG&A expense line, we saw about 160 basis points of improvement in the third quarter, reflecting disciplined cost management, combined with the leverage benefit of unexpectedly strong sales. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement, as sales growth more than offset the impact of higher accelerated depreciation, which reflects the continued ramp-up in our remodel program. 
All together, our third quarter operating margin rate of 7.8% was about 70 basis points lower than a year ago, but more than 2 percentage points higher than 2 years ago. On a dollar basis, operating income was 3.9% higher than a year ago and double the number recorded in the third quarter of 2019. 
Moving to the bottom of the P&L. Our third quarter GAAP EPS of $3.04 was 52% higher than last year when we recorded more than $500 million of interest expense on early debt retirement. On the adjusted EPS line, where we excluded early debt retirement expense, we earned $3.03 in the quarter, representing an 8.7% increase from a year ago. Compared with 2 years ago, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased more than 120%. 
Turning now to capital deployment. I'm going to start, as always, with our long-term priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we support the dividend and look to build on our long history of annual increases, which we maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we're returning the excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. 
On the CapEx line, we'd invested $2.5 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2021 and expect to reach about $3.3 billion for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, this is somewhat lower than our expectation going into the year and reflects the retiming of project spending into next year, given that we've experienced delays on some projects relating to external factors like permitting and inspections in some communities. 
However, as John mentioned earlier, we're eager to invest in a long list of productive growth opportunities over the next few years: adding new stores, remodeling existing stores, building replenishment capacity in our supply chain, and rolling out additional sortation centers. As of today, we continue to believe these investments will amount to CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range in 2022, and we'll continue to refine our view in the months ahead. 
Turning now to dividends. We paid $440 million in dividends in the third quarter, up $100 million from last year. This increase reflects a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. 
I want to pause here and take note of the fact that, with the payment of our December dividend, we'll officially achieve our 50th consecutive year of annual increases in the per share dividend, something very few companies have achieved. 
And lastly, given our cash position and strong cash generation by our operations, we continue to have ample capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our middle A ratings, even after we've made robust investments in CapEx and dividends. In the third quarter, we deployed $2.2 billion to repurchase 8.8 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date total up to $4.9 billion. 
As I've mentioned in prior quarters, given our continued strong financial performance, our debt leverage has been lower and cash on the balance sheet has been higher than we'd expect to maintain over the longer term. As a result, going forward, we expect to increase our leverage and reduce our cash position at a pace that's consistent with our financial expectations, credit rating goals and assessment of the external environment. I've mentioned before that the time line to move those metrics fully back to historical levels will likely be a multiyear journey. And the rapidly changing conditions we've seen over the last 2 years demonstrate why it's prudent to maintain a thoughtful pace. 
As always, I'll end my review of performance with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of our current performance in the context of the investments we've made over time. 
For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q3, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 31.3% compared with 19.9% a year ago. This is incredibly robust performance and demonstrates why we are enthusiastically planning to continue investing in our business. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. 
90 days ago, we said we were planning for high single-digit growth in our comparable sales over the back half of the year. While we still believe that's in the range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter, we just exceeded that expectation in Q3. As such, we're planning for a Q4 comp in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, consistent with the range we've seen over the last 2 quarters. 
In terms of profitability, we continue to expect that our business will deliver a full year operating margin rate of 8% or higher, up significantly from 7% in 2020. This rate favorability, combined with the full year sales growth we're positioned to deliver, would translate into another incredibly strong year of profit growth, following a record year in 2020. 
So now as I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to pause and address a question that I'm certain you'll be asking, which is, how much of the current cost pressures will turn out to be temporary and how much will turn out to be structural? And I'll give you the honest answer, which is that it's almost certainly some of both. And no one knows the precise answer. 
That said, there's no doubt that supply chain bottlenecks should ease over time. However, beyond the supply chain, we're also facing product cost increases from some vendors, driven by higher costs in their businesses. And while you heard from John that we're extremely well positioned given our team investments over the last few years, the labor market remains very tight across the country. 
So how do we think about the future? From a financial standpoint, we focus first on serving our guests and translating that focus into further growth, an area where we see a lot of runway. As you've seen with the investments we've made and continue to make, we're earning deeper trust and engagement from our guests. This trust leads to more trips and broader shopping across our merchandise assortment and fulfillment services. 
With a skilled and agile team focused on driving guest engagement, further growth and market share gains, we're confident that our durable model can continue to offer compelling value for our guests, accommodate continued investments in our team and deliver outstanding financial performance, even in the face of a challenging external environment like we're facing today. This is one more example of the power of and. 
So now I want to pause and thank our entire team for delivering a great Q3, which came on top of years of already strong performance. The financial results I have the privilege of sharing quarter after quarter wouldn't be possible if Target didn't have the best team in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian."

Before we turn to your questions, I want to pick up on something Michael just mentioned, which is the growing agility of our team. This comes in part from a heightened focus on prioritization in which we ask our team to focus on a small list of key enterprise-wide priorities, with a goal of making much more rapid progress towards the goals that matter most. 
With prioritization, we've also seen more alignment across the organization. Regardless of where specific team members might work, our enterprise priorities guide their decision-making, allowing them to take action and change course faster when facing rapidly changing external conditions. 
Beyond prioritization and alignment, we've also achieved a higher degree of collaboration. When tackling business problems, it becomes easier for everyone to communicate and partner cross-functionally to achieve our common goals together. 
Prioritization, alignment, collaboration, 3 important concepts that deliver compelling outcomes in a large organization like ours. And in our remarks today, you've heard us highlight some of those benefits, which helped drive strong Q3 performance despite challenging macro conditions: a unified focus on serving our guests; collaboration between merchandising, marketing and operations teams as they optimize holiday promotions; joint efforts between our stores, supply chain, merchants and vendors to address supply chain bottlenecks and find solutions in support of our inventory. 
To say we're feeling the impact of those benefits already this holiday season would be an understatement. In fact, I place them alongside our multi-category portfolio, our unmatched same-day services and the skill of our extraordinary team as keys to our holiday readiness. 
So once again, I want to thank our team. There is no question that because of their dedication and connection to our guests, we stand ready for an exceptionally strong holiday season. Throughout the team, across every function, I've seen the energy and passion as they prepare for the busiest season of the year. And I'm confident that same energy and passion will ensure Target's consistent and sustainable growth over the longer term as well. 
Now Christina, John, Michael and I would be happy to take your questions."

And some of those levers, think of expediting product to come at a cost, and you saw some of that in the third quarter. But I feel really good about the payoff from an investment decision like that.

Those numbers are actually stronger than we might have expected to see the consistent growth across every one of our major merchandising categories, double-digit growth, just the way the guest was responding to our assortment the value we were delivering the great in-store experience, those were all really positive results in the quarter and actually exceeded our expectations when we were planning for Q3."

But as Christina can build in more detail, we're also seeing tremendous growth in our beauty business, and ongoing strength in household essentials. And that's helping drive trips and leads to cross shopping across our multi-category portfolio. So the position we're in today in food and beverage is dramatically different from where we were 5 years ago. We're connecting with the guest.

Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now.

Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now. And they continue to demonstrate the extraordinary level of engagement we're seeing from our guests, both with our brand and with our team. 
In the third quarter, comparable sales expanded 12.7%, on top of a nearly 21% increase one year ago. Consistent with recent quarters, traffic was the primary driver of this year's growth as our guests increasingly turned to Target to serve their wants and needs. Across our sales channels, store sales were the primary growth driver this quarter, while same-day services propelled our digital growth. 
Since the third quarter of 2019, prior to the pandemic, Q3 store sales have expanded by $3.8 billion, while digital sales have increased another $3.1 billion. This provides a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of our operating model to serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. All of these results reflect the level of guest engagement far beyond what many would have imagined a few years ago, when we started making huge investments throughout our business, in our stores, new brands, same-day services, supply chain, and importantly, our team. 
Back then, Target was already known for our world-class team, a differentiated shopping experience, unique assortment and an iconic brand. But we knew there was much more to do. We saw a clear opportunity to build on that solid foundation, finding new ways to enhance our capabilities, while strengthening the bond with both our team and our guests. And today, those bonds have never been stronger. As I mentioned, within our digital capabilities, more and more of our guests are trying and embracing our industry-leading same-day services. Third quarter sales through these services have expanded by nearly 400% or $2 billion over the last 2 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, sales through these services have grown by more than $6 billion since 2019, a number larger than the total sales of many prominent retailers. 
Beyond fulfillment capabilities, our balanced multi-category assortment is another key driver of flexibility and resiliency within our business model. The breadth of our assortment, both within and across our core categories, allows our team to quickly and seamlessly serve our guests, even when their wants and needs are changing rapidly. 
In the third quarter, we saw consistent strong growth across our entire merchandising portfolio. More specifically, all 5 of our core merchandise categories saw a double-digit growth in the quarter, ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-teens, resulting in strong market share gains on top of unprecedented share growth in 2020. 
And we're not slowing down in our efforts to serve our guests. We continue to invest in key partnerships that enhance our assortment and experience, including the opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops and our recent announcement that we're doubling the number of enhanced Apple experiences in electronics. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. 
In our conference call 3 months ago, we outlined multiple actions we're taking to support our inventory and in-stocks, given the supply chain challenges that have emerged throughout the pandemic. As you know, those pressures only intensified in the third quarter. And our team has done an outstanding job in the face of these challenges, identifying bottlenecks and finding solutions to keep inventory flowing throughout our network. 
Although efforts drove some incremental costs in the quarter, we view them as a continuation of the many productive long-term investments we're making in our business in support of the trust we have built with our guests. And obviously, our guests responded to these efforts with strong third quarter traffic, which we expect will continue in Q4 and beyond. 
Beyond our supply chain, the team has done a great job navigating through broader cost pressures as many vendors have raised wholesale prices to accommodate higher costs within their businesses. As our team faced these cost increases, they maintained a guest-first approach and a focus on value while managing overall profitability as well. As a result, our business delivered strong third quarter financial results, from the top to the bottom of the P&L, while building on the trust we've established with our guests. 
So I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of our teams across the company, from headquarters to stores, from our merchandising, distribution and transportation teams to our sourcing offices around the world. Because of your agility, energy and selfless collaboration, Target delivered for our guests and our shareholders in the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter and ramp up for the peak holiday season, we're really well positioned to continue delivering for all of our stakeholders and close out an already amazing year. I want to thank you for everything you do. 
So the theme you'll hear in today's call is that we're excited and ready for the holiday season. We know our guests are excited to celebrate, following a year in 2020 when many families stayed apart due to safety concerns. This year, our guests have eagerly started their holiday shopping, as they respond to our holiday promotions, low price guarantees and our ongoing efforts to provide ease, reliability, safety and value across every shopping experience. 
And importantly, we have taken multiple actions to support our guests during the holiday season and beyond. On top of the investments in inventory, in-stocks and value I outlined earlier, we've announced that we're hiring 30,000 new year-round supply chain team members to support our current and expected growth. 
In our stores, we're providing our team members with more pay, flexibility and reliable hours this holiday season, offering more than 5 million additional hours to our existing team, and investment of more than $75 million over the holiday season. To supplement the additional hours from our existing team, we're hiring another 100,000 seasonal team members throughout the country, many of whom will have an opportunity to stay on with Target after the holidays. 
And importantly, during a season in which our guests are busier than any other time of the year, our merchandising and marketing teams are focused on cutting through the clutter. That means we're keeping our marketing messages and promotions simple and our operations flexible to offer an easy and reliable experience for our guests no matter how they choose to shop. 
And finally, while Target has already had an outstanding year, our team is looking ahead and not slowing down. We're continuing to invest in our future, in our new stores and existing stores, our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, in our owned and national brands, and the safety and well-being of our team. 
We're investing in Target Forward, an ambitious commitment to co-create an equitable and regenerative future. Together with our guests, partners and communities. All of these efforts are focused on advancing Target's leadership position within retail, taking a guest-led approach to everything we do and supporting our company values to care, grow and win together. 
I had the privilege of working alongside this great team as they bring our values to life every day across every part of the company. I'm endlessly grateful for their passion and support of our guests of our brand and for each other. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina."

Our third quarter results demonstrate what happens when our team lives out our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. When we lead with our guests first, we continue to build upon the trust that we have carefully earned with them over time. And when our strategies are guest-led, we grow our business, which supports our team, our financial performance and our ability to give back to our communities and the planet. 
As you heard from Brian, third quarter comparable sales grew 12.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in every one of our core merchandising categories. Even within those core categories, sales strength was broad-based, and virtually every area of the business grew over last year. This shows the power of our multi-category assortment in driving guest relevance and affinity for Target. 
While growth came from all categories, third quarter performance was led by our Essentials, Beauty and Food & Beverage categories, all of which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens. These businesses continue to deliver substantial share gains on top of last year's gains through both trip frequency and basket growth. 
In Essentials, growth was led by baby care, pets and over-the-counter health care categories. Strength in Food & Beverage was most notable in our fresh and frozen categories as well as in snacks and candy. Hardlines, which comped in the mid-teens on top of mid-30% comps last year, was fueled by incredible momentum in our toys and sporting goods businesses, which both saw comp growth north of 20%. Electronics delivered low single-digit comp growth on top of last year's comp of nearly 60%. 
In our Apparel business, comp sales grew in the low double-digits despite unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. Performance was strongest in swim, young contemporary, intimates and hosiery. In Home, low double-digit comp growth was led by seasonal and stationary categories, and reflected record-setting performance in the back-to-school, back-to-college and Halloween seasons. 
We have seen consistently strong results across seasonal categories, results that clearly signal that our guests are excited to celebrate the holidays with loved ones in new, old and reimagined ways. However they celebrate, our guests remain focused on meeting their wants and needs with ease, convenience and value. And as the holidays approach, they are turning to Target for these solutions. This is about more than just checking items off the list. Beyond working through the logistics of the holiday, our guests are looking to us to provide joy, and a joyous holiday is exactly what we plan to deliver. 
We continuously evaluate our guests' mindset, which serves as a North Star for all our strategies and decisions. We remain laser-focused on their experiences with us and expectations of us. And we strive to build flexibility and agility into our plans to ensure we show up at our best for them during the holidays and all year round. 
We are confident in our ability to navigate the broader retail landscape. And we're eager to share all that we've planned for the upcoming holidays. Whether our guests are rekindling old holiday traditions or finding new ways to celebrate the season, we're focused on making Target the destination that makes it easy, safe, inspiring and affordable to celebrate what matters most, the magic of spending time with those we love. 
As John will outline in more detail, our teams are working diligently to get the right inventory to the right place at the right time. Doing so has driven some near-term gross margin pressure, appropriate long-term investment in the relationship with our guests. Bottom line, based on the incredible efforts of our team, we feel good about our inventory levels heading into the holiday season. 
In addition to the investments in our inventory position, we remain committed to providing great value with every trip to Target. And that value goes far beyond delivering exceptional everyday pricing. It includes offering compelling holiday deals, great quality products and an array of options to support all budgets, including accessible payment options. 
Last year, we spread our promotions throughout the months of November and December to avoid crowding in stores, and we heard from our guests that they loved it. As a result, we're spreading savings throughout the season again this year to give guests flexibility to get the best deals on their terms whenever and however they choose to shop. We'll feature compelling offers throughout the season on top items, great weekly deals and surprise deals of the day, both in-store and online, as well as additional deals for Target Circle members. 
And to reinforce value throughout the season, we recently announced the launch of our Holiday Price Match Guarantee, our most robust price match ever. When guests see Holiday Best deals at Target, they can shop confidently, knowing they are getting Black Friday sized savings with our best planned price of the season. In essence, any time they see a deal at Target, our guests can be confident it's the right time to buy. 
We also know that our guests want flexibility, not just in what they want to buy and how they want to shop, but how to manage their budget as well. That's why with the help of 2 new partners, Sezzle and Affirm, we've added new payment solutions that allow our guests to buy what they need now, take advantage of our best deals and pay at a pace that works best for them.
With a strong inventory position and a great value proposition, we're able to lean into our uniquely Target assortment to build upon our traditional offering great gifting ideas and easy gathering solutions, like even more creative Gingerbread House making kits, Bullseye's top toys and gift sets for any budget. Spanning beauty, apparel, food and beverage and more, these gifting options will bring together the best of only our Target-owned brands with curated national brands. And for those seeking extra inspiration, our thoughtfully curated digital shopping lists will bring the joyful discovery our guests love, helping them find the perfect gifts for anyone on their list, whether they are shopping our stores or on our site. 
In addition to gifting, guests are focused on gathering with friends and family. And we have everything they need to create memorable moments, whether it's preparing a delicious meal, throwing a festive family party or hosting a game night with friends. From Good & Gather cheeseboard starter kits and Favorite Day baked-goods, to Threshold fall collections, including festive baking dishes, serving platters in the color of the season, and an array of plates, linens and other table toppers, all $15 and under. We want to create joy for all of our guests this holiday season, and we are excited to do so with our most inclusive assortment to date. 
Throughout our digital and in-store shopping experience, our guests are sure to see themselves reflected in our culturally relevant gifting and gathering solutions. We'll highlight Black-owned businesses in Beauty, Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Home, including McBride Sisters wine pairings, Bipoc Author in our $10 book assortment and a limited time Black artist partnership in wrapping paper. And our guests will see themselves represented in inclusive gift card messaging and imagery, providing options that celebrate the many meaningful holidays of the season, including Kwanzaa and Hanukkah. 
We're also delivering joy beyond our holiday assortment by building on our incredible legacy of creating differentiated shop-in-shop experiences that drive traffic and inspire our guests. They continue to tell us how much they love our exciting and expanding partnerships, with brands like Disney, Ulta Beauty and Apple. 
With each partnership, we're adding excitement, convenience and newness for our guests, while unlocking incremental growth for each of the partners. So it's no surprise we're building on this momentum in time for the holiday season. We are tripling the number of Disney stores at Target locations and doubling our Apple shop-in-shop experiences. 
On top of that, of course, this will be our debut holiday season featuring Ulta Beauty at Target. And on the subject of Ulta Beauty at Target, our guests are telling us it's clearly hitting the bull's-eye, with makeup, skincare, bath and body, hair care and fragrance from more than 50 top brands now available at Ulta Beauty at Target. Both in stores and online, there's plenty to love about this new partnership, and we are so excited for all that is yet to come. 
And we'll build on our tradition of joy making partnerships this December when we will launch an exclusive lifestyle collection of products with one of the most beloved toy brands ever, Lego. Think brick-inspired hooded sweatshirts, colorful Lego-shaped tumblers and of course, iconic Lego brick and mini figure sets. This collection builds on our long-standing partnership with the Lego Group and reflects our shared values of inclusivity, optimism and joy. With nearly 300 must-haves for the family, pets and home, and most of the colorful brick inspired items under $30, our guests are sure to find something everyone will love on any budget. 
Joy, ease, value, inclusivity, the ingredients helping to deliver on our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, a recipe that we refine quarter after quarter by listening to our guests, learning from their choices and working across our talented team. And these plans wouldn't come to life without the many talents and contributions of our dedicated team. 
So with deep gratitude and humility, I want to thank our team for serving the communities, for showing up every day for our guests and each other, and for bringing Target's values to life. You inspire me with all that you do. And because of you, I know we will win this holiday season. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

On our supply chain team, the focus is on moving the right amount of inventory to the right place at the right time. In our stores, which fulfill more than 95% of our total sales, the team focuses on delivering a great guest experience across hundreds of millions of guest transactions every quarter. And on our properties team, the team focuses on optimizing our physical footprint, including the planning and construction of new stores and distribution facilities, along with our investments to maintain and enhance the productivity of our existing buildings.
Of course, all of these aspects of operations matter all year long. But in the fourth quarter, when we handle the largest volumes of the year, everything moves faster, making the need for detailed planning and precise execution even greater. That's why, every year, we construct our plans with the fourth quarter in mind so we can remove distractions and roadblocks in advance of the holiday peak. That means on the properties team, we plan our remodeling new store projects so they're completed before the holidays. And our technology team rolls out new systems and tools on the same time line. In the supply chain and in our stores, we carefully plan the ramp-up of seasonal hiring and team member training in advance of the holidays so everyone is ready to handle the additional volume. 
That's what happens every year. But as Brian and Christina have already mentioned, this year, our teams have been facing additional out-of-the-ordinary challenges as they plan for and deliver record-setting volumes while facing unprecedented bottlenecks in the global supply chain. So while I'm lucky to work with our amazing team every day, it's at times like these that our team shines brightest. 
Beyond their skill and expertise, they face every challenge with good nature and a collaborative mindset. I can't describe how proud I am to represent everything they've accomplished this year, as they've delivered historically strong growth on top of record increases a year ago. 
Within our supply chain, the team has been methodically working around multiple obstacles and challenges throughout the network, prioritizing our holiday-sensitive categories within our import receipts, while thoughtfully planning domestic transportation to ensure products reach the shelf at the right time. And while we continue to see some periodic outages across different items and categories, we're entering the holidays with a very healthy inventory position overall. 
Specifically, at the end of the third quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was more than $2 billion higher than last year, representing growth of about 18% from a year ago. Looking back to the pre-COVID period, our Q3 ending inventory has grown more than $3.5 billion since the end of Q3 2019, representing 31% growth over a 2-year period. A sizable amount of this inventory will continue to flow to our stores over the next few weeks. And our team has clear visibility to where the inventory is located and when it will arrive in our stores. 
In our overseas operations, we've benefited from a significant reduction in delay times. And of course, given that we were already anticipating tight conditions many months ago, the team has been writing this year's holiday purchase orders much earlier than last year to proactively mitigate the risk of both known and unexpected delays. 
We're also benefiting from really strong performance across our domestic transportation network. And we've secured the necessary capacity across both rail and over-the-road trucking to accommodate anticipated shipments throughout the fourth quarter. 
At the intersection of our overseas and domestic supply chains, the team continues to work around significant port delays, diverting shipments to less congested entry points and relying on air freight in certain cases. And while Target's port operations have long been considered best-in-class, our team has been actively collaborating with government and port officials to help find solutions that will allow everyone's containers to move through the ports more quickly. And we're encouraged with the changes that have recently been put in place. 
I also want to pause and emphasize the ongoing collaboration that's been happening between our supply chain, merchandising and marketing teams. These teams have worked together to develop promotional and marketing plans that are much more fluid and nimble than in the past, enabling the incorporation of real-time data on inventory availability and location within our holiday plans in order to maximize their impact to the benefit of both our guests and operations. 
In our stores, the team has been preparing for fourth quarter all year. And they're energized and ready to serve our guests throughout the season. This will be the first holiday season since we launched our new service initiative, which is all about empowering our teams and increasing their confidence to build authentic connections with our guests. Also new this year, we've rolled out a new point-of-sale system across more than 90% of our stores, providing more speed, efficiency and enhanced experience at both the checkout and our service counter. 
To continue building on our industry-leading in-store Pickup and Drive Up experiences, we've been rolling out new capabilities all year. These efforts include capital projects to add permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, investing in flexible fixtures to provide temporary storage areas to support seasonal peak, adding thousands of new items to the list available for Pickup and Drive Up, doubling the number of Drive Up parking stalls compared with last year, and designating stall numbers to help our teams deliver Drive Up orders more efficiently. 
Even as we're adding these new capabilities, we're also supporting our long-standing commitment to providing a safe shopping experience, maintaining the enhanced COVID cleaning and safety routines that we implemented throughout the pandemic. We've also been investing in team member hours, processes and training to prepare our team to handle record freight and fulfillment volumes this year, all while enhancing safety messaging and actively monitoring processes to protect the safety of both our guests and our team. 
And of course, as Brian mentioned, our team is focused on being fully staffed across the store and supply chain throughout the holiday season. Our stores have been hitting their seasonal hiring milestones. And because of the advancements we've made in scheduling this year, average hours per store team member are running significantly higher this year in comparison to past years. In fact, unlike what you're hearing from many others, because of the investments we've made in pay and benefits and our focus on team member training and engagement, the hourly turnover rate in our stores is actually running lower this year compared with 2019, particularly for our newly hired team members. 
And we're continuing to invest in our team. Following the recent rollout of the most comprehensive debt-free education program in the industry, we announced that to sustain our momentum through the holidays, we're offering pay premiums during peak periods in our stores and distribution centers over the holiday season. As we've said many times, our investments in the team are the most productive ones we've made. 
Turning to the work of the properties team. We expect to finish about 145 remodels in 2021, having completed more than 40 remodels prior to the end of Q3, with more than 100 additional projects slated to wrap up before the holiday. The team also opened another 15 new stores in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to 30. Among those projects, we've opened new stores ranging from 11,000 to 160,000 square feet, which demonstrates the flexibility we've developed to design the optimal store size for an individual neighborhood, based on their local needs and available real estate in the market. 
To increase the capacity and efficiency of our supply chain, our team has also opened 2 new distribution centers this year. In addition, we have 2 new sortation centers set to open in the fourth quarter, with 2 more on track to open early next year. 
While our supply chain has had to address a host of unique challenges, I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of our construction team, which enabled them to successfully bring a huge number of store and distribution projects to completion this year. These are highly complex projects across multiple geographies, which require precise coordination across a large number of regional construction providers, along with a diverse group of fixture and equipment vendors, all of whom have been facing the same bottlenecks we've been facing in our merchandise supply chain. Our construction team has handled all of these challenges with good humor and resilience, allowing us to continue reaching guests in new neighborhoods and support the growing supply chain needs of the entire chain. 
In support of those growing needs, we recently announced that we're adding more than 30,000 permanent positions across our supply chain network to support the growth we expect to continue delivering in the fourth quarter and beyond. These team members will support new buildings in our regional DC network, adding replenishment capacity to support an increasingly productive store network. They'll also be staffing and supporting our new sortation centers, which deliver efficiency, speed and additional capacity in support of last-mile fulfillment. 
And it's amazing to pause and look back at how much our network needs have grown in a short time. For the entire fiscal year in 2018, our business generated $74 billion in sales. Less than 3 years later, our business had already delivered $74 billion in sales through the third quarter, with the biggest quarter of the year still ahead of us. Our team and supply chain infrastructure have done an outstanding job in supporting that growth. And given that we don't expect it to end anytime soon, we are committed to growing our physical footprint and our team so they can continue to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders in Q4 and beyond. 
When I first started working here in 1996, Target delivered just under $18 billion in revenue, for what was then called Dayton Hudson Corporation. While many things have changed since then, both in retail and at this company, we successfully maintained what's made Target successful and unique for nearly 60 years. We've maintained our focus on offering affordable design in support of a unique merchandise assortment, providing a differentiated and outstanding shopping experience, investing in the best team in retail and giving back to the communities that sustain us. 
This is another example of what we call the power of 'and'. The reason Target has stayed relevant for so many decades is our ability to stay true to our values and continually evolve in the way we serve our guests. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael."

Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. And",1865,"Thanks, John. Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. And while it's our job to focus on driving performance every day, we've committed to making investment decisions with a long-term perspective, not limiting our horizon to a month, a season, a quarter or even a year, but thinking about how to position Target as a leading retailer for generations. 
That's how I think about our third quarter. In the face of multiple challenges in the external environment, we maintained our focus on our guests and took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position going into the holidays, even though those actions involve some incremental cost. And importantly, as we face those decisions, we had the resources we needed, including the best team in retail, a sophisticated global supply chain and a durable model that could accommodate those guest-focused investments. 
And while we're making these decisions with a focus on the long term, we've already seen the benefit of this year's inventory investments, given that they helped to power third quarter traffic and sales growth that exceeded our expectations. In addition, given strong expense discipline across the organization, we benefited from a compelling amount of leverage on our SG&A and D&A expenses, resulting in solid EPS growth despite the sizable investments we were choosing to make. 
As Brian mentioned, our 12.7% comp in the third quarter came on top of a nearly 21% increase a year ago. As expected, within the quarter, we saw a shift in a portion of our back-to-school sales back into August, given that most schools across the country began the school year with in-person learning. As a result, our August comp was our strongest of the quarter, our September comp dipped down to about 10%, and we accelerated back into the low teens in October. 
Among the component drivers of our sales, growth continues to be driven by traffic, even as we retain nearly all of the basket growth that happened a year ago. Specifically, third quarter traffic increased 12.9% on top of a 4.5% increase last year, while average ticket declined only slightly, about 20 basis points, after growing more than 15% a year ago. Among our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 9.7% in the quarter, on top of 9.9% last year, while digital comp sales grew 29%, on top of 155% growth a year ago. 
Within our digital fulfillment, sales on orders shipped to home increased slightly over last year, while same-day services grew about 60%, on top of a more than 200% increase a year ago. Among those same-day options, both in-store Pickup and Shipt grew more than 30% in the quarter, while Drive Up grew more than 80%, on top of more than 500% a year ago. Put another way, since 2019, sales through Drive Up have expanded more than 10x or about $1.4 billion in the third quarter alone. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 28% was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago. Among the drivers, core merchandising accounted for 2 percentage points or more than 3/4 of the rate decline, driven primarily by incremental freight and other inventory costs. Among the other gross margin drivers, payroll growth in our supply chain accounted for about 70 basis points of pressure, while category sales mix contributed about 10 basis points of benefit. 
Notably, digital fulfillment had an approximately neutral impact on gross margin rate in the quarter, as the costs associated with higher digital volume were offset by the benefit of a shift in fulfillment mix towards our same-day options, which have meaningfully lower average unit costs compared with traditional e-commerce. 
On the SG&A expense line, we saw about 160 basis points of improvement in the third quarter, reflecting disciplined cost management, combined with the leverage benefit of unexpectedly strong sales. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement, as sales growth more than offset the impact of higher accelerated depreciation, which reflects the continued ramp-up in our remodel program. 
Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 7.8% was about 70 basis points lower than a year ago, but more than 2 percentage points higher than 2 years ago. On a dollar basis, operating income was 3.9% higher than a year ago and double the number recorded in the third quarter of 2019. 
Moving to the bottom of the P&L. Our third quarter GAAP EPS of $3.04 was 52% higher than last year when we recorded more than $500 million of interest expense on early debt retirement. On the adjusted EPS line, where we excluded early debt retirement expense, we earned $3.03 in the quarter, representing an 8.7% increase from a year ago. Compared with 2 years ago, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased more than 120%. 
Turning now to capital deployment. I'm going to start, as always, with our long-term priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we support the dividend and look to build on our long history of annual increases, which we maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we're returning the excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. 
On the CapEx line, we'd invested $2.5 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2021 and expect to reach about $3.3 billion for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, this is somewhat lower than our expectation going into the year and reflects the retiming of project spending into next year, given that we've experienced delays on some projects relating to external factors like permitting and inspections in some communities. 
However, as John mentioned earlier, we're eager to invest in a long list of productive growth opportunities over the next few years: adding new stores, remodeling existing stores, building replenishment capacity in our supply chain, and rolling out additional sortation centers. As of today, we continue to believe these investments will amount to CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range in 2022, and we'll continue to refine our view in the months ahead. 
Turning now to dividends. We paid $440 million in dividends in the third quarter, up $100 million from last year. This increase reflects a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. I want to pause here and take note of the fact that, with the payment of our December dividend, we'll officially achieve our 50th consecutive year of annual increases in the per share dividend, something very few companies have achieved. 
And lastly, given our cash position and strong cash generation by our operations, we continue to have ample capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our middle A ratings, even after we've made robust investments in CapEx and dividends. In the third quarter, we deployed $2.2 billion to repurchase 8.8 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date total up to $4.9 billion. 
As I've mentioned in prior quarters, given our continued strong financial performance, our debt leverage has been lower and cash on the balance sheet has been higher than we'd expect to maintain over the longer term. As a result, going forward, we expect to increase our leverage and reduce our cash position at a pace that's consistent with our financial expectations, credit rating goals and assessment of the external environment. 
I've mentioned before that the time line to move those metrics fully back to historical levels will likely be a multiyear journey. And the rapidly changing conditions we've seen over the last 2 years demonstrate why it's prudent to maintain a thoughtful pace. 
As always, I'll end my review of performance with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of our current performance in the context of the investments we've made over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q3, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 31.3% compared with 19.9% a year ago. This is incredibly robust performance and demonstrates why we are enthusiastically planning to continue investing in our business. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. 90 days ago, we said we were planning for high single-digit growth in our comparable sales over the back half of the year. While we still believe that's in the range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter, we just exceeded that expectation in Q3. As such, we're planning for a Q4 comp in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, consistent with the range we've seen over the last 2 quarters. 
In terms of profitability, we continue to expect that our business will deliver a full year operating margin rate of 8% or higher, up significantly from 7% in 2020. This rate favorability, combined with the full year sales growth we're positioned to deliver, would translate into another incredibly strong year of profit growth, following a record year in 2020. 
So now as I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to pause and address a question that I'm certain you'll be asking, which is, how much of the current cost pressures will turn out to be temporary and how much will turn out to be structural? And I'll give you the honest answer, which is that it's almost certainly some of both. And no one knows the precise answer. 
That said, there's no doubt that supply chain bottlenecks should ease over time. However, beyond the supply chain, we're also facing product cost increases from some vendors, driven by higher costs in their businesses. And while you heard from John that we're extremely well positioned given our team investments over the last few years, the labor market remains very tight across the country. 
So how do we think about the future? From a financial standpoint, we focus first on serving our guests and translating that focus into further growth, an area where we see a lot of runway. As you've seen with the investments we've made and continue to make, we're earning deeper trust and engagement from our guests. This trust leads to more trips and broader shopping across our merchandise assortment and fulfillment services. 
With a skilled and agile team focused on driving guest engagement, further growth and market share gains, we're confident that our durable model can continue to offer compelling value for our guests, accommodate continued investments in our team and deliver outstanding financial performance, even in the face of a challenging external environment like we're facing today. This is one more example of the power of 'and'. 
So now I want to pause and thank our entire team for delivering a great Q3, which came on top of years of already strong performance. The financial results I have the privilege of sharing quarter after quarter wouldn't be possible if Target didn't have the best team in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian."

Before we turn to your questions, I want to pick up on something Michael just mentioned, which is the growing agility of our team. This comes in part from a heightened focus on prioritization in which we ask our team to focus on a small list of key enterprise-wide priorities, with a goal of making much more rapid progress towards the goals that matter most. 
With prioritization, we've also seen more alignment across the organization. Regardless of where specific team members might work, our enterprise priorities guide their decision-making, allowing them to take action and change course faster when facing rapidly changing external conditions. 
Beyond prioritization and alignment, we've also achieved a higher degree of collaboration. When tackling business problems, it becomes easier for everyone to communicate and partner cross-functionally to achieve our common goals together. 
Prioritization, alignment, collaboration, 3 important concepts that deliver compelling outcomes in a large organization like ours. And in our remarks today, you've heard us highlight some of those benefits, which helped drive strong Q3 performance despite challenging macro conditions: a unified focus on serving our guests; collaboration between merchandising, marketing and operations teams as they optimize holiday promotions; joint efforts between our stores, supply chain, merchants and vendors to address supply chain bottlenecks and find solutions in support of our inventory. 
To say we're feeling the impact of those benefits already this holiday season would be an understatement. In fact, I place them alongside our multi-category portfolio, our unmatched same-day services and the skill of our extraordinary team as keys to our holiday readiness. 
So once again, I want to thank our team. There is no question that because of their dedication and connection to our guests, we stand ready for an exceptionally strong holiday season. Throughout the team, across every function, I've seen the energy and passion as they prepare for the busiest season of the year. And I'm confident that same energy and passion will ensure Target's consistent and sustainable growth over the longer term as well. 
Now Christina, John, Michael and I would be happy to take your questions."

And pulling all the levers within the system to ensure we're there for the guest has been our priority. And some of those levers, think of expediting product to come at a cost, and you saw some of that in the third quarter.

But we've certainly seen supply chain challenges going all the way to the start of the pandemic as demand across the U.S. continued to build. So we've done a terrific job.

But we don't expect those supply chain challenges to go away as we go into the start of next year. And I think they'll dissipate over time. 
So we're doing our fair share to make sure that we're alleviating some of the congestion in the ports and making sure that we're unpacking containers and off-peak hours. We've utilized other ports across the country to try to relieve some of the congestion in L.A. Long Beach. But as John can attest, we know that we're going to still face some supply chain challenges as we go into 2022. There's still uncertainty as we think about supply from Asia as different factories from time to time are closed. And we're just going to have to show great flexibility and agility to provide the products that our guests are looking for and our system requires as we plan for the next fiscal year."

And this really goes back a little bit like the supply chain thing. This is something we've been on top of for a very long time. We've made investing in our team an absolute priority. You've seen us do that for years now, investments in wage, investments in training, investments in benefits and investments in their safety over the past couple of years. 
And so that all starts and leads to retaining our current team. And from our perspective, that's the way we achieve our staffing goals, is retain the team we have. This year, particularly in our stores, we spent a lot of time, individual conversations with every team member about what's the hours they want and what can we do to cross-train you to get you the hours you need. And so that's been a huge success for our team and for us as we've looked at staffing.
More recently, we've said we're investing in our DC team, our supply chain teams to grow the staffing, and we feel great about applicant flow. We feel great about the turnover of our team. It's below 2019 right now. So overall, we feel we're really well positioned for the fourth quarter, and more importantly, for beyond the fourth quarter, because labor is going to continue to be tight, and we'll continue to focus on retaining our existing team."

To see our traffic grow by almost 13% was something that we actually didn't anticipate. We certainly were planning for a very strong quarter and continued market share gains. 
But to see the type of performance across our business, the strength of stores, comping up almost 10%, in a period when we were comping over a 9.9% growth rate in the prior year, to see our digital business grow by almost 30%, comping over 155% growth the year before, those numbers are actually stronger than we might have expected. To see the consistent growth across every one of our major merchandising categories, double-digit growth, just the way the guest was responding to our assortment, the value we were delivering, the great in-store experience, those were all really positive results in the quarter and actually exceeded our expectations when we were planning for Q3.
