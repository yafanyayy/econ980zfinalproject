Okay. Well, good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. 
To start off this morning, I'll spend some time talking about our sales results, trends over the 12 weeks, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. As I said in our press release this morning, we could not deliver the kind of results we had without the heroic efforts of our store and supply chain AutoZoners. While classified as essential workers, essential seems insufficient to describe their remarkable contributions to our company, our customers and our results. Our AutoZoners have really stepped up during the pandemic, have been nothing short of exceptional. And our top priority remains being committed to providing all of our AutoZoners with a safe work environment to be sure -- so they can help our customers. 
While Jamere will talk more about this when he discusses the investments we've been making, I will say the additional emergency time-off or ETO we offered is something we just knew was the right thing to do for our AutoZoners. Thank you, AutoZoners again. 
Okay. Let's turn to our sales results. Our overall comp sales were up 15.2% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong this quarter with retail comps being slightly stronger than commercial. Commercial came on strong at the end of the quarter and comped similarly to retail for the last 4 weeks. 
Let's review our sales cadence. We told you on our last call, we ran an 8.8% comp for the last 4 weeks of Q1. In the first 4 weeks of this quarter, our sales accelerated to a 10.7% comp. As the holidays arrived, we saw further acceleration, which was sustained for the balance of the quarter. We ran a 17.5% comp pretty consistently over the last 8 weeks of the quarter. 
This quarter's traffic versus ticket growth was pretty close to split down the middle although ticket was slightly stronger. It was encouraging us for us to see sales inflect upwards starting in January, with both ticket and traffic moving higher. Our ticket growth was stronger this quarter due to hard part sales mixing higher than what we experienced in the first quarter. 
Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow all the national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs on the CDC guidelines. We continue to require masks entering our facilities, perform questionnaires of our team members and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing masks, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. 
And just last week, we announced that we would provide every AutoZoner with a $100 reward once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This is just the next logical step in our efforts to provide a safe, working and shopping environment. I continue to be inspired by our Board and our management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first. You see, our values and our culture have been in full force and effect over the last year in this pandemic. 
Addressing our supply chain, we've done a solid job with handling the extra demand, and our in-stock levels have continued to improve. To provide a little more color on industry drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further and further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits that ended last July. In the first week of January, over $100 billion of stimulus was distributed to Americans. The majority of these funds was for the onetime checks as part of the $600 billion stimulus package passed in late December. While smaller in size than the April disbursements, we did see our business pick up nicely, and our sales remained elevated throughout the remainder of the quarter. While we continue to be encouraged with the current selling environment, we feel any additional stimulus should lead to a strong sales environment. 
During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country perform well, with the Midwest and northeastern markets underperforming the others pretty consistently. Again, these markets, which represent just over 25% of our store base, were solid but not as strong as the remaining markets. For example, the spread in comp sales between these markets and the others was approximately 300 basis points for the quarter. We believe the separation was due to lingering effects of a mild winter last year and colder weather happening later this winter. 
But winter did come this year. Boy, did it? And the performance gap closed. So we are encouraged about the summertime and believe we won't have to discuss why mild winter affected comp sales during our upcoming fourth quarter. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the mid single-digit range, with our sales closer to 3x the industry's growth rate. While we are thrilled to have these share gains now, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the spring and summer months. 
I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about sales for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '21. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. 
We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the third fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have a much more difficult comparison in the fourth fiscal quarter as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package. For now, it remains difficult for us to predict sales for the remainder of the year. This is especially true for the fourth quarter of this year when we were up against the fourth quarter of previous year's 21.8% comp store sales growth. While we continue to expect our sales growth will moderate over time, we believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. 
Over the long term, if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last 3 recessions. Last quarter, we reminded you the strongest periods we'd experienced of outside sales growth over the last 3 decades have been the early '90s, '01 and '02, '09, '10 and '11, all coming out of recessionary environments. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. 
Interestingly, after each of those outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retained many of those customers in the years that followed. 
Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 15.2% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $346 million. And our EPS was $14.93 a share, 20.5% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 16% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 15%. For commercial, we averaged over $53 million in weekly sales, which was over $10,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as the winter months are lower selling months for us. 
Moving forward, we remain very encouraged with what we are doing within our commercial business. The initiatives we have in place are helping our sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. 
While there were some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales force categories continue to be strong, with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. In fact, our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This is the first quarter since the pandemic began where we saw our hard parts grow in line with sales floor. 
While business improved in many merchandise categories such as batteries, categories like brakes and rotors are not comping as high as the overall business. We believe this performance gap with certain categories will close as miles driven continue to improve. As for this year's winter, it was late arriving but it did arrive. Overall, we view the winter as not having a material impact on our upcoming spring and summer business one way or the other. 
We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. 
On last quarter's call, we announced we would be expensing additional payroll during the second quarter. The additional expense was to provide our AutoZoners with more emergency time-off. While this is the second time in our history we've offered ETO benefits, we believe it is the least we could do to support our AutoZoners in the field. This extra time-off award has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. Our AutoZoners have the right to use the benefits to address medical emergencies, take time off to get the vaccine, take additional paid vacation time-off or wait until the end of the calendar year and get paid what remains in their incremental vacation bank. 
In January, we paid out $31 million to AutoZoners who didn't utilize the ETO we offered them back in March of 2020. I have to tell you, it was an honor to provide these AutoZoners with sizable checks in recognition of their heroic efforts. We feel this is a very important investment in our AutoZoners and in their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. To st",2394,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $2.9 billion, up 16%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q2 last year. 
Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business. For the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 14.7% to $639 million. Sequentially, commercial growth was nearly 3 points higher than Q1. In the quarter, sales to our commercial customers represented 22% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $10,500, up 11.7%. We averaged $53 million in total weekly commercial sales. 
Internally, we have been executing against our commercial acceleration program where we are focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service, technology and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. 
This quarter, we opened 45 net new programs, finishing with 5,088 total programs. And our sales efficiency per store remained at near-record levels as we leveraged our DIY infrastructure and increased our share of wallet with existing customers. Let me be clear, our strategy is working. We believe we grew share and we remain focused on repeating this for the balance of fiscal 2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts, improvements in our assortment and parts covered by model year, more competitive pricing and a commitment to providing exceptional service. 
These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 3 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. And as we move forward, we are focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability. We opened 1 more Mega-Hub this quarter, bringing our total to 48 locations, and we expect to open between 7 and 10 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. Given the success of our Mega-Hubs and increasing parts availability and driving meaningful sales lift, we're now raising our target from 75 to 90 Mega-Hubs at build-out to 100 into 110. These stores help us expand coverage and say, yes, we have it more frequently. 
Second, we are leveraging technology to improve delivery times and service levels. The technology investments we're making in electronic ordering and tracking will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. We're making it simpler to do business with AutoZone, and we're driving efficiency for our sales professionals and drivers. 
Third, we are committed to being price competitive. We have a laser focus on the key categories where investment and pricing lead to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. We like the competitive hand that we have in our commercial business and believe we are in the early innings of a transformational growth story. 
Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our retail acceleration initiatives. We're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY share growth. Like the commercial initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are running an intense playbook in DIY that is driving solid results for our business. First, the assortment work and Mega-Hub strategy that I mentioned earlier drive tremendous benefits to our DIY business. Our investments are improving coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful impact on trial and repeat purchase activity. 
Second, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with the work we have done on the digital front. Our efforts in Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home have helped us meet customers win where and how they want to shop. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the customer experience and make it easier to shop our broad array of products. 
Third and similar to our commercial approach, we have a laser-like focus on being competitively priced in the marketplace. We're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to drive pricing decisions in certain categories, categories where we typically compete with nontraditional competitors like mass and online-only sellers in commodities and very slow-moving parts and products. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. This is a data-rich environment, and our tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. Again, we're living up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, and we believe it is helping us create a faster-growing business. 
Fourth, we simply have a relentless focus on execution. As Bill mentioned, our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have delivered exceptional results in a tough environment. As I said last quarter, perhaps the best investment we have made in our company is the investment in additional emergency time-off. In return, we continue to see our supply chain process record volume and our store AutoZoners handled record store traffic while still delighting our customers. This focus on execution is a meaningful competitive advantage for us and we're winning in the marketplace. 
Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. First, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores to finish with 628 stores and our store sales accelerated sequentially. Like last quarter, the exchange rate again played a role in the U.S. dollar equivalent reported sales. The exchange rate finished the quarter at roughly [ 7% ] higher than last year's second quarter rate. That's 7% higher than last quarter's second rate. And as a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. 
While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we're seeing signs of a turnaround in the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. 
Regarding Brazil, we opened 1 new store to finish with 46 stores this quarter. The Brazilian real continues to face headwinds and devalued roughly 25% for Q2 over last year. Long term, Brazil will be an important market for AutoZone and we will invest in a disciplined way. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 77 basis points. 37 basis points of margin headwind is due to higher supply chain costs, including a onetime benefit last year that did not repeat this year. The remaining 40 basis points came from our pricing initiatives, loyalty program and mix shift. As I discussed above, we're focused on competitive pricing that will drive top line and gross profit dollar gains. 
To be clear though, the industry's pricing remains rational, and overall, we still have pricing power. We have tested certain categories and taken action when we have the ability to drive both top line and gross profit dollar gains. This is a dynamic market and we remain disciplined in our approach. The strategy is working. We see our work translating into higher sales and profits, as evidenced by the transaction and share growth that Bill mentioned earlier. As we continue to refine our strategy over the next several quarters, we're planning for higher sales and gross profit dollars that outpace the drag from gross margin rate. This is a good outcome for our business as we're driving new customers and retention. 
All of the investments we are making suggest that we're growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. Again, our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Regarding operating expenses, our teams, particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses are up 12.5% versus last year's Q2. But included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $40 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses, which represented 4.2% of the overall SG&A growth. We believe our decision to provide emergency time-off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic was absolutely the right thing to do. As I said last quarter, this is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $482 million, up 18.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the last fiscal year's third quarter. We're planning interest in the same $46 million to $47 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $47.5 million in last year's third quarter. 
Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion versus last year's Q2 ending balance of just under $5.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And long term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
Moving to tax, our tax rate was 20.6% versus 17.7% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 265 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year, it benefited 412 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $346 million, up 15.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.2 million was lower by 4.1% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.93, up 20.5% over the prior year second quarter. 
Let me talk a few minutes about our cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $356 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $150 million over last year's Q2. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter versus $315 million last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2x. 
Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remained significantly higher than historical levels. We now have $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which approximately $830 million is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was flat versus Q2 last year. Inventory per store was $715,000 versus $713,000 last year and $702,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 2.8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. 
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $93,000 versus negative $41,000 last year and negative $99,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113% versus last year's Q2 of 105.7%. 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we restarted our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, began methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again. 
But we feel comfortable with our strategy and our execution. As I mentioned, we spent $900 million on stock repurchases, representing 752,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. This will enable us to grow our business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. 
So to wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and this gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Your grasp of the fundamentals of this business in less than 6 months is extraordinary, and thank you for being here. We're so glad you joined the team. 
These continue to be unique and extraordinary times, and they continue to require us to look at many things differently while managing our business day to day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. 
We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. They've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far, but we must stay focused and we must continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate and we must continue to execute. 
Our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well. We understand trends will slow in the future. We're going to work. We're going to work as hard as possible to gain as much share as possible and limit our headwinds. And we continue to see a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. Our business continues to do very well and we are still in the early innings of growth. 
But as always, we have work to do as we head into our spring selling season. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and our customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Yes, as you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades. We found some particular specific opportunities where we found places to invest and improve our value proposition to our customers. They're very specific pieces, both in the retail business and the commercial business. 
I don't know exactly what's going to happen a year from now. Our team is going to continue to innovate. We are constantly raising prices and we are constantly lowering prices, trying to find that sweet spot where our customers value -- the value that they're getting the best. So I don't know exactly what it's going to be over the long term. 
But if you recap and what Jamere said, the gross margin, we had about 40 basis points, which was a onetime negative from last year. So all the things that were embedded in there, of which price was one of them, accumulated to 40 basis points. Frankly, I'm not that smart to know what the gross margin is going to be within 40 basis points, 2 or 3 years from now."

We talked, I guess, probably 3 years ago that we were embarking on a new commercial study, and we developed a new strategy that we began rolling out probably 18 months or so ago. And we're still in the early innings of rolling out that strategy. It has many different elements. I mean, this Hub and Mega-Hub portion of the strategy, which is taking years but it is making a meaningful difference, a very meaningful difference in our ability to say yes to our customers. And it's leaning towards commercial although it's helping DIY tremendously as well. That's an element of it. 
We've rolled out new technology in our commercial business. Handheld technology, which allows us to be able to better understand what our delivery times are and manage our delivery times better. We're significantly already reduced our delivery times in the last 6 months and we think we have more room to go. We've also enhanced our website and our ability to communicate and be easy to do business with, with our commercial customers. 
So I don't think it's -- and then, of course, the ongoing evolution and building of the Duralast brand. So it's not 1 individual issue. It's an amalgamation of all these different issues coming together and improving our competitive position. Not to mention, during the global pandemic and the stay at home and safe at home orders, we were there for our customers every day. And that allowed us to introduce ourselves at a different level to some customers. And I think that has resulted in stickier long-term relationships."

What we're not seeing is we're not seeing a ton of cost pressures that are material. And industry pricing remains rational. So what we're doing is part of this strategy is very surgical. In other words, we're not peanut butter-spreading price declines across the business, but we're being very surgical using very sophisticated data and analytics. And those are the things that give us a lot of confidence that what we're doing makes a lot of sense for the consumer and makes a lot of sense for us.

And yes, you have to bifurcate it between what's going on in the retail sector versus what's going on in the commercial sector, both of which we're gaining share 2 or 3x -- we're growing 2 or 3x faster than the industry growth rates by all indications we have. We have really good data on the retail share gains. We don't have as good a data but we can look at headline growth numbers in the commercial gains. 
On retail, we are picking up a lot of share from what's traditionally, we believe, in the mass channel. I think a lot of people are not frequenting those large stores at the same rate that they did in the past. And what we're focused on is making sure, as we're getting those incremental visits, that we are going above and beyond so we get those visits in the future. 
I think also, as this brick-and-mortar omnichannel strategy comes to place, I think we're also not losing share that we might have been losing before to the online channel, and in fact, maybe gaining some of that share back over time. In the commercial sector, I think it's hard to say where the share is coming from. We are less than 4% market share in the commercial industry today. I think it's likely coming from probably multiple different places. 
We certainly have intensified our understanding of what the wholesale distributor market is doing, and we're paying more attention to them and our competitive analysis and building our strategy. And we think that over time, we've significantly changed our competitive position, particularly against the WDs. You think about what we've done with assortment, what we've done building a sales force and now we've got this technology that we have in place, it's going to improve our deliveries.

We've worked through most of those. I have to give our team and our battery suppliers some kudos that the battery business has been as strong as it's been for as long as it's been. And then we had this huge cold surge or cold snap and we did just fine. Our team was very creative and worked with lots of different suppliers to make sure we were in good shape.

I'm not sure how to answer it all. Clearly, I think we talked that we were worried. If anything, we might have pulled forward some battery business because those cars parked last spring, and they sat for 5 or 6 weeks, as soon as the safe at home went away, our battery business boomed. But that battery business has sustained really high levels ever since. We've seen no dip in our battery business. We've seen weeks where we're going up against tough winter weather where it might be softer. But overall, it has exceeded our expectations over the last 11 months. 
As far as sustainability of these sales surges, the thing that keeps resonating with me is if you think about our business over really long periods of time, when our customers have incremental time and specifically, incremental money, our business outperforms normal periods of time. And it's been that way for the last decade when we get tax refunds. How much have we talked in this environment about the surge we see during tax refund season, which is just beginning right now? We've seen it every single year. And when  tax refunds moved back 3 weeks, we had to spend a lot of time talking about it because it moved out of 1 quarter into another quarter. 
It's just evidence that when our customer who is financially fragile, when they get some incremental dollars, we seem to get a disproportionate share of those funds. And we saw it again in January when the stimulus came out. It wasn't nearly the stimulus that we saw last April, but within a day, within a day, we saw that those funds showing up in significantly improved business for us. And that sustained itself through the end of the quarter. 
Now we're talking about another stimulus, which could frankly could dwarf what happened last April. If that comes, what does that mean to our business? All the indications we have is it would be very strong for our business because each time we've seen those incremental dollars, our business has performed better than normal."

But there are still elements of the commercial business that aren't as strong as they were pre pandemic, particularly some of our national account players, the up and down the street business has been stronger than the national account business.

We're not wed to internal combustion engine technology. We've significantly changed our assortment over time to reflect the latest technology. So this is not an accidental threat for us. We're operating from a position of strength. 
If you think about our business today, we're already supplying parts and supplies to the EV market, things like wiper blades. We have world-class capabilities in supply chain and merchandising. We have great relationships and partnerships with the OEMs who have a seat at the table today and can help us forecast the volumes and the timing of the market changes. And we have this tremendous retail footprint in commercial business that gives us distribution points. 
So as we think about the parts and supplies that are at risk with electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, there will be offsets. I mean, there will be -- clearly, there'll be some things that are at risk but there will be offsets to those. And there'll be opportunities for us in both DIY and DIFM. 
So listen, despite what we see in headlines and announcements from the OEMs, we're a bit cautious because the market has some near-term challenges that we're watching closely. First of all, consumer adoption is uncertain. We -- roughly 2% of the market today and it's growing slowly. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, the charging infrastructure is not ready for prime time. The rapid charging stations need to be built out. It's going to be expensive. It's probably going to take some combination of public and private partnerships. The business model there has an uncertain path to profitability. And quite frankly, we think there's going to be some need for some pretty significant power grid investments. But we do believe there's going to be a market and we're going to be a player, and we're simply going to follow the consumer."

What we have seen in recent -- in this quarter is a resurgence of our hard parts business, in particular, some of the failure-related items. I think some of that has to do with actually getting into winter and having a more normal winter this year. 
We've also talked about our maintenance products not being at the same levels that we're experiencing in the rest of our business, things like brakes and rotors and the like. And I think that, that's personally a hold on from the lack of winter last year, and the fact that miles driven are down and those maintenance items for some of the higher socioeconomic groups may be negatively impacted."

Used to if somebody said Bill and it was a hard question, I would just look at Giles and let him answer it. But you put it on me this time. 
So let's talk about our digital business. In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where our customer's really picking a channel, they're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are 2 primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buckets. And we fulfill it the exact same way regardless of how they initially interact with us. 
We've been doing a lot of work trying to make, doing it digitally with us, easier and we've made significant strides, really proud of the team that's been doing that work over the last couple of years, in particular. And we've also made a lot of other back office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. 
And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone. We believe and hope over time that our percentage of digital penetration in the commercial business will continue to increase at a pretty rapid pace. 
On the retail side of the business, we kind of have 3 different businesses that we interact with. We have Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store. We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs, and customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day. 
Each 1 of those 3 businesses is growing significantly, really high rates faster than the rest of the business. But our Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store is growing at twice the rate of our ship to home and next-day delivery business. And that again shows us, once again, and remember, the way we price in the online world, if you do ship to home or next-day delivery, on most purchases, you can generally get a 20% discount. But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omnichannel provider. We've got to have great stores and great customer touch points. Convenience and knowledge that our AutoZoners provide to our customers is very valuable to our customers. So I hope I unpacked that okay for you."

But the heart of the question really is when we try to analyze this, we think it could be 100 bp-plus headwind to the P&L in isolation. But then we think there's a lot of levers you all have to pull to kind of mitigate. 
And 1 thing, for example, was COVID costs seem to be running above 100 bps. So is this a case where we should be kind of confident that you all can kind of mitigate some of these headwinds to the extent that this happens in a rational way? Just any color that you can share there on productivity initiatives, pricing power would be super helpful."
25307,704429875,2228093,"AutoZone, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2021",2021-03-02,"Earnings Calls","AutoZone, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is, we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things tha",314,"Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is, we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that we've been contemplating for a while. 
The first thing I'll say is that we've done a tremendous job inside of our operations, really driving productivity. And over time, what that's meant for us is that we have a highly productive workforce here that is delivering. And you can see that in this environment where we have accelerated sales growth, you're seeing us getting very decent leverage with our teams in the field. So that's one. 
The second thing is, the reality is that when there are inflationary pressures in the business, whether they're commodities or wages, you have to be disciplined as a company to make sure that you recover those. And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing. And we believe we're going to have that pricing power into the future. 
And then I think the third thing that stands out to me as it relates to minimum wages, we're going to do what's right for our AutoZoners. That's always been our philosophy inside the company. And so the cadence with which the legislation happens will have an impact on that. But across our business today, we're always focused on doing what's right for the AutoZoners and making sure that we're competitive in terms of acquiring labor. And so to the extent that there are changes that happen in the wage landscape, we're going to be competitive there, and we're going to have a business that enables us to be competitive in the future."

Okay. Well, good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.
Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides accompanying our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. 
To start off this morning, I'll spend some time talking about our sales results, trends over the 12 weeks, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. As I said in our press release this morning, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the heroic efforts of our store and supply chain AutoZoners. While classified as essential workers, essential seems insufficient to describe the remarkable contributions to our company, our customers and our results. Our AutoZoners have really stepped up during the pandemic and have been nothing short of exceptional, and our top priority remains being committed to providing all of our AutoZoners with a safe work environment to be sure -- so they can help our customers. 
While Jamere will talk more about this when he discusses the investments we've been making, I will say the additional emergency time-off or ETO we offered is something we just knew was the right thing to do for our AutoZoners. Thank you, AutoZoners again. 
Okay. Let's turn to our sales results. Our overall comp sales were up 15.2% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong this quarter with retail comps being slightly stronger than commercial. Commercial came on strong at the end of the quarter and comped similarly to retail for the last 4 weeks. 
Let's review our sales cadence. We told you on our last call, we ran an 8.8% comp for the last 4 weeks of Q1. In the first 4 weeks of this quarter, our sales accelerated to a 10.7% comp. As the holidays arrived, we saw further acceleration, which was sustained for the balance of the quarter. We ran a 17.5% comp pretty consistently over the last 8 weeks of the quarter. 
This quarter's traffic versus ticket growth was pretty close to split down the middle although ticket was slightly stronger. It was encouraging us for us to see sales inflect upwards starting in January, with both ticket and traffic moving higher. Our ticket growth was stronger this quarter due to hard part sales mixing higher than what we experienced in the first quarter. 
Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow all the national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs on the CDC guidelines. We continue to require masks entering our facilities, performed questionnaires of our team members and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing masks, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. And just last week, we announced that we would provide every AutoZoner with a $100 reward once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This is just the next logical step in our efforts to provide a safe, working and shopping environment. 
I continue to be inspired by our Board and our management team's commitment to doing what is right: putting safety first. You see, our values and our culture have been in full force and effect over the last year in this pandemic.
Addressing our supply chain, we've done a solid job with handling the extra demand, and our in-stock levels have continued to improve. To provide a little more color on industry drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further and further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits that ended last July. In the first week of January, over $100 billion of stimulus was distributed to Americans. The majority of these funds was for the onetime checks as part of the $600 billion stimulus package passed in late December. While smaller in size than the April disbursements, we did see our business pick up nicely, and our sales remained elevated throughout the remainder of the quarter. While we continue to be encouraged with the current selling environment, we feel any additional stimulus should lead to a strong sales environment.
During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country perform well with the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others pretty consistently. Again, these markets, which represent just over 25% of our store base, were solid but not as strong as the remaining markets. For example, the spread in comp sales between these markets and the others was approximately 300 basis points for the quarter. We believe the separation was due to lingering effects of a mild winter last year and colder weather happening later this winter. But winter did come this year. Boy, did it, and the performance gap closed. 
So we are encouraged about the summertime and believe we won't have to discuss why mild winter affected comp sales during our upcoming fourth quarter. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the mid-single-digit range with our sales closer to 3x the industry's growth rate. While we are thrilled to have these share gains now, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the spring and summer months.
I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about sales for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '21. I'll remind you that, typically, in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the third fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have a much more difficult comparison in the fourth fiscal quarter as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package. 
For now, it remains difficult for us to predict sales for the remainder of the year. This is especially true for the fourth quarter of this year when we were up against the fourth quarter of previous year's 21.8% comp store sales growth. While we continue to expect our sales growth will moderate over time, we believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. 
Over the long term, if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail, in particular, as it has in the last 3 recessions. Last quarter, we reminded you the strongest periods we'd experienced of outside sales growth over the last 3 decades have been the early '90s, '01 and '02, '09, '10 and '11, all coming out of recessionary environments. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. 
Interestingly, after each of those outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retained many of those customers in the years that followed.
Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 15.2% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $346 million, and our EPS was $14.93 a share, 20.5% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 16% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 15%. 
For commercial, we averaged over $53 million in weekly sales, which was over $10,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as the winter months are lower selling months for us. Moving forward, we remain very encouraged with what we are doing within our commercial business. The initiatives we have in place are helping our sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time.
While there were some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales force categories continue to be strong with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. In fact, our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This is the first quarter since the pandemic began where we saw our hard parts grow in line with sales floor.
While business improved in many merchandise categories, such as batteries, categories like brakes and rotors are not comping as high as the overall business. We believe this performance gap with certain categories will close as miles driven continue to improve. As for this year's winter, it was late arriving, but it did arrive. Overall, we view the winter as not having a material impact on our upcoming spring and summer business one way or the other.
We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects.
On last quarter's call, we announced we would be expensing additional payroll during the second quarter. The additional expense was to provide our AutoZoners with more emergency time-off. While this is the second time in our history we've offered ETO benefits, we believe it is the least we could do to support our AutoZoners in the field. This extra time-off award has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. Our AutoZoners have the right to use the benefits to address medical emergencies, take time off to get the vaccine, take additional paid vacation time-off or wait until the end of the calendar year and get paid what remains in their incremental vacation bank. In January, we paid out $31 million to AutoZoners who didn't utilize the ETO we offered them back in March of 2020. I have to tell you it was an honor to provide these AutoZoners with sizable checks in recognition of their heroic efforts. We feel this is a very important investment in our AutoZoners and in their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. 
Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

To s",2393,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $2.9 billion, up 16%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q2 last year. 
Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business. For the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 14.7% to $639 million. Sequentially, commercial growth was nearly 3 points higher than Q1. In the quarter, sales to our commercial customers represented 22% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $10,500, up 11.7%. We averaged $53 million in total weekly commercial sales. 
Internally, we have been executing against our commercial acceleration program where we are focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service, technology and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. 
This quarter, we opened 45 net new programs, finishing with 5,088 total programs. And our sales efficiency per store remained at near-record levels as we leveraged our DIY infrastructure and increased our share of wallet with existing customers. 
Let me be clear, our strategy is working. We believe we grew share and we remain focused on repeating this for the balance of fiscal 2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts, improvements in our assortment and parts covered by model year, more competitive pricing and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 3 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. And as we move forward, we are focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. 
First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability. We opened 1 more Mega-Hub this quarter, bringing our total to 48 locations, and we expect to open between 7 and 10 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. Given the success of our Mega-Hubs and increasing parts availability and driving meaningful sales lift, we're now raising our target from 75 to 90 Mega-Hubs at build-out to 100 to 110. These stores help us expand coverage and say, yes, we have it more frequently. 
Second, we are leveraging technology to improve delivery times and service levels. The technology investments we're making in electronic ordering and tracking will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. We're making it simpler to do business with AutoZone, and we're driving efficiency for our sales professionals and drivers. 
Third, we are committed to being price competitive. We have a laser focus on the key categories where investment and pricing lead to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. We like the competitive hand that we have in our commercial business and believe we are in the early innings of a transformational growth story.
Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our retail acceleration initiatives. We're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY share growth. Like the commercial initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are running an intense playbook in DIY that is driving solid results for our business. First, the assortment work and Mega-Hub strategy that I mentioned earlier drive tremendous benefits to our DIY business. Our investments are improving coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful impact on trial and repeat purchase activity. 
Second, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with the work we have done on the digital front. Our efforts in Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home have helped us meet customers when, where and how they want to shop. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the customer experience and make it easier to shop our broad array of products. 
Third and similar to our commercial approach, we have a laser-like focus on being competitively priced in the marketplace. We're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to drive pricing decisions in certain categories, categories where we typically compete with nontraditional competitors like mass and online-only sellers in commodities and very slow-moving parts and products. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. This is a data-rich environment, and our tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. Again, we're living up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, and we believe it is helping us create a faster-growing business. 
Fourth, we simply have a relentless focus on execution. As Bill mentioned, our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have delivered exceptional results in a tough environment. As I said last quarter, perhaps the best investment we have made in our company is the investment in additional emergency time-off. In return, we continue to see our supply chain process record volume and our store AutoZoners handle record store traffic while still delighting our customers. This focus on execution is a meaningful competitive advantage for us, and we're winning in the marketplace. 
Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. First, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores to finish with 628 stores, and our store sales accelerated sequentially. Like last quarter, the exchange rate again played a role in the U.S. dollar equivalent reported sales. The exchange rate finished the quarter at roughly [ 77% ] higher than last year's second quarter rate. That's 7% higher than last quarter's second rate. And as a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we're seeing signs of a turnaround in the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. 
Regarding Brazil, we opened 1 new store to finish with 46 stores this quarter. The Brazilian real continues to face headwinds and devalued roughly 25% for Q2 over last year. Long term, Brazil will be an important market for AutoZone, and we will invest in a disciplined way. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 77 basis points. 37 basis points of margin headwind is due to higher supply chain costs, including a onetime benefit last year that did not repeat this year. The remaining 40 basis points came from our pricing initiatives, loyalty program and mix shift. As I discussed above, we're focused on competitive pricing that will drive top line and gross profit dollar gains. 
To be clear, though, the industry's pricing remains rational, and overall, we still have pricing power. We have tested certain categories and taken action when we have the ability to drive both top line and gross profit dollar gains. This is a dynamic market, and we remain disciplined in our approach. The strategy is working. We see our work translating into higher sales and profits, as evidenced by the transaction and share growth that Bill mentioned earlier. As we continue to refine our strategy over the next several quarters, we're planning for higher sales and gross profit dollars that outpace the drag from gross margin rate. This is a good outcome for our business as we're driving new customers and retention. 
All of the investments we are making suggest that we're growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. Again, our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Regarding operating expenses, our teams, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses are up 12.5% versus last year's Q2. But included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $40 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses, which represented 4.2% of the overall SG&A growth. We believe our decision to provide emergency time-off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic was absolutely the right thing to do. As I said last quarter, this is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $482 million, up 18.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the last fiscal year's third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $46 million to $47 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $47.5 million in last year's third quarter. 
Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion versus last year's Q2 ending balance of just under $5.5 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And long term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
Moving to tax, our tax rate was 20.6% versus 17.7% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 265 basis points from stock options exercise. While last year, it benefited 412 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $346 million, up 15.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.2 million was lower by 4.1% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.93, up 20.5% over the prior year second quarter.
Let me talk a few minutes about our cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $356 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $150 million over last year's Q2. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter versus $315 million last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2x. 
Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remained significantly higher than historical levels. We now have $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which approximately $830 million is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong. 
We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per-store growth was flat versus Q2 last year. Inventory per store was $715,000 versus $713,000 last year and $702,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 2.8% over the same period last year driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-location basis, was a negative $93,000 versus negative $41,000 last year and negative $99,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113% versus last year's Q2 of 105.7%. 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we restarted our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock, and based on our view of the future, began methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again, but we feel comfortable with our strategy and our execution. As I mentioned, we spent $900 million on stock repurchases, representing 752,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans, and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. This will enable us to grow our business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. 
So to wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and this gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. 
And now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Your grasp of the fundamentals of this business in less than 6 months is extraordinary, and thank you for being here. We're so glad you joined the team. 
These continue to be unique and extraordinary times, and they continue to require us to look at many things differently while managing our business day to day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. They've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far, but we must stay focused, and we must continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate and we must continue to execute. 
Our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well. We understand trends will slow in the future. We're going to work. We're going to work as hard as possible to gain as much share as possible and limit our headwinds, and we continue to see a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. Our business continues to do very well, and we are still in the early innings of growth. But as always, we have work to do as we head into our spring selling season. 
First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and our customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. 
Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. 
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

As you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades. We found some particular specific opportunities where we found places to invest and improve our value proposition to our customers. They're very specific pieces, both in the retail business and the commercial business.
I don't know exactly what's going to happen a year from now. Our team is going to continue to innovate. We are constantly raising prices, and we are constantly lowering prices, trying to find that sweet spot where our customers value -- the value that they're getting the best. So I don't know exactly what it's going to be over the long term.
But if you recap what Jamere said, the gross margin, we had about 40 basis points, which was a onetime negative from last year. So all the things that were embedded in there, of which price was one of them, accumulated to 40 basis points. Frankly, I'm not that smart to know what the gross margin is going to be within 40 basis points 2 or 3 years from now."

We talked, I guess, probably 3 years ago that we were embarking on a new commercial study, and we developed a new strategy that we began rolling out probably 18 months or so ago. And we're still in the early innings of rolling out that strategy. It has many different elements. I mean this Hub and Mega-Hub portion of the strategy, which is taking years, but it is making a meaningful difference, a very meaningful difference in our ability to say yes to our customers. And it's leaning towards commercial, although it's helping DIY tremendously as well. That's an element of it.
We've rolled out new technology in our commercial business, handheld technology, which allows us to be able to better understand what our delivery times are and manage our delivery times better. We're significantly already reduced our delivery times in the last 6 months, and we think we have more room to go. We've also enhanced our website and our ability to communicate and be easy to do business with, with our commercial customers. So I don't think it's -- and then, of course, the ongoing evolution and building of the Duralast brand. 
So it's not one individual issue. It's an amalgamation of all these different issues coming together and improving our competitive position. Not to mention, during the global pandemic and the stay-at-home and safe-at-home orders, we were there for our customers every day. And that allowed us to introduce ourselves at a different level to some customers, and I think that has resulted in stickier long-term relationships."

So all of the metrics point to the fact that the strategy is working.
What we're not seeing is we're not seeing a ton of cost pressures that are material, and the industry pricing remains rational. So what we're doing as part of this strategy is very surgical. In other words, we're not peanut-butter-spreading price declines across the business, but we're being very surgical, using very sophisticated data and analytics. And those are the things that give us a lot of confidence that what we're doing makes a lot of sense for the consumer and makes a lot of sense for us. So as we move forward, we're going to continue to lean into this strategy. And our approach is delivered in the marketplace.

We have really good data on the retail share gains. We don't have as good a data, but we can look at headline growth numbers in the commercial gains.
On retail, we are picking up a lot of share from what's traditionally, we believe, in the mass channel. I think a lot of people are not frequenting those large stores at the same rate that they did in the past. And what we're focused on is making sure, as we're getting those incremental visits, that we are going above and beyond, so we get those visits in the future.
I think also, as this brick-and-mortar omnichannel strategy comes to place, I think we're also not losing share that we might have been losing before to the online channel, and in fact, maybe gaining some of that share back over time. 
In the commercial sector, I think it's hard to say where the share is coming from. We are less than 4% market share in the commercial industry today. I think it's likely coming from probably multiple different places. We certainly have intensified our understanding of what the wholesale distributor market is doing, and we're paying more attention to them and our competitive analysis and building our strategy. And we think that over time, we've significantly changed our competitive position, particularly against the WDs. You think about what we've done with assortment, what we've done building a sales force. Now we've got this technology that we have in place, which is going to improve our deliveries, I think that our competitive positioning in the marketplace is vastly different than what it was 4, 5 years ago."

We had trouble with tools. I mean we just had such enormous surges in certain parts of our business that we couldn't keep up, and many of those came with an extended supply chain that ran into China or Asia.
We've worked through most of those. I have to give our team and our battery suppliers some kudos that the battery business has been as strong as it's been for as long as it's been. And then we had this huge, cold surge or cold snap, and we did just fine. Our team was very creative and worked with lots of different suppliers to make sure we were in good shape. So we don't have any acute needs right now. Some issues on the edges. Our in-stock position has significantly improved, but it's not back to our normal levels yet, probably going to take a few more months."

I'm not sure how to answer it all. Clearly, I think we talked that we were worried. If anything, we might have pulled forward some battery business because those cars parked last spring, and they sat for 5 or 6 weeks. As soon as the safer-at-home orders went away, our battery business boomed. But that battery business has sustained really high levels ever since. We've seen no dip in our battery business. We've seen weeks where we're going up against tough winter weather where it might be softer. But overall, it has exceeded our expectations over the last 11 months.
As far as sustainability of these sales surges, the thing that keeps resonating with me is if you think about our business over really long periods of time, when our customers have incremental time, and specifically, incremental money, our business outperforms normal periods of time. And it's been that way for the last decade when we get tax refunds. How much have we talked in this environment about the surge we see during tax refund season, which is just beginning right now? We've seen it every single year. And when tax refunds moved back 3 weeks, we had to spend a lot of time talking about it because it moved out of 1 quarter into another quarter.
It's just evidence that when our customer, who I often term is financially fragile, when they get some incremental dollars, we seem to get a disproportionate share of those funds. And we saw it again in January when the stimulus came out. It wasn't nearly the stimulus that we saw last April. But within a day, we saw that those funds showing up in significantly improved business for us. And that sustained itself through the end of the quarter.
Now we're talking about another stimulus, which could -- frankly can dwarf what happened last April. If that comes, what does that mean to our business? All the indications we have is it would be very strong for our business because each time we've seen those incremental dollars, our business has performed better than normal."

I don't think the stimulus plays nearly as much in the commercial business as it does the DIY business. And I think most of the end consumers in the commercial business are higher socioeconomic -- higher up on the socioeconomic ladder. So that incremental money doesn't mean as much to them. Both businesses were doing really well. Commercial is continuing to rebound. 
But there are still elements of the commercial business that aren't as strong as they were pre-pandemic, particularly some of our national account players, the up-and-down-the-street business has been stronger than the national account business. And again, I think that, that has to do with the end consumer that is servicing or picking the UDS business versus picking the national account business."

First of all, we believe there's going to be a market, and AutoZone is going to be a big player, just as we are today with the internal combustion engine. Our strategy is simple. We're just going to follow the consumer, just like we've done in the past. We're not wed to internal combustion engine technology. We've significantly changed our assortment over time to reflect the latest technology, so this is not an accidental threat for us. We're operating from a position of strength.
If you think about our business today, we're already supplying parts and supplies to the EV market, things like wiper blades. We have world-class capabilities in supply chain and merchandising. We have great relationships and partnerships with the OEMs who have a seat at the table today and can help us forecast the volumes and the timing of the market changes, and we have this tremendous retail footprint and commercial business that gives us distribution points. 
So as we think about the parts and supplies that are at risk with electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, there will be offsets. I mean there will be -- clearly, there'll be some things that are at risk, but there will be offsets to those. And there'll be opportunities for us in both DIY and DIFM.
So listen, despite what we see in headlines and announcements from the OEMs, we're a bit cautious because the market has some near-term challenges that we're watching closely. First of all, consumer adoption is uncertain, roughly 2% of the market today, and it's growing slowly. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, the charging infrastructure is not ready for prime time. The rapid charging stations need to be built out. It's going to be expensive. It's probably going to take some combination of public and private partnerships. The business model there has an uncertain path to profitability. And quite frankly, we think there's going to be some need for some pretty significant power grid investments. But we do believe there's going to be a market, and we're going to be a player, and we're simply going to follow the consumer."

We've also talked about our maintenance products not being at the same levels that we're experiencing the rest of our business, things like brakes and rotors and the like.

Used to, if somebody said Bill, and it was a hard question, I would just look at Giles and let him answer it. But you put it on me this time. 
So let's talk about our digital business. In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where customers really picking a channel. They're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are 2 primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buttons, and we fulfill it the exact same way, regardless of how they initially interact with us. We've been doing a lot of work trying to make -- doing it digitally with us easier, and we've made significant strides. Really proud of the team that's been doing that work over the last couple of years, in particular. 
And we've also made a lot of other back-office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone. We believe and hope, over time, that our percentage of digital penetration in the commercial business will continue to increase at a pretty rapid pace. 
On the retail side of the business, we kind of have 3 different businesses that we interact with. We have Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store. We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center; or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs. And customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day. 
Each 1 of those 3 businesses is growing significantly, really high rates faster than the rest of the business. But our Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store is growing at twice the rate of our ship to home and next-day delivery business. And that, again, shows us, once again, and remember, the way we price in the online world, if you do ship to home or next-day delivery, on most purchases, you can generally get a 20% discount. But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omnichannel provider. We've got to have great stores and great customer touch points. Convenience and knowledge that our AutoZoners provide to our customers is very valuable to our customers. So I hope I unpacked that okay for you."

And one thing, for example, was COVID costs seem to be running above 100 bps. So is this a case where we should be kind of confident that you all can kind of mitigate some of these headwinds to the extent that this happens in a rational way?

One is we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that",314,"Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that we've been contemplating for a while. 
The first thing I'll say is that we've done a tremendous job inside of our operations, really driving productivity. And over time, what that's meant for us is that we have a highly productive workforce here that is delivering. And you can see that in this environment where we have accelerated sales growth, you're seeing us getting very decent leverage with our teams in the field. So that's one. 
The second thing is the reality is that when there are inflationary pressures in the business, whether they're commodities or wages, you have to be disciplined as a company to make sure that you recover those. And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing, and we believe we're going to have that pricing power into the future. 
And then I think the third thing that stands out to me as it relates to minimum wages, we're going to do what's right for our AutoZoners. That's always been our philosophy inside the company, and so the cadence with which the legislation happens will have an impact on that. But across our business today, we're always focused on doing what's right for the AutoZoners and making sure that we're competitive in terms of acquiring labor. And so to the extent that there are changes that happen in the wage landscape, we're going to be competitive there, and we're going to have a business that enables us to be competitive in the future."

Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. 
I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they have taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all. I also want to reiterate our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners again. 
Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercial's growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses but especially for commercial. We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing 4 quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial, and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes. 
Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter stretched from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first 4 weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the central and southeastern states. Sales picked up for the next 4 weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final 4 weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these 4 weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those 4 weeks, we averaged a 14% comp, with the last 2 weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. 
We continue to maintain solid growth rates post stimulus. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 27.9%. On a 2-year stacked basis, the first 4 weeks were up 17.9%, the next 4 weeks were up an impressive 49.9% and the last 4 weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate as the reintroduction of federal stimulus payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic. 
During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country performed consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others. No, not this quarter. These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and DIFM. And we believe the winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall. 
And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The share data we have available for the first 8 weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. 
Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter's call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with a $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts. We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. 
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales, and sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us. However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year, and we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. 
I'm sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July, and we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. 
While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. 
Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $596 million and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter. Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. 
For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. 
Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and formats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up, and our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items. 
We believe the strengthening of our hard parts business is due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories such as accessories and batteries. Notably, brakes and rotors, while still slightly below our average growth had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather. 
As we expect, our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. We believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses position us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter.

As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering, and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 31.8%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year. 
Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2% as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. 
Our growth was broad-based as national accounts and local and regional accounts both grew over 40% in the quarter. Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I have said previously, we're focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. 
This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs, finishing with 5,107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. Our strategy is working as we continue to grow share this past quarter. We are confident that we can continue to gain share as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, make improvements in our assortment, maintain competitive pricing and stay committed to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 4 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. 
As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened 2 more Mega-Hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations, and we expect to open between 4 and 7 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. As you might recall from last quarter's conference call, we raised our near-term targeted build-out of Mega-Hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega-Hubs help us expand coverage and say, Yes, We Have It! more frequently. Expanding our Mega-Hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. 
Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. 
Third, we're committed to being price competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results. We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. 
On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based across regions and categories. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in 8 of the 12 weeks, and all 12 weeks had positive comps despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share, as measured by NPD, grew nearly 2 points for the first 8 weeks of the quarter. And we saw double-digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter. 
We also grew share in April despite the tremendous growth last year, signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas: first, the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes, and our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear, we are winning in the marketplace, and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers is a key competitive advantage. 
Second, the assortment work and Mega-Hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful lift in sales. Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts: Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home, which were up again significantly this quarter, have helped us meet customers win, where and how they want to shop. We're particularly pleased with Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, the fastest-growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure-play competitors. 
Fourth and similar to our commercial approach, we're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively priced. This is a data-rich environment and our data-driven approach, tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working, and we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. 
DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lap the accelerated sales growth that we have seen over the past 4 quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. 
Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores and 1 new store in Brazil to finish with 47. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future. I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and our investment in our pricing initiatives. As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter, and we're also making disciplined pricing investments to drive top line growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpaced the remaining market this quarter. Our approach is disciplined and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determined which actions move the sales and grow profit dollar performance in the right direction. 
We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry's pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business, and as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter. We will continue to drive new customers and, over time, grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster-than-historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses compared to last year's third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time-off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $804 million, up 63% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million, down 5% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
Moving to tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately, our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million, up 73.9% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lower by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. 
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2% 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year, combined with excess cash carry over from last year, has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
We remain confident in our near-term plans, and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. Our business remains remarkably strong, and this will enable us to invest in our existing assets, grow our business and, as I emphasized earlier, returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach. 
So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this time frame. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers but doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter 30 years after going public is just amazing. 
But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment. We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn, but we will be deliberate. We understand the value of the capital invested. As our capital is our investors' capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. 
But we must keep focus and continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate. While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard, to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds. Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. 
And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial business is still in the very early innings of the maturation process. It is an honor to have reported this morning that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing 4-quarter basis. But we hope and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. 
As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season, but we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in 3 to 5 years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value. 
And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that all of the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just 1 element of it, and I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold. Those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with, that's helping us lower our delivery times is a significant impact on the business. 
The work that we're doing around Mega-Hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth. And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market."

Simeon, thank you for the question. Clearly, they're on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on 2 different spectrums of the business: one, on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments; and then two, on very slow-moving hard-to-find parts where maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is when you can walk in the store and get immediate product availability. 
The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today. And we've done that work and it's all in place. And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive because we took prices to a different level. We continued to roll out the pricing initiatives that were working. We originally started with 6 regions, then we went to 14 regions. As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. 
We don't plan on having a round 2 of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different. When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition against other sectors of the industry."

And we do have the ability, as we move forward, to continue to price in a very disciplined way. 
When we're in an environment where there's inflation, quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price and we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. So going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars. That's going to give us the tremendously powerful free cash flow. 
And you can tweak margins by 1 point or 1.5 points, doesn't change the underlying story here, which is this is a business that is generating a tremendous amount of cash. And we're putting that to work by investing in our existing assets. We're investing in our growth initiatives, and we're returning meaningful amounts of cash to investors in a meaningful way. That portion of the AutoZone model does not change even with all the things that we've talked about this morning in terms of investments."

In any given quarter prior to the pandemic, AutoZone would regularly see an average of $70 million in year-over-year sales increases. So now you're having to invest almost half that amount to drive these share gains. 
How did you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors?

Your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right, and that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time is clearly, there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about picking up the gross profit dollars. But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this. We've tested it extensively for over a year. 
Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial -- our close-end competitors may follow us. They may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition. It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close-in competitors. We feel like we are doing exceptionally well with that. 
I think also I want to go back to what Jamere said. This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over 3 years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website, all making us much easier to do business with and substantially lowering our delivery times. 
We continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. People used to think that, that was a headwind. Now people understand that it is a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out Hubs and Mega-Hubs where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products. So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. 
And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics but the overall operating margin characteristics. And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough to remember in 2005 when I came into this role and we made an SG&A investment, everybody said, ""Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A -- the beginning of the operating margins going from [ 17.5 ] down to [ 12 ]. Well, what happened?"" Over time, we had found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that will happen from here, but these are very marginal investments to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels."

On the transportation costs, in particular, we've had some contracted rates that are below the spot market, so this has protected us to some extent. But we'll see more of those as we move forward. From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. 
We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think, gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage. Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment. And as we also believe that from a macro standpoint, as some of the enhanced unemployment benefits start to ease and be retracted, we think that will sort of unstick the labor market to a certain extent.

So we have big expectations to continue to grow commercial at fairly robust rates going forward. 
Clearly, the DIY piece will be more challenged as we head into Q4 and really frankly, the next 12 months. But commercial, we think, is a much stickier business. Yes, we picked up new customers. More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business. 
As Jamere said, as far as the trade-off between the up and down the street customer or the national account customer, before this quarter, our up and down the street business was performing much better than our national account business. This quarter, the national account business was generally in line with our up and down the street business. And as we talk to those leaders, their businesses have improved along the same lines."

And that gives us a meaningful lift in sales. 
So a big piece of that strategy that we've talked about is improving that assortment, putting Mega-Hubs in the marketplace, signaling to the market that we have more parts available in the marketplace and then taking advantage of that opportunity. We've talked about lots of things that drive our commercial business, but in the top 1 or 2 is parts availability. If we have the parts, if we can get them there in a reasonable amount of time, they're competitively priced. We're easy to do business with.

As we were before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%. I think it was 49.9%. 
And then we came out the other side. And on a 2-year basis, we were still up [ 26 7 ] in those last 4 weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last 4 weeks this year, were 14%, with the last 2 weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. So what we have seen is that stimulus -- the stimulus dollars that came in March, they stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected. 
Similar to what happened last summer. If you remember, our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year. So clearly, that will be a headwind as we look in Q4 but not completely. Does that help?"

And you'll see a significant amount of Mega-Hubs come online this quarter and over the next year. So I think that, that will help us in a big way. 
As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago. It's still that way today. If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers. I also talked about all this technology that we've rolled out. And we're still in the very early innings of that. We've seen reductions in our delivery times, but we are looking for significantly bigger, larger reductions in delivery times as this technology matures, as our team understands how to utilize it and how to change getting parts and products, frankly, out of the building is our biggest focus, not necessarily the drive time.

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. 
Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. 
I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they have taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all. I also want to reiterate our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners again. 
Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercial's growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses but especially for commercial. We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing 4 quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial, and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes. 
Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter stretched from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first 4 weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the central and southeastern states. Sales picked up for the next 4 weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final 4 weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these 4 weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those 4 weeks, we averaged a 14% comp, with the last 2 weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. 
We continue to maintain solid growth rates post stimulus. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 27.9%. On a 2-year stacked basis, the first 4 weeks were up 17.9%, the next 4 weeks were up an impressive 49.9% and the last 4 weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate as the reintroduction of federal stimulus payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic. 
During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country performed consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others. No, not this quarter. These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and DIFM. And we believe the winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall. 
And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The share data we have available for the first 8 weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. 
Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter's call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with a $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts. We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. 
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales, and sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us. However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year, and we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. 
I'm sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July, and we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. 
While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. 
Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $596 million and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter. Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. 
For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. 
Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and formats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up, and our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items. 
We believe the strengthening of our hard parts business is due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories such as accessories and batteries. Notably, brakes and rotors, while still slightly below our average growth had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather. 
As we expect, our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. We believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses position us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering, and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 31.8%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year. 
Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2% as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. 
Our growth was broad-based as national accounts and local and regional accounts both grew over 40% in the quarter. Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I have said previously, we're focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. 
This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs, finishing with 5,107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. Our strategy is working as we continue to grow share this past quarter. We are confident that we can continue to gain share as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, make improvements in our assortment, maintain competitive pricing and stay committed to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 4 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. 
As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened 2 more Mega-Hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations, and we expect to open between 4 and 7 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. As you might recall from last quarter's conference call, we raised our near-term targeted build-out of Mega-Hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega-Hubs help us expand coverage and say, Yes, We Have It! more frequently. Expanding our Mega-Hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. 
Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. 
Third, we're committed to being price competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results. We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. 
On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based across regions and categories. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in 8 of the 12 weeks, and all 12 weeks had positive comps despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share, as measured by NPD, grew nearly 2 points for the first 8 weeks of the quarter. And we saw double-digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter. 
We also grew share in April despite the tremendous growth last year, signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas: first, the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes, and our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear, we are winning in the marketplace, and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers is a key competitive advantage. 
Second, the assortment work and Mega-Hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful lift in sales. Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts: Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home, which were up again significantly this quarter, have helped us meet customers win, where and how they want to shop. We're particularly pleased with Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, the fastest-growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure-play competitors. 
Fourth and similar to our commercial approach, we're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively priced. This is a data-rich environment and our data-driven approach, tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working, and we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. 
DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lap the accelerated sales growth that we have seen over the past 4 quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. 
Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores and 1 new store in Brazil to finish with 47. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future. I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and our investment in our pricing initiatives. As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter, and we're also making disciplined pricing investments to drive top line growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpaced the remaining market this quarter. Our approach is disciplined and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determined which actions move the sales and grow profit dollar performance in the right direction. 
We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry's pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business, and as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter. We will continue to drive new customers and, over time, grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster-than-historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses compared to last year's third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time-off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $804 million, up 63% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million, down 5% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
Moving to tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately, our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million, up 73.9% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lower by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. 
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2% 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year, combined with excess cash carry over from last year, has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
We remain confident in our near-term plans, and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. Our business remains remarkably strong, and this will enable us to invest in our existing assets, grow our business and, as I emphasized earlier, returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach. 
So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this time frame. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers but doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter 30 years after going public is just amazing. 
But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment. We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn, but we will be deliberate. We understand the value of the capital invested. As our capital is our investors' capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. 
But we must keep focus and continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate. While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard, to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds. Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. 
And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial business is still in the very early innings of the maturation process. It is an honor to have reported this morning that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing 4-quarter basis. But we hope and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. 
As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season, but we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in 3 to 5 years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

What I'll say in general is that we've been very disciplined about the investments that we've been making in pricing. As I mentioned, this is a very data-rich environment. We're using data-driven tools. We're using artificial intelligence and data science to help us figure out exactly where to price, which categories to price, which regions to price. So it's a very dynamic environment in that regard. 
We're fortunate that we don't have to peanut butter spread this across the chain, if you will. So what we're doing is very surgical and very strategic. What I'll say in terms of the competitive response is that the industry remains very rational. We're seeing rational pricing across the industry, and the response to that extent has been pretty muted. So our strategy is working. Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value. 
And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that all of the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just 1 element of it, and I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold. Those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with, that's helping us lower our delivery times is a significant impact on the business. 
The work that we're doing around Mega-Hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth. And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market."

Simeon, thank you for the question. Clearly, they're on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on 2 different spectrums of the business: one, on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments; and then two, on very slow-moving hard-to-find parts where maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is when you can walk in the store and get immediate product availability. 
The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today. And we've done that work and it's all in place. And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive because we took prices to a different level. We continued to roll out the pricing initiatives that were working. We originally started with 6 regions, then we went to 14 regions. As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. 
We don't plan on having a round 2 of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different. When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition against other sectors of the industry."

And we do have the ability, as we move forward, to continue to price in a very disciplined way. 
When we're in an environment where there's inflation, quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price and we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. So going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars.

How did you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors?

Your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right, and that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time is clearly, there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about picking up the gross profit dollars. But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this. We've tested it extensively for over a year. 
Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial -- our close-end competitors may follow us. They may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition. It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close-in competitors. We feel like we are doing exceptionally well with that. 
I think also I want to go back to what Jamere said. This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over 3 years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website, all making us much easier to do business with and substantially lowering our delivery times. 
We continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. People used to think that, that was a headwind. Now people understand that it is a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out Hubs and Mega-Hubs where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products. So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. 
And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics but the overall operating margin characteristics. And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough to remember in 2005 when I came into this role and we made an SG&A investment, everybody said, ""Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A -- the beginning of the operating margins going from [ 17.5 ] down to [ 12 ]. Well, what happened?"" Over time, we had found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that will happen from here, but these are very marginal investments to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels."

Miles driven is improving. 
And we're underpenetrated. We think we're roughly a [ 4 to 5 ] share in a $75 billion category, so there's a tremendous opportunity to create a faster-growing business here. And as we execute on this growth playbook and see significant share gains, we will likely be in a position where we see a little bit of a mixed drag from commercial on the overall margins. And that's going to be perfectly okay. This will be a faster-growing and still high-margin business as we move forward.

We're also seeing some higher transportation costs. But as I said before, the industry pricing is rational. And this has always been an industry that's priced to recover those inflationary impacts, and we're pricing accordingly in this environment as well. 
On the transportation costs, in particular, we've had some contracted rates that are below the spot market, so this has protected us to some extent. But we'll see more of those as we move forward. From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. 
We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think, gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage. Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment. And as we also believe that from a macro standpoint, as some of the enhanced unemployment benefits start to ease and be retracted, we think that will sort of unstick the labor market to a certain extent. But all the efforts that we're doing inside of our company to attract talent is, quite frankly, one of the reasons that we've been able to put up the kind of numbers that we put up in both our DIY and our commercial business."

Clearly, if you just straight-line what happens to miles driven, you would have never forecast what happened to us over the last year because miles driven were down significantly. 
But there was a new element called federal stimulus. And we were talking this morning, a family of 4 over the last 4 years -- the last 4 quarters has picked up over $10,000 in federal stimulus. That does not count unemployed -- enhanced unemployment benefits. That is just the stimulus. For our customer, that's a tremendous amount of money. And many of those customers turn to their automobiles and enhance them, repair them or whatever the case may be. Clearly, as miles driven return, there will be some small tailwind but I don't think that it will be nearly enough to offset the headwind that will come from us lapping those tremendous amounts of economic stimulus that were in the environment."

More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business. 
As Jamere said, as far as the trade-off between the up and down the street customer or the national account customer, before this quarter, our up and down the street business was performing much better than our national account business.

Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. 
I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head-on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they have taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all. I also want to reiterate our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners, again. 
Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercial's growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses but especially for commercial. We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing 4 quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial. And we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes. 
Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter stretched from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first 4 weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the Central and Southeastern states. Sales picked up for the next 4 weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final 4 weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these 4 weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those 4 weeks, we averaged a 14% comp with the last 2 weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. 
We continue to maintain solid growth rates post stimulus. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 27.9%. On a 2-year stacked basis, the first 4 weeks were up 17.9%, the next 4 weeks were up an impressive 49.9% and the last 4 weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate as the reintroduction of federal stimulus payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic. 
During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw majority of the country perform consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others. No, not this quarter. These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and DIFM. And we believe the winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall. 
And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The share data we have available for the first 8 weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. 
Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter's call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with a $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts. We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. 
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales. And sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us. However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year. And we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. 
Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter. But we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July. And we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY, as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. 
Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter, our net income was $596 million and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter. Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. 
For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market. And we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. 
Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. And our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items. We believe this strengthening of our hard parts business is due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. 
Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories, such as accessories and batteries. Notably, brakes and rotors, while still slightly below our average growth, had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather. As we expect our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time, we believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses position us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. 
Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 31.8%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year. 
Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2%, as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. Our growth was broad-based as national accounts and local and regional accounts both grew over 40% in the quarter. 
Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I have said previously, we're focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores. And we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. 
This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs, finishing with 5,107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. Our strategy is working as we continued to grow share this past quarter. We are confident that we can continue to gain share as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand; make improvements in our assortment; maintain competitive pricing; and stay committed to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 4 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. 
As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened 2 more Mega-Hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations, and we expect to open between 4 and 7 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. As you might recall from last quarter's conference call, we raised our near-term targeted build-out of Mega-Hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega-Hubs help us expand coverage and say, Yes, We Have It! more frequently. Expanding our Mega-Hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. 
Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and Mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. 
Third, we're committed to being price-competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results. We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. 
On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based across regions and categories. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit comps in 8 of the 12 weeks. And all 12 weeks had positive comps despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share, as measured by NPD, grew nearly 2 points for the first 8 weeks of the quarter. And we saw double-digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter. We also grew share in April despite the tremendous growth last year, signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. 
Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas. First, a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes and our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear, we are winning in the marketplace. And the execution of our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, is a key competitive advantage. Second, the assortment work and Mega-Hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful lift in sales. 
Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts. Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home, which were up again significantly this quarter, have helped us meet customers win, where and how they want to shop. We're particularly pleased with Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, the fastest-growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in-store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure-play competitors. 
Fourth, and similar to our commercial approach, we're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively priced. This is a data-rich environment, and our data-driven approach, tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working, and we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. 
DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lap the accelerated sales growth that we have seen over the past 4 quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. 
Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores and 1 new store in Brazil to finish with 47. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future. I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and our investment in our pricing initiatives. As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter, and we're also making disciplined pricing investments to drive top line growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpaced the remaining market this quarter. Our approach is disciplined and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determined which actions move the sales and gross profit dollar performance in the right direction. 
We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry's pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business. And as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter. We will continue to drive new customers and over time, grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster-than-historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter's expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses compared to last year's third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time-off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $804 million, up 63% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million, down 5% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. 
Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. 
Moving to tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable. And as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million, up 73.9% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lower by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. 
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2%. 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year, combined with excess cash carried over from last year, has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first 3 quarters of the year. 
We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. Our business remains remarkably strong. And this will enable us to invest in our existing assets, grow our business and, as I emphasized earlier, returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach. 
So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this time frame. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers but doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter 30 years after going public is just amazing. 
But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment. We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn. But we will be deliberate. We understand the value of the capital invested. As our capital is our investors' capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. 
But we must keep focus and continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate. While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard, to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds. Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions, where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial business is still in the very early innings of a maturation process. It is an honor to have reported this morning that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing 4-quarter basis. But we hope and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. 
As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season. But we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in 3 to 5 years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company.

So what we're doing is very surgical and very strategic. What I'll say in terms of the competitive response is that the industry remains very rational. We're seeing rational pricing across the industry. And the response to that extent has been pretty muted. So our strategy is working. Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately shareholder value. 
And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that all of the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just one element of it -- and I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand, including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold. Those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with that's helping us lower our delivery times is a significant impact on the business. 
The work that we're doing around Mega-Hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth. And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market."

Simeon, thank you for the question. Clearly, they're on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on two different spectrums of the business: one, on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments; and then two, on very slow-moving, hard-to-find parts, where maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is when you can walk in the store and get immediate product availability. The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today. And we've done that work and it's all in place. 
And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive because we took prices to a different level. We continued to roll out the pricing initiatives that were working. We originally started with 6 regions, then we went to 14 regions. As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. We don't plan on having a round 2 of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. 
As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different. When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition against other sectors of the industry."

Number one, we've had outstanding leverage on the SG&A line, which quite frankly has served as a little bit of a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making in gross margin. And we do have the ability, as we move forward, to continue to price in a very disciplined way. When we're in an environment where there's inflation. Quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price and we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. 
So going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars. That's going to give us a tremendously powerful free cash flow. And you can tweak margins by 1 point or 1.5 points, doesn't change the underlying story here, which is this is a business that is generating a tremendous amount of cash. And we're putting that to work by investing in our existing assets. We're investing in our growth initiatives. And we're returning meaningful amounts of cash to investors in a meaningful way. That portion of the AutoZone model does not change even with all the things that we've talked about this morning in terms of investments."

So now you're having to invest almost half that amount to drive these share gains. How did you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors?

Your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right. And that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time is clearly there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about picking up the gross profit dollars. But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this. We've tested it extensively for over a year. Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial -- our close-in competitors may follow us, they may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition. It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close-in competitors. We feel like we are doing exceptionally well with that. 
I think also I want to go back to what Jamere said. This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over 3 years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website, all making us much easier to do business with and substantially lowering our delivery times. We've continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. And people used to think that, that was a headwind. Now people understand that it is a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out Hubs and Mega-Hubs, where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products. So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. 
And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics but the overall operating margin characteristics. And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough to remember in 2005, when I came into this role and we made an SG&A investment, everybody said, ""Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A -- or the beginning of the operating margins going from 17.5% down to 12%."" Well, what happened? Over time, we had found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that will happen from here, but these are very marginal investments to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels."

From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. 
We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think, gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage. Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment.

So we have big expectations to continue to grow commercial at fairly robust rates going forward. Clearly, the DIY piece will be more challenged as we head into Q4 and really frankly, the next 12 months. But commercial, we think, is a much stickier business. 
Yes, we picked up new customers. More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business. As Jamere said, as far as the tradeoff between the up-and-down-the-street customer or the national account customer, before this quarter, our up-and-down-the-street business was performing much better than our national account business. This quarter, the national account business was generally in line with our up-and-down-the-street business. And as we talk to those leaders, their businesses have improved along the same lines."

Number one, we see a lift in sales in the four walls, if you will, of the Mega-Hub.

And that gives us a meaningful lift in sales. 
So a big piece of that strategy that we've talked about is improving that assortment, putting Mega-Hubs in the marketplace, signaling to the market that we have more parts available in the marketplace and then taking advantage of that opportunity. We've talked about lots of things that drive our commercial business. But in the top 1 or 2 is parts availability. If we have the parts, if we can get them there in a reasonable amount of time, they're competitively priced, we're easy to do business with, that gives us a tremendous tailwind for this business.

And we were very intentional about that to talk about those 4-week differences so that you can see. As we were before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%, I think it was 49.9%. And then we came out the other side. And on a 2-year basis, we were still up 26.7% in those last 4 weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last 4 weeks this year, were 14%, with the last 2 weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. 
So what we have seen is that stimulus -- stimulus dollars that came in March, they stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected, similar to what happened last summer. If you remember, our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year.

As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago, it's still that way today. 
If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers. I also talked about all this technology that we've rolled out. And we're still in the very early innings of that. We've seen reductions in our delivery times, but we are looking for significantly bigger, larger reductions in delivery times as this technology matures, as our team understands how to utilize it and how to change.

As I have said previously, throughout the pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the outstanding performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to enthusiastically meet and embrace the challenge. As we say, they're going the extra mile for our customers, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. 
I also want to reiterate our highest priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners. Again, you are remarkable. 
This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost, impact business for the remainder of the [indiscernible] 
Okay, on to our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none, of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. 
Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our Commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment. Additionally, we reached a new milestone in commercial sales surpassing $3 billion for the year, finishing with over $3.3 billion in annual sales versus $2.7 billion in sales a year ago, an impressive 23% increase. We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reaching $12,600 for the year, up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial, and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success. 
I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter. While our DIY 2-year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our 2-year stack same-store sales. In commercial, on a 2-year basis, our sales were very consistent with last year's performance -- sorry, last few quarter's performance. 
Now let's focus on our sales cadence. This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first 8-week comp was 3.1%. In the last 8 weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we, like others who benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales, believe it is more insightful to look at a 2-year stack comp. For Q4, our 2-year comp was 26.0%. On a 2-year basis, our cadence for each 4-week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%. Our 2-year comp sales trends were remarkably strong and fairly consistent across the [indiscernible] 
Regarding weather, we experienced a noticeably warmer summer out west than in previous years, which helped our sales. But we experienced a milder summer in the Midwest and Northeast, which drove our sales to underperform the chain there. Overall, weather impacts were neutral on our performance. 
Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4%, while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay-at-home orders and closures of big-box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year '22. 
During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets underperformed roughly 400 basis points in comp versus the remainder of the country. The data suggests that we have actually gained some share in these markets. However, we believe the milder summer weather was a large contributor to our sales comp results there. And across the country, in retail, our share trends remain strong despite the reopening of big-box retailers' automotive service departments that were closed this time last year. 
We have been very pleased that we have retained the roughly 10% market share we gained in our retail sales floor business last year. Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2's call, we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our ongoing PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter, reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine. 
I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first while caring deeply for our AutoZoners. We are strongly encouraging our AutoZoners to get the vaccine as our culture and values of taking care of one another have been on display for the past 18 months. 
Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 4.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $786 million, and our EPS was $35.72 a share, 15.5% above last year's fourth quarter. Our domestic retail same-store sales were down slightly for the quarter, while our commercial business remained remarkably strong. Commercial total sales grew approximately 21%. We averaged $74 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $14,400 in sales per program per week, which was easily an all-time record for us. The initiatives that we have in place are meaningfully helping our commercial business. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. 
Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales 4 categories continue to outpace the hard part categories with categories like wipers, fluids and lighting, all [indiscernible] Hard part, this was in line with our expectations and ran roughly flat with last year. We were especially pleased as last year our hard parts business was very strong, especially in categories like batteries. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. 
Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing in our space. This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories work their way through the system. We could see low single-digit inflation in retail as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long it will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades. 
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it is difficult to forecast near-term sales. What I will say is this past quarter sales were better than we expected, and we exited the fiscal year with strong fundamentals in our business. For FY '22, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our initiatives. Both DIY and commercial have gained considerable share that we are maintaining and we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth for the long term. We will earn our fair share, and we hope to exceed expectations. 
In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. As we progress here, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another great quarter. Our growth initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to maintain strong results. 
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $4.8 billion, up 8%. And for the total year, our total auto parts sales were $14.4 billion, up 15.9%. 
Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 21% to $1.2 billion and were up 31% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 24% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400, up 18% as we averaged $74 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts all grew over 20% in the quarter. 
For the full year, our commercial sales grew 22.6% and 29% on a 2-year stack basis. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. The disciplined investments we're making are helping us grow share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 72 net new programs, finishing with 5,179 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. 
In fiscal year '22, commercial growth will lead the way. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. We remain focused on delivering improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, making improvements in our assortment, maintaining competitive pricing and staying committed to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 5 quarters and position us well in the marketplace. 
As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our sales even further. Let me highlight one key initiative that is driving our performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses, and that's our Mega-Hub strategy. 
Our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we are doubling down. We now have 58 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 20 more over the next 12 months. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we're testing greater density of Mega-Hubs to drive even better sales results. With this effort, we are leveraging sophisticated analytics to help us expand our market reach, give us closer proximity to our customers and improve our product availability and delivery times. 
I will remind you that our current Mega-Hub strategy envisions our expansion to a total of 100 to 110 Mega-Hubs. However, as these assets continue to outperform our expectations, we would expect to expand significantly further. We are excited about this work and its ability to further accelerate our commercial growth. All of our efforts are building meaningful competitive advantage and give us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. 
On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down just 40 basis points, but up 23.4% on a 2-year stack. For the full year, the retail business was up 11.2% and 18.7% on a 2-year stack basis. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 300 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. We are excited about the initiatives that drove the tremendous sales and share growth, and the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. We are winning in the marketplace, and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers remains a key competitive advantage. 
As we exit fiscal '21, I'm really pleased with the competitive positioning of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. The work we have done on improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and Mega-Hub network and maintaining competitive pricing have led to tremendous results over the last 2 years. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. 
Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish with 664 stores and 5 new stores in Brazil to finish with 52. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 82 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investment in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 6.4%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range to our third quarter, where we were down 118 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, to drive a better-than-expected outcome. 
As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're beginning to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. And consistent with prior inflationary cycles, we have been successful thus far at passing these higher costs through our retailers. Overall, the industry pricing remains rational, and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we're committed to capturing our fair share while [indiscernible] our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We should expect our margins in the first quarter to be down in a similar range to the [ third ] quarter. We are, however, focused on driving [indiscernible] over time growing [indiscernible] at a faster rate in our total auto parts operating segment. 
Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic-related expenses in the previous year. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than its historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was just over $1 billion, up 2.6% versus prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. EBIT for fiscal year '21 was just over $2.9 billion, up 21.8% versus fiscal year '20. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $58 million, down 11.5% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $46 million to $48 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's first quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 22.3% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 35 basis points. For the first quarter of 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% for any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $786 million, up 6.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of 22 million was lower by 8.1% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.72, up 15.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income per share for fiscal year '21 was $95.19, up a remarkable 32.3%, reflecting our outstanding top line performance and lower share count. 
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and our liquidity position remains strong. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up [indiscernible] versus Q4 last year. Total [indiscernible] increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $203,000 versus negative $104,000 last year and negative $167,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.6% versus last year's Q4 of 115.3%. 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.1 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $418 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and over $900 million of excess cash. For the full year, we bought back $3.4 billion of stock or approximately 2.6 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year, combined with excess cash carried over from last year, has enabled us to buy back over 11% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to have powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. 
So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 6.1% increase in net income and a 15.5% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

I can't tell you how excited I am about next week. 
2022 will again be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. In fiscal '22, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We will be announcing some significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 20 new domestic Mega-Hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our ability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will open approximately 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. 
Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of the pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. And we welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone.

And then Jamere, you'll jump in and clarify things if I missed it so I had a mask on. First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark -- batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close-in competitors. So we have facts there. 
We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share. We haven't lost any of it. I mean it's on the margin. It's slightly positive, slightly negative month-to-month. We basically grew our share in that data set by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that, and I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time. 
On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data. But we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look at what's going on with our close-in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing at these kind of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples, 2 or 3x the market growth. 
Where all is it coming from? You probably have as good insights into that as we do. We look at the publicly available data. We see that we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic. It's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last 3 years as we implemented this latest round of strategy work where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage. We're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. 
We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our Mega-Hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close-in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts. Jamere, do you have anything to add?"

And that's what's really important. It's not an absolute price point, if you will, but it's a relative point. But as we have opportunities to take price up, we're certainly doing that."

I've been watching it [indiscernible] And it's generally a nice [indiscernible] but the [indiscernible] grows around 4% a year to grow 25% [indiscernible] step down some this summer. We saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really drove exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were. And we spend a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we do think that, that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product, of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. 
I would -- we spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores, and I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors, go look at us versus other retailers. It is a very -- in this interesting time, a very comfortable shopping environment, as comfortable as you can find, I believe. And so I think that customers have changed their shopping behaviors, they're not necessarily wanting to go to a big-box store. I think there are some online retailers that deemphasize this category during the pandemic. And fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year. 
We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to -- think about on a long-term historical basis, there have been before this period 3 times in my career where I've seen substantially above-industry performance -- or industry performance above the norm. And that was in '93 and '94, '01 and '02, '09, '10 and '11. All of those were coming out of very difficult economic environments. This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion. 
What was the interesting thing out of those most -- the best times that we've seen was, following each one of those times, we didn't step back down as an industry to where the performance was before. Will we have some step down as an industry? Maybe. But I don't expect it, and I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. Will it step back a little bit? Maybe. I don't know. Because this is unchartered waters. But I do -- reintroduce ourselves to some customers. And I think our existing customers have started relying on us on a frequent basis. And I believe many of those shop [indiscernible] 
Commercial side of the [indiscernible] I think it's somewhat related to the pandemic. I think we're winning in a big way in the marketplace. I think we have changed our competitive position because of all the initiatives that we have. So I am and I think we are quite bullish on the long term of the commercial business. I'll let you talk about the P&L."

We invest to grow our business, and we return a lot of that to shareholders. Over the last couple of years or so, we've had the opportunity to have outsized top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain. Bill talked about it in his comments this morning. You've seen us invest in our growth initiatives. And we've had an outsized return to shareholders. So the algorithm works. 
It's worked for us in the past. It's worked for us through this environment, where we've had accelerated sales, where we've done even more than we've done in the past. We've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our growth prospects going forward. We're going to have tremendous financial firepower to grow this business and return cash to shareholders.

We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close-in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that to those competitors that I'll call are half a step away. 
In the commercial business, we took much more significant pricing actions, and they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial. But we finished those actions at the [indiscernible] of this past quarter, call it, June. So -- and those took some time to roll in. We started it with 6 markets, and we went to 14 markets, and we rolled it to the chain. So we're beginning to annualize the first smaller tranches of that. And we will annualize that in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. 
We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy. But as you can see in our commercial performance, we're winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in 9 months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial.

The only thing that I'll add there is that our core capability inside the company hasn't changed. The things that we've historically worked on in terms of assortment, awesome work that our merchants have done over the years, the things that we see in terms of the industry's pricing dynamics, those things haven't changed. So now the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time. I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined as we've seen inflationary impacts in the business. We've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've often said that inflation is our friend in that regard. So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. 
What we've done, as Bill said, is we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business. And nothing else about our business has changed. So all the great work that we've done in the past, we still have that capability going forward."

But I just can't tell you what's going to happen in the environment. I mean we're sitting here take -- we got people with mask on, Jamere and I have taken our mask on and off to answer questions. I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we're done with them. And here we are with Delta variant. I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. 
I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level, as I keep calling it, to 3 decimal points. We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly, on our people. So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. 
So that will be over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend. But as we've said all along, our capital allocation strategy is: one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have to have them perform at an optimal level; two, invest in every growth aspect that we can that will provide us a reasonable IRR; and then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders. That algorithm is going to stay the same. 
I hope, in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY '20 and '21. I would have thought the same thing a year ago. I'm getting more and more confident that some of this is structural and some of this is permanent. What percentage? Your guess is as good as mine. I've never seen a global pandemic before."

And the way that costs actually end up flowing through the system, you typically will have a little bit of margin accretion, at least in the early innings as you raise retails before all the cost increases make their way through. And to the extent that we see price increases come, there are times where we actually move a little bit early. So those are things that can actually help you, at least in the near term, get a little bit of margin accretion and get out ahead of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint.

Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.  
As I have said previously, throughout the pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the outstanding performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to enthusiastically meet and embrace the challenge. As we say, they're going the extra mile for our customers, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.  
I also want to reiterate our highest priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners. Again, you are remarkable.  
This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost, impact business for the remainder of the calendar year. 
Okay, on to our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none, of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere.  
Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our Commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment. Additionally, we reached a new milestone in commercial sales surpassing $3 billion for the year, finishing with over $3.3 billion in annual sales versus $2.7 billion in sales a year ago, an impressive 23% increase. 
We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reaching $12,600 for the year, up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial, and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success.  
I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter. While our DIY 2-year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our 2-year stack same-store sales.  
In commercial, on a 2-year basis, our sales were very consistent with last year's performance -- sorry, last few quarter's performance.  
Now let's focus on our sales cadence. This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first 8 weeks of the quarter our comp was 3.1%. In the last 8 weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we, like others who benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales, believe it is more insightful to look at a 2-year stack comp. 
For Q4, our 2-year comp was 26.0%. On a 2-year basis, our cadence for each 4-week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%. Our 2-year comp sales trends were remarkably strong and fairly consistent across the quarter.
Regarding weather, we experienced a noticeably warmer summer out west than in previous years, which helped our sales. But we experienced a milder summer in the Midwest and Northeast, which drove our sales to underperform the chain there. Overall, weather impacts were neutral on our performance.  
Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4%, while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay-at-home orders and closures of big-box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. 
Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year '22.  
During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets underperform roughly 400 basis points in comp versus the remainder of the country. 
The data suggests that we have actually gained some share in these markets. However, we believe the milder summer weather was a large contributor to our sales comp results there. And across the country, in retail, our share trends remain strong despite the reopening of big-box retailers' automotive service departments that were closed this time last year.  
We have been very pleased that we have retained the roughly 10% market share we gained in our retail sales floor business last year. Our #1 priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2's call, we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our ongoing PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter, reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine.  
I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first while caring deeply for our AutoZoners. We are strongly encouraging our AutoZoners to get the vaccine as our culture and values of taking care of one another have been on display for the past 18 months.  
Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 4.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $786 million, and our EPS was $35.72 a share, 15.5% above last year's fourth quarter. Our domestic retail same-store sales were down slightly for the quarter, while our commercial business remained remarkably strong. 
Commercial total sales grew approximately 21%. We averaged $74 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $14,400 in sales per program per week, which was easily an all-time record for us. The initiatives that we have in place are meaningfully helping our commercial business.  
I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time.  
Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to outpace the hard part categories with categories like wipers, fluids and lighting, all showing strength. Our hard parts, this was in line with our expectations and ran roughly flat with last year. We were especially pleased as last year our hard parts business was very strong, especially in categories like batteries. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more.  
Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing in our space. This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories worked their way through the system. 
We could see low single-digit inflation in retail as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long it will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades.  
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it is difficult to forecast near-term sales. What I will say is this past quarter sales were better than we expected, and we exited the fiscal year with strong fundamentals in our business. For FY '22, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our initiatives. 
Both DIY and commercial had gained considerable share that we are maintaining and we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth for the long term. We will earn our fair share and we hope to exceed expectations.  
In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.  
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had another great quarter. Our growth initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to maintain strong results.  
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $4.8 billion, up 8%. And for the total year, our total auto parts sales were $14.4 billion, up 15.9%.  
Now, let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 21% to $1.2 billion and were up 31% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 24% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400, up 18% as we averaged $74 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts all grew over 20% in the quarter.  
For the full year, our commercial sales grew 22.6% and 29% on a 2-year stack basis. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. The disciplined investments we're making are helping us grow share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. 
We now have our commercial program in over 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 72 net new programs, finishing with 5,179 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers.  
In fiscal year '22, commercial growth will lead the way. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. We remain focused on delivering improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, making improvements in our assortment, maintaining competitive pricing and staying committed to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 5 quarters and position us well in the marketplace.  
As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our sales even further. Let me highlight one key initiative that is driving our performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses, and that's our Mega-Hub strategy.  
Our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we are doubling down. We now have 58 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 20 more over the next 12 months. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores. 
The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we're testing greater density of Mega-Hubs to drive even better sales results. With this effort, we are leveraging sophisticated analytics to help us expand our market reach, give us closer proximity to our customers and improve our product availability and delivery times.  
I will remind you that our current Mega-Hub strategy envisions our expansion to a total of 100 to 110 Mega-Hubs. However, as these assets continue to outperform our expectations, we would expect to expand significantly further. We are excited about this work and its ability to further accelerate our commercial growth. All of our efforts are building meaningful competitive advantage and give us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business.  
On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down just 40 basis points, but up 23.4% on a 2-year stack. For the full year, the retail business was up 11.2% and 18.7% on a 2-year stack basis. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 300 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. 
We are excited about the initiatives that drove the tremendous sales and share growth, and the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. We are winning in the marketplace, and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers remains a key competitive advantage.  
As we exit fiscal '21, I'm really pleased with the competitive positioning of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. The work we have done on improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and Mega-Hub network and maintaining competitive pricing have led to tremendous results over the last 2 years. 
DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results.  
Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish with 664 stores and 5 new stores in Brazil to finish with 52. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future.  
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 82 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investment in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 6.4%. 
I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range to our third quarter, where we were down 118 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, to drive a better-than-expected outcome.  
As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're beginning to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. And consistent with prior inflationary cycles, we have been successful thus far at passing these higher costs through our retails. Overall, the industry pricing remains rational, and we're pricing accordingly. 
All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We should expect our margins in the first quarter to be down in a similar range to the fourth quarter. We are, however, focused on driving new customers to AutoZone and over time growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment.  
Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic-related expenses in the previous year. 
While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.  
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was just over $1 billion, up 2.6% versus prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. EBIT for fiscal year '21 was just over $2.9 billion, up 21.8% versus fiscal year '20. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $58 million, down 11.5% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. 
We're planning interest in the $46 million to $48 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's first quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 22.3% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 35 basis points. For the first quarter of 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% for any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises.  
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $786 million, up 6.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of 22 million was lower by 8.1% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.72, up 15.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income per share for fiscal year '21 was $95.19, up a remarkable 32.3%, reflecting our outstanding top line performance and lower share count.  
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and our liquidity position remains strong. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 0.4% versus Q4 last year. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores. 
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $203,000 versus negative $104,000 last year and negative $167,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.6% versus last year's Q4 of 115.3%.  
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.1 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $418 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and over $900 million of excess cash. 
For the full year, we bought back $3.4 billion of stock or approximately 2.6 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year, combined with excess cash carried over from last year, has enabled us to buy back over 11% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. 
We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to have powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.  
So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 6.1% increase in net income and a 15.5% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.  
Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

I can't tell you how excited I am about next week.  
2022 will again be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. In fiscal '22, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We will be announcing some significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 20 new domestic Mega-Hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our ability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. 
We will open approximately 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. 
Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of the pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. 
And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. And we welcome that challenge.

And then Jamere, you'll jump in and clarify any things, if I miss it, sorry I had a mask on. 
First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark -- and plus batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close-in competitors. So we have facts there. 
We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share. We haven't lost any of it. I mean it's on the margin. It's slightly positive, slightly negative month-to-month. But we basically grew our share in that data set by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that, and I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time. 
On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data. But we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look at what's going on with our close-in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing at these kind of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples, 2 or 3x the market growth. 
Where all is it coming from? You probably have as good insights into that as we do. We look at the publicly available data. We see that we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic. It's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last 3 years as we implemented this latest round of strategy, where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage. We're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. 
We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our Mega-Hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close-in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts, Jamere, do you have anything to add?"

And we talked about on our previous earnings call that we've been testing our market potential in Brazil for really the last decade or so. And we think Brazil can be a very big market for us. So we've got great potential there. 
We've made some leadership changes as well. So Tom Newbern is leading our international efforts going forward. Tom is a fantastic operator, has a ton of experience, and we look forward to that being a much bigger part of our story and our strategy as we go forward."

If you look at the -- our business overall is up roughly 25% versus pre-pandemic levels. You've been watching this industry for a long time. I've been watching it longer. And it's generally a nice grower, but the industry grows around 4% a year to grow 25% over 18 months is pretty phenomenal. 
I think as we've said in our prepared comments, we expected our sales to step down some this summer. We saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really grow to exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were. 
And we spend a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we do think that, that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID, in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product, of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. 
I would -- we spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores, and I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors, go look at us versus other retailers. It is a very -- in this interesting time, a very comfortable shopping environment, as comfortable as you can find, I believe. 
And so I think that customers have changed their shopping behaviors, they're not necessarily wanting to go to a big-box store. I think there are some online retailers that deemphasize this category during the pandemic. And fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year. 
We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to -- think about on a long-term historical basis, there have been before this period 3 times in my career where I've seen substantially above-industry performance -- or industry performance above the norm. And that was in '93 and '94, '01 and '02, '09, '10 and '11. All of those were coming out of very difficult economic environments. This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion. 
What was the interesting thing out of those most -- the best times that we've seen was, following each one of those times, we didn't step back down as an industry to where the performance was before. We only have some step down as an industry? Maybe. But I don't expect it, and I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. 
Will it step back a little bit? Maybe. I don't know. Because this is unchartered waters. But I do think we have reintroduced ourselves to some customers. And I think our existing customers have started relying on us on a frequent basis. And I believe many of those shopping habits will have changed forever. 
On the commercial side of the business, I think it's somewhat related to the pandemic. I think we're winning in a big way in the marketplace. I think we have changed our competitive position because of all the initiatives that we have. So I am and I think we are quite bullish on the long term of the commercial business.

Over the last couple of years or so, we've had the opportunity to have outsized top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain.

We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close-in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that to those competitors that I'll call are half a step away. 
In the commercial business, we took much more significant pricing actions, and they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial. But we finished those actions at the beginning of this past quarter, call it, June. So -- and those took some time to roll in. We started it with 6 markets, and we went to 14 markets, and we rolled it to the chain. So we're beginning to annualize the first smaller tranches of that. And we will annualize that in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. 
We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy. But as you can see in our commercial performance, we're winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in 9 months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial.

So now the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time. I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined as we've seen inflationary impacts hit the business. We've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've often said that inflation is our friend in that regard. 
So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. What we've done, as Bill said, is we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business.

I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we were done with them. And here we are with Delta variant. I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. 
I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level, as I keep calling it, to 3 decimal points. We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly, on our people. 
So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. 
So that will be over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend. But as we've said all along, our capital allocation strategy is: one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have, to have them perform at an optimal level. Two, invest in every growth aspect that we can that will provide us a reasonable IRR. And then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders. That algorithm is going to stay the same. 
I hope, in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY '20 and '21.

And our merchants have done a fantastic job of negotiating timing and also done a fantastic job of making sure that we got retails raised in a way that kept us competitive in the marketplace. 
And the way that costs actually end up flowing through the system, you typically will have a little bit of margin accretion, at least in the early innings as you raise retails before all the cost increases make their way through. And to the extent that we see price increases come, there are times when we actually move a little bit early. So those are things that can actually help you, at least in the near term, get a little bit of margin accretion and get out ahead of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint.

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. 
Regarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. 
As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I'm very proud of how our team has responded. 
Since the start of the pandemic, we've reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners as our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing wow customer service, regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way. 
As part of saying thank you to our AutoZoners, this past quarter, the company committed $9 million to the AutoZoner Assistance Fund. The Assistance Fund is an independent nonprofit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to auto's owners who find themselves in a very difficult place. We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way. To me, it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values. We can't thank our team of roughly 105,000 AutoZoners enough for all they do for our customers, each other, our communities and, ultimately, our shareholders. 
This morning, we'll review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance in any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Okay. Onto our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 12.3%. Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and delivered amazing results. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rate for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%. Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales, I was reflecting on that this morning, remembering back to the day that we cracked $1 billion in commercial sales for a full year. And now we've delivered $900 million in sales in 1 quarter, an incredible accomplishment. 
On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, 27%. 
We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year. 
On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%. Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial. 
In short, it is not one thing. And I want to repeat that. It is not one thing. It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years. Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and Mega-Hub coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. 
We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%. Wow. 
While our DIY 2-year stack comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% 2-year comp in this sector of our business. 
From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and ending -- and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long term. 
Now let's focus on our sales cadence. Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November, However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed. Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we, like others who benefited from the pandemic, believed it is more instructive to look at 2-year stacked comps. 
On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable. For Q1, our 2-year comp was 25.8%, and the 4-week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3% -- 26.0% and 25.3%, respectively. 
Regarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the Northeastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter. 
As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter. Historically, extreme weather, be that hot or cold, helps drive parts failure. 
Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was up 1%, while our ticket was up 7.5%. This low single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels. although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stims, reduce the elimination of enhanced unemployment stay at home orders and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year. 
In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers . It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months. 
Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. 
Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was up about 2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. We could see mid-single-digit inflation in retail as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past 3 quarter sales have all been consistent on a 2-year stacked comp basis, and both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient. 
While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains. 
Currently, the macro environment, while more uncertain than normal is certainly favorable for our industry. And if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. 
For FY '22, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. 
As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets, and outlooks as trends emerge. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter. Our growth initiatives continue to deliver strong results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 16.2%. The -- Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million and were up 41% on a 2-year stack basis. 
Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400, up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. The disciplined investments we are making are helping us grow share and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have a commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 32 net new programs finishing with 5,211 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. 
As I said on last quarter's call and fiscal year '22, commercial growth will lead the way, and our first quarter results reflect these dynamics. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 6 quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. 
And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. 
Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum doubling down. We now have 62 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. 
As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as service and fulfillment sorts for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses, and we're testing greater density of Mega-Hubs to drive even stronger sales results by leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we are expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. These assets continue to outperform our expectations and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted. 
In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. 
On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained over 3 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. 
As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and share growth, along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers. These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and Mega-Hub network and maintaining competitive pricing. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing car park in a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY, and the execution of our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage. 
I'm also pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. Our in-stock positions, while still below where we would like for them to be, are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have products available to meet our customers' needs. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. 
Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. 
During the quarter, we opened 2 new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and 1 new store in Brazil to finish with 53. 
On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, where we were down 82 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better-than-expected outcome. 
As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter. All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We are laser-focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone and over time, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate. 
Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 171 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times. 
We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million, down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's second quarter. 
For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% in last year's first quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, benefited 134 basis points. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. 
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter. our diluted share count of 21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69, up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter. 
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. 
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 10% versus Q1 last year. Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year driven by new stores. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year a negative $203,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%. 
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. we repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash. The powerful free cash we generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter. We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to maintain our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. 
To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS. We We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Our customers across the Americas want to get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers. While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in-stock levels, we believe we are better than most retailers, and I think our results support that belief. 
For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will also be leveraging our hub and Mega-Hub strategy further in Mexico. 
For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet aggressive. Before we move to open up the call for questions. I want to take a moment, a moment to give special thanks to Mark Finestone, our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation Customer satisfaction on his upcoming retirement in early calendar 2022. Our company, our customers, our leadership team and in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service. Mark spent the majority of this year with AutoZone leading our merchandising team and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years. He leaves our organization much, much better than he found it, and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth. We thank Mark for his service and leadership with the company, and we wish he and his wife Cindy well in their well-deserved retirement. 
I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. And we, we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. 
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Mega-Hubs is a critical part of it. But don't forget, we also refreshed the assortments in every single AutoZone store in the United States and put those assortments commercial leaning forward. But the Mega-Hubs are helping us a tremendous amount, but so is the Duralast brand, so is our sales force, so is our engagement of our store managers and district managers. We see the Mega-Hubs in and of themselves perform exceptionally well. They continue to exceed our expectations. And as we've said, we're going to go to 100 to 110.

I think it's [indiscernible] stories, right? On the DIY side of the business, clearly, there were some significant share gains that happened in the depths of the pandemic and the stay-at-home orders, where we did pick up a lot of share from mass retailers. We anticipated that we would have a pretty good headwind starting in -- last August, but that simply hasn't manifested itself. And I think what's happened is customers that were coming to us before experienced us during the midst of this crisis and really enjoyed their experience. Our team did a great job. So I think it's still coming from those more mass-oriented in the retail side of the business. 
On the commercial side of the business, we believe it's likely coming from the smaller players. You mentioned WDs. And I think over time, what happened was a lot of people when the sales went down in our industry by about 25% overnight, a lot of people in our industry pulled back considerably. Some people furloughed people, they laid off people. They took their order inventory orders down significantly. We certainly took some actions. We never furloughed 1 person. We never terminated 1 person because of the pandemic. In fact, we gave them 2 extra weeks of vacation, we called emergency time off. And so when all of a sudden, the business rebounded very quickly, we were in a terrific place. And I think that gave us trial in the commercial business with a lot of folks that we might not have gotten trial as quick as we did otherwise. And when we were there for those customers, I think that they appreciated the whole host of offerings that we had, and we've continued to grow since then. I mean to be up 40% on a 2-year basis is  astounding, be up 29% in this quarter alone. I just couldn't be more pleased of what our team has done. And we believe this is just the beginning. We've talked about the importance of the commercial business for a long time. And we're still the fourth in market share, and that's not where we want to be, and I'm excited about what's in front of us."

And I think about the AutoZone that Mark inherited versus the AutoZone that he leaves to the rest of us, and it's a very different place, and he played an enormous role and as did so many others, but thank you for that. 
I share your thoughts, Simeon, at Apex, there was a different vibe than probably we've ever seen before. I was kind of hoping everybody would be down and out because I knew how our sales were performing. I hope we were doing very different than everyone else. And I think it's just a great reminder of the strength of this industry. If you think about this industry over a very long period of time, I just celebrated my 27th anniversary with AutoZone, seeing a lot of different cycles. 
One of the things that has happened the strongest performing periods in our last 30 years have been '93, '94, '01, '02, '09, '10 and '11. That is before the pandemic. the pandemic has blown away those performance. In each one of those environments, you've seen AutoZone's performance maybe more than the industry, but the industry also make a step function change up significant growth in the midst of a recession. What has been remarkable is in each of those times, you've never seen the industry or our sales take a step back down, not even partially back down towards it. It's as if we reached a new plateau and we just stayed there until we built again. 
I think my expectation with the pandemic and the amount of sales that we saw, particularly in the retail business from the depths of the stay at home orders and all those things was we would see somewhat a reversion to the mean. And here we sit today, it's December, the last stimulus happened March 15. The enhanced unemployment ended at the end of August 1st of September, and we would have thought we would have seen some deceleration, which we have not seen. Our business on both sides of the business, a 9% comp in DIY is remarkable. 
And so we'll be interested to see how long it holds at this level. I wish we had a crystal ball and could tell you, but I know that this organization is focused on how do we optimize our performance in the midst of whatever sales environment we have. How do we make sure we're taking care of customers, how do we make sure that we're keeping AutoZoners and customers safe, and how do we make the P&L work and maximize our performance. And I think we've done a really good job of that, and I'm very proud of the organization so far."

So if you think about gross margins, first of all, I'll say this, we've been seeing cost inflation in certain categories and higher transportation costs.

And as Bill mentioned, from a retail pricing standpoint, where we raised retails in sort of mid-single-digit range. The industry has been disciplined and rational. And quite frankly, inflation has been our friend in terms of retail pricing. 
But I will remind you, as you've highlighted here is that our commercial business will be a mix drag. And right now, we're significantly outpacing DIY growth on the commercial side of the business. And so that's been a margin drag. In fact, all of the margin drag in this quarter can be attributed to that acceleration that we have in our commercial business. So going forward, it will be a drag on the business and -- but that will be good for us as a business because we'll see our gross profit dollars grow and, which is exactly what we're shooting for. So we like where we are. We're going to continue to lean into the strategy. you'll see a little bit of a drag from a margin standpoint from commercial mix.

The perception early in the pandemic was that the marginal or incremental customer was that more affluent consumer who is working from home had more time on their hands, is doing some work on their car as a result. Is that still the incremental customer? Or has it evolved given some of the underlying dynamics, like fewer new car sales, stimulus or other factors?"

I wish I could tell you with certainty it was built by X, Y and Z. Let me just share some of our thoughts.

I wish I could tell you with certainty it was built by X, Y and Z. Let me just share some of our thoughts. But our thoughts are evolving, and we don't have clear insights into the strength of it, which we're tickled up to have, but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly, an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive, slightly positive in the retail business. Normally, because of changes in technology and the improvement of quality of parts. We've typically had 3%, 3.5% deceleration in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year, we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have, let's say, on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit that's, call it, 4% or so, on top of that. So that is a significant element. When we believe -- what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic was we had a lot of what I call our financially fragile customers those at lower socioeconomic customers that had 2 things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed, and they had money because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated, as those 2 things ended and March 15 of '21 and early September '21 on enhanced unemployment, that we would see it slow down. I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years as people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right, versus thinking they're going to get a new car in 6 months, I don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and used car prices being up, I think the last time I saw it something like 38% I think people, in particular, are more challenged economically customers are thinking, I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it. And I think that also all levels of consumer appear to still be very, very healthy financially versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years, any period where there's a tax refund or something we see a big spike in our business stimulus. We saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business. It's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long? Your guess is as good as mine."

Historically, AutoZone's algorithm has been modest store growth, 2% to 4% comp, stable margins and healthy share repurchases to deliver double-digit EPS growth. Jamere made the point that you're building a faster-growing business. So does the algorithm change moving forward, especially if commercial sustains its recent increases and puts pressure on your gross margin, would you be willing to accept a formula over the long run where you have a slightly higher same-store sales growth, even if that meant about the same gross profit dollar growth that you've had historically because it comes with gross margin pressure over the longer run. And as part of that, I think Jamere mentioned that COGS inflation was 2%. Price increases were 4%. So you saw gross margin benefit this quarter from that spread.

Let me start, and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well. 
Yes, we've had a long-term algorithm that says, how do we grow store count in the 2% to 3%, how do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times and maybe faster in these recessionary environments. How do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to do share repurchases that push us in and around double-digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time. You remember, Michael, we had, I think, 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. So that's still long term, generally the model that we believe. 
However, we've had the most incredible 6 straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is. I would have thought we would have experienced that. by now, I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growth over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought 6 and 12 months ago. But -- so we may have a slowdown at some point, but I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any. You ask, would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages, and I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate while we make sure we get great returns. And I think any organization is running roughly a 40% ROIC, we've proven that we know how to leverage our capital structure. Jamere, anything that you would say differently or do you want to address this last point?"

We have the luxury of having in this environment, a faster-growing business with higher margin dollars overall.

What doesn't change in the -- about the algorithm is the most important part of the algorithm, which is this is a business that is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash that enables us to grow our business and return a significant amount of cash to shareholders over time. So as we've gone through this period, and we see an opportunity to accelerate the growth in our commercial business by creating a faster-growing business. Overall, it's ultimately meaning that we're a more profitable company on a dollar basis. And that's going to lead to more cash and we're going to grow the business and return a significant chunk of that to shareholders. 
So long term, what I've been saying is that while the geography changes a little bit, the algorithm at the bottom line doesn't change. This is a business that generates a ton of cash and has tremendous firepower to grow and return cash to shareholders."

But from a total EBITDA standpoint, we'll be in pretty good shape, and it will be a great story. 
And again, I always come back to this notion that from an earnings standpoint and from a cash standpoint, the most important part of this algorithm is that we're going to have tremendous firepower to grow the business and return a bunch of cash to shareholders."

Our hope and my hope is that we maintain all of it or certainly a significant amount of it that's yet to be seen, but that changed the economics of the operating margin in the DIY business. Our focus, whether it's 1% or 2% is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return. And sometimes our margin -- our operating margin might go down because I've said for many times, if we could double our commercial business at a substantially lower operating margin tomorrow, we would do it because it doesn't require a lot of capital, and it would grow our operating profit dollars tremendously."

But I'll go back to what I said earlier. We historically haven't seen it revert back to the norms. If you look at our business in the quarter, our retail business, our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10% during the depths of the crisis, and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that. I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not -- and then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time. The bigger question is the 1 that you're bringing up. if we continue to see significant inflation across the market, does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low-end consumer. And ultimately, do we see a deceleration as a result of that. And I think that's logical thesis, but we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition."

And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. -- you talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers, our business is up or more since the pre-pandemic level. Our supply chain, our manufacturers and their supply chains, nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. our teams have done a really, really, really good job of managing through it. That said, we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time. and they'll go down a little bit and they'll come up a little bit, but we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis. 
To your point, are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future. And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do, we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects, we're playing a little bit of whack-a-mole in the beginning of a particular categories, sand paper, now it's tools and brake rotors. We also, back in the summertime, we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai to the U.S. Now it's can we get them through the ports in the U.S. And our team has been really creative about getting the ships but now also finding different ports across the country to go to. 
So we are seeing it get better, but we are nowhere out of the woods on seeing that next month, we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year, which is always a difficult time in any supply chain. So it will be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring, early summer, we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought, okay, this one is easing. There's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges."

When you look at the stack comps that have been extraordinarily resilient here, even as the economy has moved away from the pan down, they can consume the benefits of stimulus.

Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million, $150 million kind of range over last year. And -- but we'll have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years. And as we've talked about as a team, think over the long term, we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point. When you've been through a surge in volume like we've experienced over the last 20 months, that was probably a little penny wise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments. We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last 4 years. from inventory assortments to Mega-Hubs and hubs to investments in the Duralast brand to investments in price, investments in technology, the single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company. is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it, but we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business. So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today, we're looking at are there other places that we can invest. 
I also want to say one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done it nearly at the same level as we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture through things like emergency time off. The last time I tallied up what we'd invested from emergency time off, vaccine incentives and those kinds of things, we were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this, if we're going to have values that we state, it's imperative that we live consistent with those values, and I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic. 
All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Brian. So before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022.
Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care."

If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.
As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I'm very proud of how our team has responded.
Since the start of the pandemic, we've reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing wow customer service, regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way.
As part of saying thank you to our AutoZoners, this past quarter, the company committed $9 million to the AutoZoner Assistance Fund. The assistance fund is an independent nonprofit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place. We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way. To me, it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values. We can't thank our team of roughly 105,000 AutoZoners enough for all they do for our customers, each other, our communities and, ultimately, our shareholders.
This morning, we'll review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Okay. Onto our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 12.3%. Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and delivered amazing results. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere.
Our growth rate for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%. Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales. I was reflecting on that this morning and remembering back to the day that we cracked $1 billion in commercial sales for a full year. And now we've delivered $900 million in sales in 1 quarter, an incredible accomplishment.
On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year. On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%.
Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial. In short, it is not one thing. And I want to repeat that. It is not one thing. It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years. Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability; massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage and access; the continuing strength of the Duralast brand; leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times; enhancing our sales force effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business; and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance.
We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran a 9% comp this quarter, on top of last year's 12.7%. Wow. While our DIY 2-year stack comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20%, 2-year comp in this sector of our business.
From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic but modestly build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and ending -- and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long term.
Now let's focus on our sales cadence. Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November. However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed. Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we, like others who benefited from the pandemic, believed it is more instructive to look at 2-year stack comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable. For Q1, our 2-year comp was 25.8%, and the 4-week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26.0% and 25.3%, respectively.
Regarding weather, we experienced warmer-than-usual weather in the Northeastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter. As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder-than-usual winter. Historically, extreme weather, be that hot or cold, helps drive parts failure.
Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was up 1%, while our ticket was up 7.5%. This low single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stimulus, the reduce -- the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay-at-home orders and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year.
In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months.
During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better other, as there always are. While last quarter we saw a roughly 400-basis-point gap in comp performance between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country, we did not see that gap this quarter. In fact, the Northeast and Midwestern markets slightly outperformed. The market share data suggest that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country.
Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter. Our net income was $555 million. Our EPS was $25.69 a share, increasing an impressive 38.1%.
Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more.
Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was up about 2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. We could see mid-single-digit inflation in retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.
While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past 3 quarter sales have all been consistent on a 2-year stack comp basis, and both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains.
Currently, the macro environment, while more uncertain than normal, is certainly favorable for our industry. And if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY '22, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets, and outlooks as trends emerge.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?"

As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter. Our growth initiatives continue to deliver strong results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage",1947,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter. Our growth initiatives continue to deliver strong results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions.
To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.6 billion, up 16.2%.
Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million and were up 41% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400, up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter.
Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. The disciplined investments we are making are helping us grow share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have a commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 32 net new programs, finishing with 5,211 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. As I said on last quarter's call, in fiscal year '22, commercial growth will lead the way, and our first quarter results reflect this dynamic.
Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 6 quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.
Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we're doubling down. We now have 62 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as service and fulfillment sorts for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses, and we're testing greater density of Mega-Hubs to drive even stronger sales results.
By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we are expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. These assets continue to outperform our expectation, and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted.
In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business.
On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained over 3 points of market share since the start of the pandemic.
As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and share growth, along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers. These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our Hub and Mega-Hub network and maintaining competitive pricing. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY. And the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage.
I'm also very pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. Our in-stock positions, while still below where we would like for them to be, are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have products available to meet our customers' needs. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remain strong.
Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 2 new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and 1 new store in Brazil to finish with 53. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future.
With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.
Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year where we were down 82 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better-than-expected outcome.
As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter.
All of the actions we are taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We are laser-focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone and over time, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate.
Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 171 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times.
We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million, down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year's second quarter.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% in last year's first quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year benefited 134 basis points. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.
Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69, up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter.
Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.
Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and our liquidity position remains strong.
We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 0.1% versus Q1 last year. Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year driven by new stores.
Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per store basis was a negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year and negative $203,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%.
Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash. The powerful free cash we generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter. We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.
We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to maintain our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.
To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working, and I have tremendous confidence in ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Bill."

Fiscal 2022 is off to a stellar start, and we continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. That and our culture is what defines us. From July 4, 1979, when our first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas, customer service has been paramount to our success.
At the end of the day, it is why customers come back to us, whether they are a seasoned professional or a new DIYer. They trust us. They trust us to help them with their needs. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the new year. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the foreseeable future. Our customers across the Americas want to get out, get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice.
Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers. While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in-stock levels, we believe we are better than most retailers, and I think our results support that belief.
For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We are focused on further growing share but, as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic Mega-Hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will also be leveraging our Hub and Mega-Hub strategy further in Mexico.
For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects. We are being disciplined yet aggressive.
Before we move to open up the call for questions. I want to take a moment, a moment to give special thanks to Mark Finestone, our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation, Customer Satisfaction, on his upcoming retirement in early calendar 2022. Our company, our customers, our leadership team and, in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service. Mark spent the majority of these years with AutoZone leading our merchandising team and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years. He leaves our organization much, much better than he found it and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth. We thank Mark for his amazing service and leadership with the company, and we wish he and his wife Cindy well in their well-deserved retirement.
I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. And we, we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone.
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

We talked about it about 4 years ago that we were launching a new strategic plan or developing a new strategic plan for our commercial business, and it has a whole host of elements. Mega-Hubs is a critical part of it.
But don't forget, we also refreshed the assortments in every single AutoZone store in the United States and put those assortments commercial leaning forward. But the Mega-Hubs are helping us a tremendous amount, but so is the Duralast brand, so is our sales force, so is our engagement of our store managers and district managers. We see the Mega-Hubs in and of themselves perform exceptionally well. They continue to exceed our expectations. And as we've said, we're going to go to 100 to 110.
I think we've also said that Jamere and I and the senior leadership team believe, once we're finished, we'll be closer to 200 Mega-Hubs than we will be 100 Mega-Hubs. But that's a vision at this point in time, not a plan."

I think it's a tale of two stories, right? On the DIY side of the business, clearly, there were some significant share gains that happened in the depths of the pandemic and the stay-at-home orders where we did pick up a lot of share from mass retailers. We anticipated that we would have a pretty good headwind starting in last August, but that simply hasn't manifested itself. And I think what's happened is customers that were coming to us before experienced us during the midst of this crisis and really enjoyed their experience. Our team did a great job. So I think it's still coming from those more mass-oriented in the retail side of the business.
On the commercial side of the business, we believe it's likely coming from the smaller players. You mentioned WDs. And I think, over time, what happened was a lot of people -- when the sales went down in our industry by about 25% overnight, a lot of people in our industry pulled back considerably. Some people furloughed people. They laid off people. They took their order -- inventory orders down significantly. We certainly took some actions. We never furloughed 1 person. We never terminated 1 person because of the pandemic. In fact, we gave them 2 extra weeks of vacation, we called emergency time off.
And so when all of a sudden, the business rebounded very quickly, we were in a terrific place. And I think that gave us trial in the commercial business with a lot of folks that we might not have gotten trial as quick as we did otherwise. And when we were there for those customers, I think that they appreciated the whole host of offerings that we had, and we've continued to grow since then. I mean to be up 40% on a 2-year basis is really astounding and to be up 29% in this quarter alone. I just couldn't be more pleased of what our team has done.
And we believe this is just the beginning. We've talked about the importance of the commercial business for a long time. And we're still the fourth in market share, and that's not where we want to be, and I'm excited about what's in front of us."

And I think about the AutoZone that Mark inherited versus the AutoZone that he leaves to the rest of us, and it's a very different place, and he played an enormous role and as did so many others. But thank you for that.
I share your thoughts, Simeon. At Apex, there was a different vibe than probably we've ever seen before. I was kind of hoping everybody would be down and out because I knew how our sales were performing. I hope we were doing very different than everyone else. I think it's just a great reminder of the strength of this industry. If you think about this industry over a very long period of time, I just celebrated my 27th anniversary with AutoZone, seeing a lot of different cycles.
One of the things that has happened, the strongest performing periods in our 30 -- last 30 years have been '93, '94, '01, '02, '09, '10 and '11. That is before the pandemic. The pandemic has blown away those performance. In each one of those environments, you've seen AutoZone's performance maybe more than the industry, but the industry also make a step function change up significant growth in the midst of a recession. What has been remarkable is in each of those times, you've never seen the industry or our sales take a step back down, not even partially back down towards it. It's as if we reached a new plateau, and we just stayed there until we built again.
I think my expectation with the pandemic and the amount of sales that we saw, particularly in the retail business from the depths of the stay-at-home orders and all those things, was we would see somewhat a reversion to the mean. And here we sit today, it's December, the last stimulus happened March 15. The enhanced unemployment ended at the end of August, 1st of September, and we would have thought we would have seen some deceleration, which we have not seen. Our business -- on both sides of the business, a 9% comp in DIY is remarkable.
And so we'll be interested to see how long it holds at this level. I wish we had a crystal ball and could tell you, but I know that this organization is focused on how do we optimize our performance in the midst of whatever sales environment we have, how do we make sure we're taking care of customers, how do we make sure that we're keeping AutoZoners and customers safe and how do we make the P&L work and maximize our performance. And I think we've done a really good job of that, and I'm very proud of the organization so far."

So if you think about gross margins, first of all, I'll say this, we've been seeing cost inflation in certain categories and higher transportation costs. However, the industry pricing has been rational, and we're pricing to recover inflationary impacts as we've done in the past. And as Bill mentioned, from a retail pricing standpoint, where we raised retails in the sort of mid-single-digit range, the industry has been disciplined and rational. And quite frankly, inflation has been our friend in terms of retail pricing.
But I will remind you, as you've highlighted here, is that our commercial business will be a mix drag. And right now, we're significantly outpacing DIY growth on the commercial side of the business. And so that's been a margin drag. In fact, all of the margin drag in this quarter can be attributed to that acceleration that we have in our commercial business.
So going forward, it will be a drag on the business and -- but that will be good for us as a business because we'll see our gross profit dollars grow, which is exactly what we're shooting for. So we like where we are. We're going to continue to lean into the strategy. You'll see a little bit of a drag from a margin standpoint from commercial mix.

But our thoughts are evolving, and we don't have clear insights into the strength of it, which we're tickled to death to have, but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly, an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive, slightly positive in the retail business.
Normally, because of changes in technology and the improvement of quality of parts, we've typically had 3%, 3.5% deceleration in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year, we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have, let's say, on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit that's, call it, 4% or so on top of that. So that is a significant element.
When we believe -- what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic was we had a lot of, what I call, our financially fragile customers, those lower socioeconomic customers, that had 2 things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed, and they had money because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated, as those 2 things ended in March 15 of '21 and early September '21 on enhanced unemployment, that we would see it slow down.
I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years is people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right versus thinking they're going to get a new car in 6 months and don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and used car prices being up, I think the last time I saw it something like 38%, I think people, in particular, are more challenged economically. Customers are thinking, I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it.
And I think that also all levels of consumer appear to still be very, very healthy financially versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years, any period where there's a tax refund or something, we see a big spike in our business stimulus. We saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business. It's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long? Your guess is as good as mine."

Historically, AutoZone's algorithm has been modest store growth, 2% to 4% comp, stable margins and healthy share repurchases to deliver double-digit EPS growth. Jamere made the point that you're building a faster-growing business. So does the algorithm change moving forward? Especially if commercial sustains its recent increases and puts pressure on your gross margin, would you be willing to accept a formula over the long run where you have a slightly higher same-store sales growth, even if that meant about the same gross profit dollar growth that you've had historically because it comes with gross margin pressure over the longer run? And as part of that, I think Jamere mentioned that COGS inflation was 2%. Price increases were 4%. So you saw gross margin benefit this quarter from that spread. Doesn't that reverse in the quarters ahead?"

Let me start, and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well.Yes, we've had a long-term algorithm that says, how do we grow store count in the 2% to 3%, how do we grow EBIT grow",321,"You has 3 very complex questions. I think the answers are yes, yes and yes. Let me start, and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well.
Yes, we've had a long-term algorithm that says, how do we grow store count in the 2% to 3%, how do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times and maybe faster in these recessionary environments, how do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to share -- to do share repurchases that push us in and around double-digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time. You remember, Michael, we had, I think, 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. So that's still long term, generally, the model that we believe.
However, we've had the most incredible 6 straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is. I would have thought we would have experienced that by now. I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growth over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought 6 and 12 months ago. But what -- so we may have a slowdown at some point, but I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any.
You ask, would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages? And I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate while we make sure we get great returns. And I think any organization that's running roughly a 40% ROIC, we've proven that we know how to leverage our capital structure.
Jamere, anything that you would say differently? Or do you want to address this last point?"

We have the luxury of having in this environment a faster-growing business with higher margin dollars overall. And I would argue this is a more sustainable way to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value.
What doesn't change in the -- about the algorithm is the most important part of the algorithm, which is this is a business that is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash that enables us to grow our business and return a significant amount of cash to shareholders over time. So as we've gone through this period and we see an opportunity to accelerate the growth in our commercial business by creating a faster-growing business overall, it's ultimately meaning that we're a more profitable company on a dollar basis. And that's going to lead to more cash, and we're going to grow the business and return a significant chunk of that to shareholders.
So long term, what I've been saying is that while the geography changes a little bit, the algorithm at the bottom line doesn't change. This is a business that generates a ton of cash and has tremendous firepower to grow and return cash to shareholders."

But what I will say to you is that this is a pretty dynamic market and that there are always pricing opportunities and cost increases that are coming our way. Our teams have done a tremendous job of managing this mix such that we've historically found ways to have margin accretion when we go through this environment. And the most important part of that is that this is an industry that has been disciplined and rational, and we expect this to continue. So we don't expect, ultimately, for the cost increases to be a margin drag over the business.

So what you can expect from us is that we'll continue to push to drive margin expansion in our business overall. Commercial will be a drag, but we'll continue to work on things from a productivity standpoint. And naturally, you may see some of that impact our EBIT margins. But from a total EBIT dollar standpoint, we'll be in pretty good shape, and it will be a great story.

Our focus, whether it's 19% or 20%, is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return.

If you look at our business in the quarter, our retail business, our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10% during the depths of the crisis, and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that. I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not. And then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation, and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time.
The bigger question is the one that you're bringing up. If we continue to see significant inflation across the market, does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low-end consumer? And ultimately, do we see a deceleration as a result of that? And I think that's a logical thesis, but we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition."

And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. You talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers, our business is up 25% or more since the pre-pandemic level. Our supply chain, our manufacturers and their supply chains, nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. Our teams have done a really, really, really good job of managing through it.
That said, we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time, and they'll go down a little bit, and they'll come up a little bit. But we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis.
To your point, are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future? And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do, we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects, we're playing a little bit of Whack-A-Mole. In the beginning, it was particular categories, sand paper. Now it's tools and brake rotors. We also -- back in the summertime, we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai to the U.S. Now it's, can we get them through the ports in the U.S.? And our team has been really creative about getting the ships but now also finding different ports across the country to go to.
So we are seeing it get better, but we are nowhere out of the woods on seeing that next month, we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year, which is always a difficult time in any supply chain, so it will be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring, early summer, we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought, okay, this one is easing, there's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges."

I talked in my prepared remarks, we're going to make the most significant investments that we've seen in our supply chain because we've seen this surge in volume. And I don't want to spook everybody. Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million, $150 million kind of range over last year. And -- but we'll have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years.
And as we've talked about as a team, think over the long term, we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point. When you've been through a surge in volume like we've experienced over the last 20 months, that was probably a little penny wise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments.
We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last 4 years, from inventory assortments to Mega-Hubs and Hubs, to investments in the Duralast brand, to investments in price, investments in technology. The single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it, but we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business.
So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today, we're looking at are there other places that we can invest?
I also want to say one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done it nearly at the same level is we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture through things like emergency time off. The last time I tallied up what we'd invested from emergency time off, vaccine incentives and those kinds of things, we were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this, if we're going to have values that we state it's imperative that we live consistent with those values, and I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic.
So before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022.
Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care."
