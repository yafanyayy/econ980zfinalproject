I'll provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter performance on Slide 2, and Patrick will provide more color. In short, no surprises. Sales were up 2% on a reported basis, flat organically, as residential HVAC remained very strong with a 25% year-over-year increase. We produced $453 million of adjusted operating profit, executing on the cost actions that we planned and communicated, including accelerated growth investment, incremental public company costs and some onetime items that Patrick will cover. And we are very pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter. Excluding the Beijer tax payment of $272 million, we would have exceeded our forecast by about $100 million. 
Importantly, we continue to consistently execute on our long-term strategic growth agenda while maintaining strong traction on our Carrier 700 and G&A-cost reduction initiatives. All of this positions us well for 2021 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 3. Before we dive into 2021, let me provide a broader look back at 2020. I look at 2020 as both a foundational and a transformational year for Carrier. With the spin from UTC, it was clear that we had a unique opportunity to create tremendous value. But to do so, we needed to create a new Carrier. We started with our culture and took an intentional and deliberate approach to launching the Carrier Way. Our culture reinforces our value and is centered around customers, agility, innovation, talent and winning, and the energy level within Carrier is tremendous. 
In addition to culture, we have invested in and promoted existing employees while infusing the team with key outside talent who have brought fresh perspectives and proven leadership. 
We also launched several new initiatives designed to further enhance the agility and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we launched Carrier Excellence, our new operating system; Carrier Alliance, our new supply chain program; and we undertook a holistic and structural approach to driving sustained G&A reductions and simplicity across the business. 
We put a disciplined process in place to drive $600 million of recurring cost savings over 3 years, Carrier 600. And given our strong progress, we recently increased our target to $700 million under the renamed Carrier 700. 
We also dramatically improved the balance sheet since spin. We now have increased financial flexibility to invest in growth, execute bolt-on M&A and return capital to shareholders. In December, we announced a 50% increase in the dividend, and today, we announced the share repurchase program. And we leaned into becoming ESG leaders, committing to significant, achievable and important goals, such as by 2030, reducing our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton and achieving carbon-neutrality in our operations, commitments that are not only good for the environment but also good for business. 
We also made progress on our profound commitment to improving our diversity representation in creating a truly inclusive culture. And we reframed our focus to position Carrier as a growth company. 
While the COVID pandemic in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges, it also served to reinforce our position as the world leader in healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. With this as our enterprise strategy, supplemented by our 3-pillar approach to driving sustained growth, we are confident in our top line opportunities for 2021 and beyond. 
Slide 4 shows the flywheel that I used in our last earnings call to help explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. As COVID shine a light on the criticality of healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chains, we acted on our ambition to become a world leader in both. There has been a tectonic shift in how business, government and society value the safety of indoor environments and the importance of ROAS systems for distributing food and medicine. There has also been a groundswell of recent focus on sustainability, all of which represent opportunities for Carrier's business now and in the future. 
On the building side, we introduced new products like our OptiClean unit that Time magazine recognized as a top innovation of 2020. More recently, as part of our healthy home strategy, we introduced an air purifier for the home. This is our first direct-to-consumer product focused on improving air quality. And we also are now selling Carrier 1-inch filters directly to consumers. Overall, we have over $100 million of orders for healthy building products and services and have a pipeline of more than $200 million. 
The next milestone is the release of a new digital solution that we're calling Abound that will work with building management systems to provide visibility to indoor air quality and other key healthy building indicators. Using machine learning, this solution will connect to building control systems and auto mitigate efficiencies. The overall goal is to work with our customers to give their patrons and tenants confidence to reenter indoor environments. 
As an example, we recently signed a sponsorship with the American Hotel and Lodging Association, where Carrier will help define the AHLA Safe Stay guidelines for guests and staff around indoor air quality and contactless solutions, and then we'll play our part to help hotels implement those solutions. 
On the Refrigeration side, we continue to see traction on connected cold chain offerings that address the critical challenges inherent to food and pharmaceutical distribution. Sales at our industry-leading cargo monitoring Sensitech business were up about 10% in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2021 with a backlog that is up over 170% over the same period last year. And we continue to push for adoption of our cloud-based Lynx platform that we are codeveloping with AWS to extend our current digital offerings. 
Our growth levers are further fueled by delivering against our 3 strategic pillars. First, in terms of growing the core, we can say with confidence that we gain share in many of our core markets. We met our objective of adding over 500 sales and sales support people, invested over $400 million in R&D, enabling to introduce over 120 new products last year. 
We continue to have key new wins. Our team never needed to be pushed to win just given the freedom and the investments needed to get back to our market-leading routes. We also continue to push on product extensions, such as VRF and geographic coverage, with a focus on increasing sales in China. 
Our third pillar, growing services and digital, has yielded very strong initial results as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. To kickstart progress, we focused last year on our conversion rates. That is converting new OEM units coming off warranty to long-term agreements. We started the year at 20% conversion rates. We committed to end the year at 30%, and we did. 
Going forward, our focus will be on overall coverage. That is, of our overall installed base of chillers in the market, how many of those are under some sort of long-term agreement. Today, we have coverage of about 50,000 units, and our plan is to increase that by about 10,000 units per year. We have similar objectives in other parts of our business as well. 
Increased coverage is enabled by digital solutions. Our truck/trailer segment launched eSolutions 2.0 with a web-based dashboard that provides critical fleet information, enhanced visibility and improved geo fencing. And in F&S, we launched our Edwards EST 4 network fire alarm and emergency communications platform to tie multiple remote buildings together to provide more flexibility and cost-effective solutions to our customers. 
We also continue to invest in and grow our ALC building automation and controls business, where customers have embraced our open architecture solutions. 50% of our 2020 sales in that business came from recently introduced products. And we are complementing that with continued investments in our channel and field network. 
Formats culture and our growth mindset, we are taking a very disciplined approach to capital allocation. In the span of just 9 months, we reduced our net debt from about $10 billion to approximately $7 billion and ended the year with over $3 billion of cash. 
Our balance sheet improvement now opens the door to bolt-on M&A. Our acquisitions will align with our focus on healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and more broadly with the 3 pillars of growth that we have laid out. 
Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me give you some color on how we're thinking about 2021 on Slide 5. Our outlook for the year reflects our objective being a consistent mid-single-digit organic growth company. We expect sales to grow 6% to 8%, and that includes 2% tailwind from FX. And with strong conversion, we expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 14% at the midpoint. We'll continue to invest in growth, while we project improving margins by about 70 basis points and producing strong free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. 
While we are starting this year with continued uncertainty around the global economic recovery as the pandemic continues to impact people and economies around the world, we are optimistic that the uncertainty will subside as we get into the second half of the year following more widespread vaccine distribution. The good news for our first half is that our backlog is solid given the strength in orders in 4Q that has continued very well into January. 
As we get into the second half of the year, we expect some of the businesses that were acutely challenged by the pandemic to start to recover, particularly in retail, hospitality, and small- to medium-sized businesses. 
So with that, let me now turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"
620281,701330338,2200410,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today and very excited to be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last 2 months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us.",1685,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today and very excited to be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last 2 months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us. I see tremendous opportunities to create value given our focus on innovation, accelerating profitable growth, driving internal efficiencies, free cash flow generation and capital deployment and portfolio management. I will sharpen this focus and drive execution so we can continue to deliver long-term superior financial returns to shareowners. 
Let me share some detail around the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave discussed, Q4 was broadly in line with our outlook. As you can see on the right side, we exceeded the outlook we gave you in October for sales and adjusted operating profit. Sales of $4.6 billion were up 2% versus the prior year and flat organically. Currency was a 2-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $100 million, but with little profit contribution. The sales growth was driven by continued strength in our residential HVAC business, which was up 25% in the quarter. 
We saw continued sequential improvement across our other businesses. As expected, adjusted operating profit of $453 million was down versus the prior year as Carrier 700 cost savings were more than offset by the reversal of some temporary cost actions related to COVID-19, the expected $75 million of investments, about $25 million of incremental public company costs and about $50 million of onetime items in the quarter. These onetime items were about $20 million higher than we expected and included a pre-spin vendor contract termination and legal and related costs. 
Free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter included $272 million in tax payments related to the sale of the Beijer shares. We anticipated $50 million to $60 million of that from the September sale, but the remainder associated with the December transaction was not captured in our October outlook. 
Moving on to the full year. Sales of $17.45 billion were above our most recent outlook of about $17.3 billion due to currency translation. Full year adjusted operating profit was $2.23 billion, just over our October guidance. And excluding the tax payment for the sale of Beijer shares, we would have exceeded our free cash flow target by about $100 million. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 7. HVAC organic sales were up 4% in the quarter driven by the 25% increase in residential. As expected, field inventory levels have now normalized, and we should see more typical growth trends in that business going forward but recognize there will be a much easier compare in the first half versus the second half of 2021. Commercial HVAC sales were down mid-single digits organically. Light commercial was down 10% and continued to lag but the rate of decline improved sequentially. 
Turning to Refrigeration. Sales of $949 million were down 3% on an organic basis but improved sequentially. This was by far the best quarter from a year-over-year perspective for the segment. 
Organic sales of the Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially in Q4 and were down 5% compared to last year. We saw a 6% decline in the product business and a 2% decrease in the field business. Within the product businesses, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained challenging. 
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the fourth quarter because that is important to understand what is driving our 2021 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong orders driven by residential. We intentionally worked with our channel partners to exit 2020 with more normalized inventory levels. Backlog in residential is up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments in the first half of 2021. 
Commercial HVAC orders were about flat compared to last year, and we exited 2020 with backlog up mid-teens year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North American truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up about 10%. Container orders up almost 50%, pointing to a recovery in 2021. Commercial Refrigeration orders were up mid-teens organically as the business is also seeing pent-up demand. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting the year position the Refrigeration segment for the strongest growth of the 3 segments in 2021. 
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were down low single digits. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and global access solutions remain weak. Field orders were up double digits year-over-year, and we exited 2020 with record backlog for installations in this business. Overall, a generally improving order trend gives us confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in 2021. 
Please turn to Slide 9 as I walk you through our 2021 outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we expect reported sales to be up 6% to 8%. We expect organic growth of 4% to 6% and a currency translation tailwind of about 2%. We expect HVAC and Fire & Security organic growth to be low to mid-single digits and expect Refrigeration to be up low teens. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by about 70 basis points at the midpoint to around 13.5%. 
We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 25%, 1 point lower than last year. And adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95. This represents about 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. We expect about $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which represents about 95% conversion despite higher capital spending and about $100 million more in interest payments. 
Moving to Slide 10. Let's walk through the thesis in our 2021 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS growth will come almost entirely from operational performance as the increased volume converts to earnings. Core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency, the 2020 Beijer sale and the 2020 Q4 items, is about 30%. We anticipate additional benefits from Carrier 700 of about $225 million in 2021 and expect the absence of COVID-related inefficiencies and disruptions in our factories and supply chain to benefit us by about $125 million. Offsetting that is about $200 million of cost-containment snapback and about $150 million of planned incremental investments. 
We previously talked about the 3-year plan as $100 million of investment in each year of 2020, 2021 and 2022. We are accelerating some investments into 2021 and therefore currently expect incremental investments in 2022 to be only $50 million. We expect the net impact of pricing and input costs to be neutral for the year. Interest expense will be a headwind in 2021. We raised most of the debt in late February 2020, so we did not have an entire year's worth of interest expense last year. 
Lastly, we currently have some restrictions in our debt covenants, our total number of shares we can repurchase. And so while we target repurchasing about 5 million shares in 2021, the average number of shares used for EPS in 2021 will still be above 2020. And so that represents about a $0.02 headwind '21 versus '20. Page 16 of the slide deck includes some additional items related to our 2021 outlook. 
Let's shift focus to the balance sheet and our leverage profile on Slide 11. Carrier completed the spin in April with substantial leverage. Since that time, we've been able to reduce leverage significantly through strong free cash flow performance and the sale of our stake in Beijer. We repaid the entire $1.75 billion term loan in the fourth quarter. And net debt adjusted EBIT -- and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from about 3.4 at the time of the spin down to about 2.8 at the end of fiscal 2020. We expect 2021 year-end net debt just north of $6 billion, which would bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio closer to 2.1 by the end of 2021. That is assuming no impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. 
The bottom line is that we're in a much stronger position today given the improved health of our balance sheet, which provides more flexibility with respect to capital deployment. 
That takes us to Slide 12. During 2020, it was clear that the focus had to be on reducing leverage. As we enter 2021, we plan a more balanced capital deployment while remaining within our overall capital structure of an investment-grade credit rating. We expect 2021 CapEx to be about $375 million. 
Dave talked about some of our priorities with respect to inorganic investments. We're not putting a dollar amount placeholder here, but we will be opportunistic on bolt-on M&A that help achieve our strategic objectives and meet our financial criteria. We plan to reduce debt by $500 million in 2021, and in light of our pending redemption, we will not have any debt maturing until 2025. 
And in December, we announced a dividend increase, and we now expect 2021 dividend payments to amount to about $425 million. And today, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of $350 million, and our outlook for '21 incorporates repurchasing about 5 million shares this year. 
Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just add that the volatile quarters in 2020 should lead to some unusual comparisons in 2021. We expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat organic performance in the second half given the residential comparisons. In addition, we expect the first quarter to have the lowest incremental margins for the year, probably in the high teens, due to having more Beijer income in last year's Q1 than other quarters, a larger currency conversion headwind and some prior year deferred comp favorable items. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave."

Number two is we are seeing traction in our whole focus on indoor air quality, healthy buildings. We have a pipeline of $200 million there. So it's clearly a watch item, particularly North America. I was pleased -- china has continued to be strong. Europe we actually saw coming back. You may recall earlier in '20, I felt like we weren't gaining the share in Europe that we had been in North America, China.

Now the good thing is backlog for service and aftermarket was up double digits for us in the quarter. So that bodes well for future periods. 
Other items that impacted the HVAC margins in the quarter. One, you referred to investments. Investments were up $75 million in the quarter for the overall company. HVAC saw the vast majority of that. And so that, together with the one-timers that I referred to earlier, is really the story around HVAC margins. For next year, we expect for the full year HVAC margins to be close to 16%."

We also invested in R&D. That was a big chunk of it. We had tapped the brakes a little bit on some of our investments in 2Q. We started to release it in 3Q and to 4Q. So we did accelerate R&D investments. And also, the third piece is digital. A little bit less than the R&D side, but we're going to come out with some new digital products here at the beginning of the second quarter, especially tied into healthy buildings. So we really try to lean forward because that's what we see as one of the most transformational opportunities. It has to be -- it has to do with a digital offering that's going to be an extraction layer that has -- that gives customers visibility into things like indoor air quality.

But you look at that we have a relatively small percentage of our, say, chillers under some form of long-term agreement. It's less than 25%. And the reality is it should be something that's exponentially higher. One of the ways to do it is having those chillers be connected. So we're going out of our way to add edge devices to the chiller. So we can have more of a 2-way communication with the customer, so we cannot only do things like diagnostics and prognostics -- diagnostics and prognostics but other value-added services, such as energy efficiency through making the devices connected. So connecting the devices is one. 
Adding the salespeople is another key one. One of the reasons we were successful in our conversion rates last year was simply putting people in the building, working with the building operator to say, while it's under warranty or while it's under an agreement with someone else, there's value-added services that we can provide. So increasing our sales forces in a very targeted way. 
So for example, in China, at some of the Tier 2 cities, in the North America in some of the underserved regions that we have today. So really, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. I am very confident in the double-digit aftermarket growth this year."

I mean it actually caught us a bit by surprise because it had been quite negative in the second and third quarter. Even places like India, we started to see traction; other places, Singapore, Australia. Hong Kong is still a mixed bag because of a multitude of reasons there. But we were pleasantly surprised by some of the traction we started to see in parts of Asia outside of China. 
And look, China is just remained just continuously strong really across the portfolio: on the cold chain side, both in commercial refrigeration and transport refrigeration. Overall, look at Carrier, our China -- in the fourth quarter, China sales were up 10%. Orders were up about 5% in China. Particularly strong in Refrigeration, where it was up about 20%. So we remain very, very bullish on China overall, and it was nice to see progress in Southeast Asia, but it's still a watch item. We got to see more vaccine distribution in places like India, and then we'll get more confidence on the sustainability."

We do expect working capital overall to be a slight tailwind. On the headwinds associated with free cash flow, we expect comp and benefits to be a little bit of a headwind there in fiscal '21.

So the ability to turn that in an effective way has been positive and a bit easier than it has been on the aftermarket for us because it hasn't traditionally been as big of a focus area for us as it has been perhaps for a couple of our peers that have done well in this area. 
So I would say on the aftermarket, we added a new Head of Aftermarket, Ajay Agrawal. He's been working tightly with the new heads of aftermarket that we put in place in the BUs and the BU Presidents. And now we put in place a playbook that we know works, but it's not a playbook that you can affect overnight. So adding the sales and sales support people, adding a BlueEdge-tiered offering, adding digital offerings that can really differentiate the overall offerings. 
So a lot of this playbook of how we think about pricing parts and how we can provide more value-added services to our customers, that playbook is in the process of being rolled out. But when we talk about a 20% increase in our chiller coverage this year, that's a pretty big percentage. And a lot of 2020 was putting that foundation in place. 2021 for us is the show-me year.

I'll provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter performance on Slide 2, and Patrick will provide more color. In short, no surprises. Sales were up 2% on a reported basis, flat organically, as residential HVAC remained very strong with a 25% year-over-year increase. We produced $453 million of adjusted operating profit, executing on the cost actions that we planned and communicated, including accelerated growth investment, incremental public company costs and some onetime items that Patrick will cover. And we are very pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter. Excluding the Beijer tax payment of $272 million, we would have exceeded our forecast by about $100 million. 
Importantly, we continue to consistently execute on our long-term strategic growth agenda while maintaining strong traction on our Carrier 700 and G&A-cost reduction initiatives. All of this positions us well for 2021 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 3. Before we dive into 2021, let me provide a broader look back at 2020. I look at 2020 as both a foundational and a transformational year for Carrier. With the spin from UTC, it was clear that we had a unique opportunity to create tremendous value. But to do so, we needed to create a new Carrier. We started with our culture and took an intentional and deliberate approach to launching the Carrier Way. Our culture reinforces our value and is centered around customers, agility, innovation, talent and winning, and the energy level within Carrier is tremendous. 
In addition to culture, we have invested in and promoted existing employees while infusing the team with key outside talent who have brought fresh perspectives and proven leadership. 
We also launched several new initiatives designed to further enhance the agility and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we launched Carrier Excellence, our new operating system; Carrier Alliance, our new supply chain program; and we undertook a holistic and structural approach to driving sustained G&A reductions and simplicity across the business. 
We put a disciplined process in place to drive $600 million of recurring cost savings over 3 years, Carrier 600. And given our strong progress, we recently increased our target to $700 million under the renamed Carrier 700. 
We also dramatically improved the balance sheet since spin. We now have increased financial flexibility to invest in growth, execute bolt-on M&A and return capital to shareholders. In December, we announced a 50% increase in the dividend, and today, we announced the share repurchase program. And we leaned into becoming ESG leaders, committing to significant, achievable and important goals, such as by 2030, reducing our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton and achieving carbon-neutrality in our operations, commitments that are not only good for the environment but also good for business. 
We also made progress on our profound commitment to improving our diversity representation in creating a truly inclusive culture. And we reframed our focus to position Carrier as a growth company. 
While the COVID pandemic in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges, it also served to reinforce our position as the world leader in healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. With this as our enterprise strategy, supplemented by our 3-pillar approach to driving sustained growth, we are confident in our top line opportunities for 2021 and beyond. 
Slide 4 shows the flywheel that I used in our last earnings call to help explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. As COVID shined a light on the criticality of healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chains, we acted on our ambition to become a world leader in both. There has been a tectonic shift in how business, government and society value the safety of indoor environments and the importance of robust systems for distributing food and medicine. There has also been a groundswell of recent focus on sustainability, all of which represent opportunities for Carrier's business now and in the future. 
On the building side, we introduced new products like our OptiClean unit that Time Magazine recognized as a top innovation of 2020. More recently, as part of our healthy home strategy, we introduced an air purifier for the home. This is our first direct-to-consumer product focused on improving air quality. And we also are now selling Carrier 1-inch filters directly to consumers. Overall, we have over $100 million of orders for healthy building products and services and have a pipeline of more than $200 million. 
The next milestone is the release of a new digital solution that we're calling [ Abound ] that will work with building management systems to provide visibility to indoor air quality and other key healthy building indicators. Using machine learning, this solution will connect to building control systems and auto mitigate deficiencies. The overall goal is to work with our customers to give their patrons and tenants confidence to reenter indoor environments. 
As an example, we recently signed a sponsorship with the American Hotel & Lodging Association, where Carrier will help define the AHLA Safe Stay guidelines for guests and staff around indoor air quality and contactless solutions, and then we'll play our part to help hotels implement those solutions. 
On the Refrigeration side, we continue to see traction on connected cold chain offerings that address the critical challenges inherent to food and pharmaceutical distribution. Sales at our industry-leading cargo monitoring Sensitech business were up about 10% in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2021 with a backlog that is up over 170% over the same period last year. And we continue to push for adoption of our cloud-based Lynx platform that we are codeveloping with AWS to extend our current digital offerings. 
Our growth levers are further fueled by delivering against our 3 strategic pillars. First, in terms of growing the core, we can say with confidence that we gain share in many of our core markets. We met our objective of adding over 500 sales and sales support people, invested over $400 million in R&D, enabling to introduce over 120 new products last year. 
We continue to have key new wins. Our team never needed to be pushed to win, just given the freedom and the investments needed to get back to our market-leading routes. We also continue to push on product extensions, such as VRF and geographic coverage, with a focus on increasing sales in China. 
Our third pillar, growing services and digital, has yielded very strong initial results as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. To kickstart progress, we focused last year on our conversion rates. That is converting new OEM units coming off warranty to long-term agreements. We started the year at 20% conversion rates. We committed to end the year at 30%, and we did. 
Going forward, our focus will be on overall coverage. That is, of our overall installed base of chillers in the market, how many of those are under some sort of long-term agreement. Today, we have coverage of about 50,000 units, and our plan is to increase that by about 10,000 units per year. We have similar objectives in other parts of our business as well. 
Increased coverage is enabled by digital solutions. Our truck/trailer segment launched eSolutions 2.0 with a web-based dashboard that provides critical fleet information, enhanced visibility and improved geo fencing. And in F&S, we launched our Edwards EST4 network fire alarm and emergency communications platform to tie multiple remote buildings together to provide more flexibility and cost-effective solutions to our customers. 
We also continue to invest in and grow our ALC building automation and controls business, where customers have embraced our open architecture solutions. 50% of our 2020 sales in that business came from recently introduced products. And we are complementing that with continued investments in our channel and field network. 
Performance culture and our growth mindset, we are taking a very disciplined approach to capital allocation. In the span of just 9 months, we reduced our net debt from about $10 billion to approximately $7 billion and ended the year with over $3 billion of cash. 
Our balance sheet improvement now opens the door to bolt-on M&A. Our acquisitions will align with our focus on healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and more broadly with the 3 pillars of growth that we have laid out. 
Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me give you some color on how we're thinking about 2021 on Slide 5. Our outlook for the year reflects our objective being a consistent mid-single-digit organic growth company. We expect sales to grow 6% to 8%, and that includes 2% tailwind from FX. And with strong conversion, we expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 14% at the midpoint. We'll continue to invest in growth, while we project improving margins by about 70 basis points and producing strong free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. 
While we are starting this year with continued uncertainty around the global economic recovery as the pandemic continues to impact people and economies around the world, we are optimistic that the uncertainty will subside as we get into the second half of the year following more widespread vaccine distribution. The good news for our first half is that our backlog is solid given the strength in orders in 4Q that has continued very well into January. 
As we get into the second half of the year, we expect some of the businesses that were acutely challenged by the pandemic to start to recover, particularly in retail, hospitality, and small- to medium-sized businesses. 
So with that, let me now turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"
620281,701330338,2200634,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today and very excited to be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last 2 months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us.",1686,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today and very excited to be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last 2 months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us. I see tremendous opportunities to create value given our focus on innovation, accelerating profitable growth, driving internal efficiencies, free cash flow generation and capital deployment and portfolio management. I will sharpen this focus and drive execution so we can continue to deliver long-term superior financial returns to shareowners. 
Let me share some detail around the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave discussed, Q4 was broadly in line with our outlook. As you can see on the right side, we exceeded the outlook we gave you in October for sales and adjusted operating profit. Sales of $4.6 billion were up 2% versus the prior year and flat organically. Currency was a 2-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $100 million, but with little profit contribution. The sales growth was driven by continued strength in our residential HVAC business, which was up 25% in the quarter. 
We saw continued sequential improvement across our other businesses. As expected, adjusted operating profit of $453 million was down versus the prior year as Carrier 700 cost savings were more than offset by the reversal of some temporary cost actions related to COVID-19, the expected $75 million of investments, about $25 million of incremental public company costs and about $50 million of onetime items in the quarter. These onetime items were about $20 million higher than we expected and included a pre-spin vendor contract termination and legal and related costs. 
Free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter included $272 million in tax payments related to the sale of the Beijer shares. We anticipated $50 million to $60 million of that from the September sale, but the remainder associated with the December transaction was not captured in our October outlook. 
Moving on to the full year. Sales of $17.45 billion were above our most recent outlook of about $17.3 billion due to currency translation. Full year adjusted operating profit was $2.23 billion, just over our October guidance. And excluding the tax payment for the sale of Beijer shares, we would have exceeded our free cash flow target by about $100 million. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 7. HVAC organic sales were up 4% in the quarter driven by the 25% increase in Residential. As expected, field inventory levels have now normalized, and we should see more typical growth trends in that business going forward but recognize there will be a much easier compare in the first half versus the second half of 2021. Commercial HVAC sales were down mid-single digits organically. Light commercial was down 10% and continued to lag but the rate of decline improved sequentially. 
Turning to Refrigeration. Sales of $949 million were down 3% on an organic basis but improved sequentially. This was by far the best quarter from a year-over-year perspective for the segment. 
Organic sales of the Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially in Q4 and were down 5% compared to last year. We saw a 6% decline in the product business and a 2% decrease in the field business. Within the product businesses, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained challenging. 
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the fourth quarter because that is important to understand what is driving our 2021 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong orders driven by residential. We intentionally worked with our channel partners to exit 2020 with more normalized inventory levels. Backlog in residential is up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments in the first half of 2021. 
Commercial HVAC orders were about flat compared to last year, and we exited 2020 with backlog up mid-teens year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North American truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up about 10%. Container orders up almost 50%, pointing to a recovery in 2021. Commercial Refrigeration orders were up mid-teens organically as the business is also seeing pent-up demand. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting the year position the Refrigeration segment for the strongest growth of the 3 segments in 2021. 
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were down low single digits. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and global access solutions remain weak. Field orders were up low double digits year-over-year, and we exited 2020 with record backlog for installations in this business. Overall, a generally improving order trend gives us confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in 2021. 
Please turn to Slide 9 as I walk you through our 2021 outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we expect reported sales to be up 6% to 8%. We expect organic growth of 4% to 6% and a currency translation tailwind of about 2%. We expect HVAC and Fire & Security organic growth to be low to mid-single digits and expect Refrigeration to be up low teens. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by about 70 basis points at the midpoint to around 13.5%. 
We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 25%, 1 point lower than last year. And adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95. This represents about 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. We expect about $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which represents about 95% conversion despite higher capital spending and about $100 million more in interest payments. 
Moving to Slide 10. Let's walk through the thesis in our 2021 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS growth will come almost entirely from operational performance as the increased volume converts to earnings. Core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency, the 2020 Beijer sale and the 2020 Q4 items, is about 30%. We anticipate additional benefits from Carrier 700 of about $225 million in 2021 and expect the absence of COVID-related inefficiencies and disruptions in our factories and supply chain to benefit us by about $125 million. Offsetting that is about $200 million of cost-containment snapback and about $150 million of planned incremental investments. 
We previously talked about the 3-year plan as $100 million of investment in each year of 2020, 2021 and 2022. We are accelerating some investments into 2021 and therefore currently expect incremental investments in 2022 to be only $50 million. We expect the net impact of pricing and input costs to be neutral for the year. Interest expense will be a headwind in 2021. We raised most of the debt in late February 2020, so we did not have an entire year's worth of interest expense last year. 
Lastly, we currently have some restrictions in our debt covenants on the total number of shares we can repurchase. And so while we target repurchasing about 5 million shares in 2021, the average number of shares used for EPS in 2021 will still be above 2020. And so that represents about a $0.02 headwind '21 versus '20. Page 16 of the slide deck includes some additional items related to our 2021 outlook. 
Let's shift focus to the balance sheet and our leverage profile on Slide 11. Carrier completed the spin in April with substantial leverage. Since that time, we've been able to reduce leverage significantly through strong free cash flow performance and the sale of our stake in Beijer. We repaid the entire $1.75 billion term loan in the fourth quarter. And net debt adjusted EBIT -- and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from about 3.4 at the time of the spin down to about 2.8 at the end of fiscal 2020. We expect 2021 year-end net debt just north of $6 billion, which would bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio closer to 2.1 by the end of 2021 that is assuming no impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. The bottom line is that we're in a much stronger position today given the improved health of our balance sheet, which provides more flexibility with respect to capital deployment. 
That takes us to Slide 12. During 2020, it was clear that the focus had to be on reducing leverage. As we enter 2021, we plan a more balanced capital deployment while remaining within our overall capital structure of an investment-grade credit rating. We expect 2021 CapEx to be about $375 million. 
Dave talked about some of our priorities with respect to inorganic investments. We're not putting a dollar amount placeholder here, but we will be opportunistic on bolt-on M&A that help achieve our strategic objectives and meet our financial criteria. We plan to reduce debt by $500 million in 2021, and in light of our pending redemption, we will not have any debt maturing until 2025. 
In December, we announced a dividend increase, and we now expect 2021 dividend payments to amount to about $425 million. And today, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of $350 million, and our outlook for '21 incorporates repurchasing about 5 million shares this year. 
Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just add that the volatile quarters in 2020 should lead to some unusual comparisons in 2021. We expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat organic performance in the second half given the residential comparisons. In addition, we expect the first quarter to have the lowest incremental margins for the year, probably in the high teens, due to having more Beijer income in last year's Q1 than other quarters, a larger currency conversion headwind and some prior year deferred comp favorable items. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave."

Number two is we are seeing traction in our whole focus on indoor air quality, healthy buildings. We have a pipeline of $200 million there. So it's clearly a watch item, particularly North America. I was pleased -- China has continued to be strong. Europe we actually saw coming back. You may recall earlier in '20, I felt like we weren't gaining the share in Europe that we had been in North America, China. The team made a number of changes in Europe, and we're seeing traction there. 
So signs of life in Europe, orders were up about 5% there in the fourth quarter. Asia Pacific actually showing a bit of strength towards the end of last year for the first time in 8 or 9 months. So signs of progress, but clearly, a couple of watch items, probably the biggest being North American new construction."

Service and aftermarket was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. They tend to have better margins.

So we're going out of our way to add edge devices to the chiller. So we can have more of a 2-way communication with the customer, so we cannot only do things like diagnostics and prognostics but other value-added services, such as energy efficiency through making the devices connected. So connecting the devices is one. 
Adding the salespeople is another key one. One of the reasons we were successful in our conversion rates last year was simply putting people in the building, working with the building operator to say, while it's under warranty or while it's under an agreement with someone else, there's value-added services that we can provide. So increasing our sales forces in a very targeted way. 
So for example, in China, at some of the Tier 2 cities, in the North America in some of the underserved regions that we have today. So really, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. I am very confident in the double-digit aftermarket growth this year."

We announced our price increase during the normal cycle, which is early in our first quarter. 
And then from a blocking or locking point of view, currently, over 75% of our 2021 requirements are locked or blocked. If prices stay high, of course, this could be a watch item for 2022. But we'll be continuing to look at this closely and looking, of course, at continued recovery through pricing as well. So overall, neutral for fiscal '21."

Now part of it is that you know that we have a good position with new home construction. That was up about 8% last year. We expect it to continue to be strong this year. But we're working very closely with our channel partners to make sure that we're giving them what they need, when they need it.

So we expect that the backlog in orders that carry us through the first half, clearly, you have the compares. But as you get in the second half, there's pent-up demand in some of the key verticals that have been acutely challenged. So our light commercial business, we start -- we would expect to see recovery as we get into the second half of this year. 
You start looking at some parts of our Fire & Security business that were hurt by small- and medium-sized businesses and the impact of retail and some of the big-box retail impacts that we've seen.

There is significant demand in the channel. I would say that one thing that is positive is that we have gained share. It's always complicated when you look at share on a quarter-to-quarter basis with all the different moving parts on selling either direct to dealers or selling through independent distribution. But if you just step back and look at 2020 as a whole, our resi sales were up 10%, and you're looking at probably a market that was up 7% to 8%. So we feel positive that we're gaining share the right way. Our partnership with our distribution partners has been very positive.

There are 2 items that are large offsets. You mentioned one of them. Interest payable is -- we will make an extra $100 million of interest payments. And in CapEx, we expect also to be up about $65 million. And so that offsets most of the adjusted net income. 
We do expect working capital overall to be a slight tailwind. On the headwinds associated with free cash flow, we expect comp and benefits to be a little bit of a headwind there in fiscal '21. But those are the biggest pieces. It's really higher adjusted income, offset by $100 million extra interest payment and $65 million additional CapEx.

But I know you're still sort of working your way up the curve on service market share. Is there something about, either the timing of being able to actually schedule that or the nature of the service you guys are winning, that would suggest that there's sort of a lag? Just curious that that building access phenomenon, I suspect, is kind of similar for everybody, and that seems to be impacting you more, but you're doing better on equipment.

It's not really putting a new machine, a new construct in place. It was really accelerating, doing what we know how to do with more focus and energy. So the ability to turn that in an effective way has been positive and a bit easier than it has been on the aftermarket for us because it hasn't traditionally been as big of a focus area for us as it has been perhaps for a couple of our peers that have done well in this area. 
So I would say on the aftermarket, we added a new Head of Aftermarket, Ajay Agrawal. He's been working tightly with the new heads of aftermarket that we put in place in the BUs and the BU Presidents. And now we put in place a playbook that we know works, but it's not a playbook that you can affect overnight. So adding the sales and sales support people, adding a BlueEdge-tiered offering, adding digital offerings that can really differentiate the overall offerings. 
So a lot of this playbook of how we think about pricing parts and how we can provide more value-added services to our customers, that playbook is in the process of being rolled out. But when we talk about a 20% increase in our chiller coverage this year, that's a pretty big percentage. And a lot of 2020 was putting that foundation in place. 2021 for us is the show-me year. And now we got to kind of go realize a lot of that foundation that we put in place last year."

Starting on Slide 2 with an overview of the quarter. Q1 was a great quarter for us and an early indication that a global economic recovery is underway. Areas of our portfolio that have been performing well have",1320,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2 with an overview of the quarter. Q1 was a great quarter for us and an early indication that a global economic recovery is underway. Areas of our portfolio that have been performing well have continued to improve, and those businesses and verticals that were acutely impacted by the pandemic are showing early indications of recovery.
Overall, volume came in stronger than we planned. Reported sales were up over 20%, including organic growth of 17% driven by another very strong quarter in North American Residential, which was up 50%. We also saw strong growth in commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. All of our segments contributed to the organic growth in Q1 as the organization continued to execute well on our growth initiatives, including the aftermarket, which grew close to double digits.
Notably, Compared to the first quarter of 2019, we grew sales about 6% organically. This was coupled with strong order trends leading to a healthy backlog at the end of the quarter. Orders were up over 30% compared to last year, driving the organic backlog up 13% sequentially and up close to 20% year-over-year. We produced $608 million of adjusted operating profit, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Given supply chain constraints, we are incurring some additional inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs and meeting customer demand. We are working to mitigate these headwinds through additional cost and pricing actions.
Finally, I am encouraged by our free cash flow generation in the first quarter. Though we do not expect to regularly adjust guidance for the full year after just 1 quarter, we are increasing guidance on sales, earnings and free cash flow given our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and confidence in the macro trends that we're seeing. We now expect reported sales to grow 7% to 10%, including a 2% tailwind from FX. We expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 20% at the midpoint, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow for the year by about $100 million to about $1.7 billion.
Slide 3 shows the flywheel that I've used in prior earnings calls to explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. In the upper left, we continue to ensure that we drive a performance culture. We are now 1 year into our journey as a stand-alone public company, and we are building momentum. We started off by putting a playbook in place and a year later, I can say that we are a fundamentally different company from our culture to our strategy to our targeted investment prioritization, balance sheet and capital position.
Carrier 700 is the cornerstone of our unrelenting focus on cost reduction, and we achieved about $60 million in Q1 in a tough environment. Increased input costs and are putting pressure on our $225 million target for the year, so we are driving additional cost and price actions to offset the unplanned headwind.
Also, core to our new culture is a focus on profitable growth. We are gaining traction on all 3 pillars of our growth strategy. We are gaining share across the portfolio helped by innovation arising from our increasing R&D spend from $400 million in 2019 to about $475 million this year and an additional 600 sales and sales support people that we've added over the past 9 months.
Regarding aftermarket and digital offerings, we are gaining significant traction as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. We are on track to deliver double-digit aftermarket growth this year, and we continue to expect a number of chillers under contract to increase from 50,000 to 60,000 this year. Increased service coverage and traction on our BlueEdge offerings are enabled by our digital solutions that we are implementing across all of our segments.
Lastly, we continue to take a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, which Patrick will cover. We also said that we would continue to invest in solutions for healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and inorganic growth, both of which I'll discuss on Slide 4.
In Q1, we had over $80 million of orders for healthy building products and services, and we currently have a global pipeline of sales opportunities of more than $500 million. We created a new healthy building solutions organization under Ajay Agrawal leadership with a seasoned team dedicated to this effort.
We also introduced differentiated sought-after offerings and we're energized by this week's release of our new digital offering called Abound. It is all about giving customers confidence to reenter crowded indoor environments and providing a healthier indoor experience. Abound gathers performance data from disparate systems, sensors and sources and present it in a smart, simple interface. It gives a clear view of building systems and sensor performance data and identifies and helps to address anomalies.
This solution is not a simple rebranding of digital offerings that we had in our portfolio. It is an open architecture SaaS, cloud-based platform and acts as an intelligence layer interfacing with not only our automated logic controls platform, but also with third-party building management systems and sensors throughout the building. We have had pilots underway with key vertical customers in the office building space, the educational sector and the sports and entertainment vertical. Those have gone tremendously well. A huge vote of confidence is that we signed a deal to support the Atlanta Braves as they start to welcome fans back to Truist Park. Abound will monitor the indoor space covering a range of food and beverage locations and club spaces for guests.
As a SaaS platform, Abound is expected to drive more recurring revenues, including subscription and services and also to help pull through additional Carrier equipment sales. We are seeing equally strong progress on our other key ecosystem of focus, healthy, safe and sustainable cold-chain solutions.
Sensitech our cargo monitoring business had a record Q1 with sales up 16% due in large part to demand related to the distribution of COVID vaccines.
Similar to Abound, a key differentiator is our cloud-based digital offering that we are building in partnership with AWS called Lynx. As a key launch customer, CQ recently selected the Lynx fleet solution to deliver enhanced digital capabilities for 2,000 refrigerated containers.
And finally, on the right side of the chart, we highlight our inorganic growth progress. We were very pleased to announce our agreement to acquire GWA, which we refer to by its brand name of Tigo. This acquisition will help accelerate our growth in the attractive variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets, which have consistently had outsized growth rates over traditional markets.
With the acquisition of Tigo, we will own important BRF technology, design capabilities and low-cost manufacturing that we can scale globally. We expect to close the transaction with a majority shareholder in 2Q and we are excited to welcome the Tigo team to the Carrier family.
We also continue to add and promote superb talent as we lean into the deployment of the Carrier way. As an example, we recently welcomed Jennifer Anderson the Carrier, leading corporate development strategy and serving as our Chief Sustainability Officer. She will help drive another key strategic focus, ESG. ESG remains a very important focal point for Carrier as we work toward delivering on our 2030 commitments. We are tracking to our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton, as we introduce more energy-efficient and electric solutions.
Last week, Carrier improved to a top quartile score with Sustainalytics, and we are now #5 within the building products category out of 129 companies. And we also continue to make good progress on our D&I initiatives. Our number of diverse executives has increased significantly since 2015, and we are leaning in to making sustainable changes to ensure that we have a truly inclusive culture.
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick."

Please turn to Slide 5. As Dave discussed, Q1 was a great start to the year. Sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. Currency was a 4-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million",1451,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Dave discussed, Q1 was a great start to the year. Sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. Currency was a 4-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million.
On the top line, We saw a return to year-over-year organic growth in almost all of our businesses in Q1, and all 3 segments exceeded their organic growth expectations for the quarter. Organic sales growth of 17% was significantly better than we expected, and March was particularly strong across our businesses.
Adjusted operating profit was up 39% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 170 basis points. Strong sales growth and benefits from the Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments. Results also included some higher freight costs and a product trouble issue at a minority JV. Price cost in the quarter was about neutral. Earnings conversion was better than the high teens I shared with you in February driven by the stronger-than-expected sales performance.
We delivered 21% conversion despite the onetime items we previously discussed. The loss of buyer related income, the impact of deferred and equity compensation and lower conversion on currency. Excluding these items, conversion was about 30% in the quarter.
Free cash flow of $131 million in the quarter mainly reflected better-than-expected net income and improved working capital performance. During the quarter, we repurchased about 976,000 shares at an average cost of $38.40 per share.
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 6. HVAC organic sales were up 25% in the quarter, driven by the 48% residential growth. Distributor movement was very strong at about 20%, and we believe there was some earlier-than-expected seasonal inventory build in the channel. Commercial HVAC sales were up in the mid-teens organically. Strong growth in Applied and service more than offset continued lower volume in North America light commercial, which was down mid-single digits. Light commercial order rates were up over 10% in the quarter, and field inventory levels are down over 30% compared to last year, positioning this business for a strong Q2. The HVAC team expanded margins by 240 basis points, driven by growth in residential and in services. The segment remains on track to generate about 16% margins this year.
Over to Refrigeration on Slide 7. Sales were up 19% organically, as the cyclical recovery in transport that we've seen in orders has started to materialize in sales. Transport refrigeration was up 22% in the quarter, driven by over 40% growth in container and truck/trailer recovery, particularly in Europe and Asia. North America truck/trailer grew high single digits with each month improving. Commercial refrigeration grew low double digits as pent-up demand and reopenings in Europe drove strong growth. Margins were up 50 basis points in the quarter compared to last year. We continue to meet customer demand, but are incurring some higher costs due so, including airfreight. We expect operating margins to improve as growth in the higher-margin North America truck trailer business accelerates.
Flipping to Slide 8. Organic sales at the Fire & Security segment grew 3% and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of this segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid while Access Solutions in our industrial businesses remain challenging. Of note, the product business saw a significant pickup in the month of March, leading to a strong end of the quarter.
Our field business, Chubb, generated organic sales growth of about 4%. The growth was largely driven by Europe and other -- and order rates were strong, especially in Asia. As you can see on the slide, Chubb booked its largest installation order ever. Strong Carrier 700 performance helped drive a 220 basis point margin improvement in this segment.
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the first quarter on Slide 9. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and is still up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments entering Q2 and the cooling season. Commercial HVAC orders were up high teens compared to last year and backlog increased over 10% compared to the last -- compared to last quarter in that business.
For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North America truck trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up over 50%. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting Q1 should position the Refrigeration segment to achieve closer to high teens organic sales growth for the year.
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were up 5% year-over-year with a strong end to the quarter, especially in residential and commercial fire. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and the hospitality vertical remain weak, but comparisons get better in Q2. Field orders were up about 15% organically as activity begins to pick up in Europe and against an easier Asia comp. Installation orders were solid, and we continue to have a record backlog.
Let's walk through the EPS bridge on Slide 10. As I mentioned, Q1 EPS of $0.48 was $0.13 higher than prior year, and the growth comes largely from operational performance, as you can see on the bridge. Strong sales growth is the main driver here as well as Carrier 700 savings of about $60 million. Operational performance was also impacted by some of the headwinds I referred to earlier, including higher freight costs and the product trouble at a minority JV.
While inflationary pressures continue, we're working to offset this through additional cost and pricing actions. We recently announced a second price increase in our residential HVAC business for June as well as an increase in transport refrigeration, and we're implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio. The loss of buyer related income and the year-over-year impact of deferred and equity comp was about a $0.03 headwind in the quarter. All the other items on the bridge are pretty much in line with what we expected, except for the favorable tax item, which will carry through the year.
Let's move to Slide 11, updated outlook. Based on stronger-than-expected Q1 performance and an improving outlook, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 4% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%. A bit less than 0.5 point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs. We continue to expect price cost to be about neutral for the year. We expect our adjusted operating margin now could be a bit over 13.5%. The Q1 favorable discrete tax item means that our full year tax rate should now be around 24% rather than 25%. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $1.95 to $2.05, a $0.10 improvement at the midpoint from our initial guidance. Our updated outlook does not include the Tigo transaction. Finally, as Dave mentioned, we now expect free cash flow of about $1.7 billion.
Slide 12 shows the bridge for the $0.10 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the midpoint of our current guidance range. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on the additional sales volume. Lower interest expense and the tax item are each adding about $0.02.
Over to Slide 13, where I'll reiterate our capital allocation priorities for 2021. There are no changes to our priorities since the Q4 call, but you have started to see us execute on some of these items. During Q1, we paid down $500 million of long-term debt and with the transactions that have closed or have been announced to date, capital deployment on M&A will exceed $200 million this year. Last week, we declared a quarterly dividend. And on share repurchases, we are making progress towards our target for 5 million shares this year.
Before I turn it back to Dave, Let me just reiterate that the volatile quarters in 2020 should continue to impact the comparisons in 2021. We still expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat in the second half given the residential comparisons. We expect about half of the full year earnings to be in the first half. So a good start to the year puts us in a position to raise our full year outlook across the board.
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave."

For the full year, we expect reported conversion to be closer to 25%. Adjust that for buyer and currency and the onetime items from last year, we get to 30% for the full year.

And for the full year, as I mentioned, closer to 25% earnings conversion reported operationally closer to 30%.
In terms of the investments, We did about $40 million in the first quarter. I think it will be pretty much evenly split throughout the year. And so I don't expect big swings from an investment point of view throughout the quarter. I think you also asked about the input costs compared to our prior guidance. In our prior guidance with several tens of millions of dollars of incremental headwinds from inflation in the current guide that went up by another $70 million or so, so $70 million. And our current guide assumes that we're offsetting that with about $70 million of incremental pricing.
And so from a timing point of view, for the full year, price/cost will remain neutral. In the second quarter, that may be the 1 quarter where price/cost is a little bit unfavorable."

A little less than half of that relates to incremental pricing. That gives you, give or take, $70 million. $70 million of incremental pricing that we've assumed in our current guidance, which offset the $70 million incremental headwind on input costs that I referred to earlier.
The balance of the increase in organic growth for the full year is really in HVAC, both resi and commercial. Some of that, of course, includes that price and in transport refrigeration. Those are the areas where we've really pushed up our outlook for the year in terms of organic growth."

There's this designation that it should go for air quality improvement, AC system improvement.

You look at the $1.9 trillion stimulus package $130 billion of that went towards school reopening. And then if you look at the President's new proposed infrastructure build, the American Jobs plan, it includes an additional $100 billion for schools. So how and when that gets spent will remain to be seen. Obviously, it needs to flow from the federal to the state to the local school districts. But it's significant because The GAO had a report that said 40% of the school districts have insufficient HVAC. So when you look at that potential $230 billion of spend, we think a material amount of that will go towards upgrading the HVAC systems because it's long overdue, and it's needed.
K-12 is an important part of our business. It represents about 10% of our sales in North America in Applied and light commercial. We've come out with very targeted kit offering, which makes it easy for the 16,000 school districts across the country. to make a selection and move quickly to implement it. We have a dedicated sales team. We have innovative solutions that we've now come forward with things like a bound in our OptiClean solutions. And we also think it's important because these are sustainable solutions. So how it plays out this year and next, you will have to see the specifics, but we do think this will provide us with multiyear tailwind for our HVAC business."

We do think that it's going to be hard to track quarter-to-quarter. You almost have to step back and look at the full year. I think what we're going to see is normal growth rates for the year with abnormal calendarization. So what we saw in the first quarter was sales up 50%. And what we're looking at for the first half is sales probably up around 35% in the first half.
And then given the very difficult compare given the strength we had in the second half of last year, the second half is probably down closer to 20%. So we're raising -- we had originally thought the year would be low to mid-single digits. It's clearly looking like it's in the mid-single-digit range for the year, which is not an abnormal kind of year.
What's really encouraging is that movement was very strong in the first quarter. It was up over 20%, and movements continue to be strong here in 2Q. Now the inventory levels, as you said, they're higher than normal. They're at 30% year-over-year. But having said that, If movement continues to stay at the pace that we've been seeing it, we think that we would end Q2 inventory levels probably 10% to 15% higher than 2019, which is a better compare, which is not completely abnormal.
Housing starts continue to be very strong. They'll be up 11%, 12% this year, and we're seeing continued pent-up demand. And a lot of the strength we saw or at least a material amount of strength we saw in the first quarter was furnaces, which would not really indicate for a lot of prestocking and inventory.
So look, we're going to have to keep an eye on it, of course, because third quarter was up 50%, fourth quarter, up 25%, this quarter, up 50%. But we continue to take share, we continue to support our customers, we continue to see strong movement. So we feel well positioned certainly in 2Q, and then we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out."

So there's challenges out there. I'm really proud of the operations team. I think they're managing it best-in-class, but it's certainly not without its challenges. But I think the things you mentioned were actually tried to get out in front. And 1 of the things that I think has helped us is as we saw this demand coming, we actually pre-stock some inventory.

We were pleased with the growth in Europe. Europe was up in the mid-teen range. North American equipment was a watch item. We did have a couple of very short-term issues in 1 of our factories that probably is a short-term issue. So we'll catch up with that here in 2Q. So North American equipment for us was actually down a bit. And the aftermarket in North American was up double digits. So I think the North American equipment is poised for a nice recovery, especially when you look at the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index.
We looked at 11 months below 50, and it got as low as 29. But now we've been above 50. And in March, it was at 55, which is very, very good level. So of course, a big leading indicator of commercial construction activity. So we're very encouraged about what we're seeing in the applied space in North America, especially in the verticals like data centers and warehouses, education, which I mentioned on the stimulus package and then health care. So -- and we continue to lean into aftermarket growth, which we anticipate will be up double digits and the backlog is strong.
Light commercial, it was down a bit. It sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. So every quarter, light commercial has been getting better. But as restaurants and retail start to open up, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with order trends. So it's really set up for nice growth. We were thinking that light commercial would be up mid-single digits. It's probably going to be up around 10% this year.
And what we're seeing In light commercial is strong order trends. We're seeing improved backlogs. I mean it's not -- it's obviously a very easy compare, but the backlog is up 100%.

And the issue that we had is we really did not -- we didn't have design capabilities, and we were not really a manufacturer. And that's not what we are as an OEM. We're not a distributor.
So this was one of the few but important plays that we could make to become a design and manufacturing VRF player with a great operation there outside of Guangzhou in China. So very, very pleased. It gets us to become a more meaningful player. We've been clear that we do have partnerships with folks like Toshiba, with Media that we're very proud of. I mean these go back decades and they're great partners. Are there opportunities to more optimize those into win-win relationships?

When we sell upgrades that are really driven by filtration or UV lights, we put that in there. And we're really, really excited about the new abound offering. Bobby, George and the team have been working on this with almost a skunkworks type group over the last 6 months or so to come out with a differentiated digital offering. And that will be a big enabler for healthy buildings because what it will do is it will make it visible to the end consumer, how safe and healthy is the indoor environment.
We think about it like an Intel Inside strategy where you started to have end consumers ask for certain chips in their PCs. What we're going to see is certain consumers having expectations that before they make a restaurant reservation or go into a commercial office building or come back into crowded indoor spaces, they're going to have an expectation that they can see the health of the indoor environment, and that the building manager is taking steps to mitigate any anomalies with that. And that's exactly what Abound will enable. So we will put a balanced subscription sales in the healthy building category as well."

Yes, I mean one of our big themes for Carrier since we spun has been focus and simplification. So if you think about our JV portfolio, we started with 4 minority JVs, and we'll end this year closer to 32%. So we have been taking a very clinical approach to reducing the number of JVs for various reasons. There are some that really pose risk, but not a lot of value to the overall business. So we have reduced some of those. And then there are some that we still have that we are in discussions to reframe them a bit, especially if it's in a very strategic area for us, and we're not consolidating sales or EBIT, that's an area that we're in discussions with our partners on.
With respect to the specific product issue that wasn't one of our minority JVs. I wish I could say that in things we control, we've never had our own product issues. So we're not disparaging the JV because of that 1 issue, but it does highlight that we do want to have more controls in place in some of our critically strategic areas."

So clearly, education, K-12 is a key focus area, but even universities. We've been in discussions with universities as they look at -- they're very -- they have a very broad footprint at most of the universities in the United States, but globally as well. Health care and hospital is a key focus area for us as well. Commercial office buildings as people reimagine the future of work and various models there. They do want to make sure that as people come back into the office to providing a safe indoor environment. Stadiums, I mentioned the deal with the Braves, but we are optimistic that, that would be the first of other deals we would do.
So anywhere where you have kind of people in a somewhat crowded indoor environment, they're starting to be more discussions. I had dinner with a friend who owns restaurants a couple of weeks ago, and he wants to add OptiClean units for his various restaurants. So we're seeing a lot of interest. The question we get a lot is going to be how sticky is it? We know that sustainability is a sticky theme. In healthy, once the pandemic is more under control globally, well, healthy buildings be a thing of the past. And I think that especially when you think about our abound offering, that is one of the keys to really making sure that this is a sticky trend for years to come. Because what it's taught us is that COVID isn't the first airborne-transmitted disease, and it won't be the last. And people are much more in tune with having safe into our environment. So to make it visible to them and then you ultimately use AI and ML to anticipate and correct any deficiencies with indoor environments. I do think this is a trend that will withstand the test of time."

The second element, this is for Fire & Security, we saw a very strong end to the quarter in March. And so it's quick-turn business. We have not updated our full year outlook for that segment at this point. And so we're taking another card there. In terms of profitability. Full year, as I said, $70 million more of price, offsetting $70 million more of a headwind and then a little bit more volume leverage from what we raised. We did dial in a little bit more of the air freight costs as well for the full year. So that's kind of the -- a little bit more detail and color around the full year outlook."

And then what you're seeing is we had anticipated that in previous down cycles, what you would have seen is more repair over replacement. We actually haven't seen any of that. We've actually seen a lot more replacement of entire units, entire condensing units or entire systems. And I think it's because -- partly because there's more stay at home and partly because there's more liquidity in this down cycle than we saw in previous. So people are prioritizing the spend they have on their homes, and we're also seeing people buy a lot of new homes. And often when you buy a new home, one of the things you do in your inspection is look at the HVAC system. So that's probably driving some of it. But what we're hearing, we were actually on the phone recently last week with a key distributor down in the Texas area. And they said that they're very encouraged by what they're seeing from their contractors. They're encouraged by Carrier's ability. It's not that we haven't had our hiccups, but our ability to support them, and I think that's helped some of the share gains that we've seen.

Q1 was a great quarter for us and an early indication that a global economic recovery is underway. Areas of our portfolio that have been performing well have continued to improve, and those businesses and verticals that were acutely impacted by the pandemic are showing early indications of recovery.
Overall, volume came in stronger than we planned. Reported sales were up over 20%, including organic growth of 17% driven by another very strong quarter in North American residential, which was up 50%. We also saw strong growth in commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. All of our segments contributed to the organic growth in Q1 as the organization continued to execute well on our growth initiatives, including the aftermarket, which grew close to double digits.
Notably, compared to the first quarter of 2019, we grew sales about 6% organically. This was coupled with strong order trends leading to a healthy backlog at the end of the quarter. Orders were up over 30% compared to last year, driving the organic backlog up 13% sequentially and up close to 20% year-over-year. We produced $608 million of adjusted operating profit, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Given supply chain constraints, we are incurring some additional inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs and meeting customer demand. We are working to mitigate these headwinds through additional cost and pricing actions.
Finally, I am encouraged by our free cash flow generation in the first quarter. Though we do not expect to regularly adjust guidance for the full year after just 1 quarter, we are increasing guidance on sales, earnings and free cash flow given our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and confidence in the macro trends that we're seeing. We now expect reported sales to grow 7% to 10%, including a 2% tailwind from FX. We expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 20% at the midpoint, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow for the year by about $100 million to about $1.7 billion.
Slide 3 shows the flywheel that I've used in prior earnings calls to explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. In the upper left, we continue to ensure that we drive a performance culture. We are now 1 year into our journey as a stand-alone public company, and we are building momentum. We started off by putting a playbook in place and a year later, I can say that we are a fundamentally different company from our culture, to our strategy, to our targeted investment prioritization, balance sheet and capital position.
Carrier 700 is the cornerstone of our unrelenting focus on cost reduction, and we achieved about $60 million in Q1 in a tough environment. Increased input costs and -- are putting pressure on our $225 million target for the year, so we are driving additional cost and price actions to offset the unplanned headwind.
Also, core to our new culture is a focus on profitable growth. We are gaining traction on all 3 pillars of our growth strategy. We are gaining share across the portfolio helped by innovation arising from our increasing R&D spend from $400 million in 2019 to about $475 million this year and an additional 600 sales and sales support people that we've added over the past 9 months.
Regarding aftermarket and digital offerings, we are gaining significant traction as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues. We are on track to deliver double-digit aftermarket growth this year, and we continue to expect a number of chillers under contract to increase from 50,000 to 60,000 this year. Increased service coverage and traction on our BlueEdge offerings are enabled by our digital solutions that we are implementing across all of our segments.
Lastly, we continue to take a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, which Patrick will cover. We also said that we would continue to invest in solutions for healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and inorganic growth, both of which I'll discuss on Slide 4.
In Q1, we had over $80 million of orders for healthy building products and services, and we currently have a global pipeline of sales opportunities of more than $500 million. We created a new healthy building solutions organization under Ajay Agrawal leadership with a seasoned team dedicated to this effort.
We also introduced differentiated sought-after offerings and we're energized by this week's release of our new digital offering called Abound. It is all about giving customers confidence to reenter crowded indoor environments and providing a healthier indoor experience. Abound gathers performance data from disparate systems, sensors and sources and presents it in a smart, simple interface. It gives a clear view of building systems and sensor performance data and identifies and helps to address anomalies.
This solution is not a simple rebranding of digital offerings that we had in our portfolio. It is an open architecture SaaS, cloud-based platform and acts as an intelligence layer interfacing with not only our automated logic controls platform, but also with third-party building management systems and sensors throughout the building.
We have had pilots underway with key vertical customers in the office building space, the educational sector and the sports and entertainment vertical. Those have gone tremendously well. A huge vote of confidence is that we signed a deal to support the Atlanta Braves as they start to welcome fans back to Truist Park. Abound will monitor the indoor space covering a range of food and beverage locations and club spaces for guests.
As a SaaS platform, Abound is expected to drive more recurring revenues, including subscription and services and also to help pull through additional Carrier equipment sales. We are seeing equally strong progress on our other key ecosystem of focus, healthy, safe and sustainable cold-chain solutions.
Sensitech, our cargo monitoring business, had a record Q1 with sales up 16% due in large part to demand related to the distribution of COVID vaccines.
Similar to Abound, a key differentiator is our cloud-based digital offering that we are building in partnership with AWS called Lynx. As a key launch customer, SeaCube recently selected the Lynx fleet solution to deliver enhanced digital capabilities for 2,000 refrigerated containers.
And finally, on the right side of the chart, we highlight our inorganic growth progress. We were very pleased to announce our agreement to acquire Giwee, which we refer to by its brand name of Chigo. This acquisition will help accelerate our growth in the attractive variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets, which have consistently had outsized growth rates over traditional markets.
With the acquisition of Chigo, we will own important BRF technology, design capabilities and low-cost manufacturing that we can scale globally. We expect to close the transaction with a majority shareholder in 2Q and we are excited to welcome the Chigo team to the Carrier family.
We also continue to add and promote superb talent as we lean into the deployment of the Carrier way. As an example, we recently welcomed Jennifer Anderson to Carrier, leading Corporate Development, Strategy and serving as our Chief Sustainability Officer. She will help drive another key strategic focus, ESG. ESG remains a very important focal point for Carrier as we work toward delivering on our 2030 commitments. We are tracking to our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton, as we introduce more energy-efficient and electric solutions.
Last week, Carrier improved to a top quartile score with Sustainalytics, and we are now #5 within the building products category out of 129 companies. And we also continue to make good progress on our D&I initiatives. Our number of diverse executives has increased significantly since 2015, and we are leaning in to making sustainable changes to ensure that we have a truly inclusive culture.
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick."
620281,711123874,2263201,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Dave discussed, Q1 was a great start to the year. Sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. Currency was a 4-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million",1441,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Dave discussed, Q1 was a great start to the year. Sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. Currency was a 4-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million.
On the top line, we saw a return to year-over-year organic growth in almost all of our businesses in Q1, and all 3 segments exceeded their organic growth expectations for the quarter. Organic sales growth of 17% was significantly better than we expected, and March was particularly strong across our businesses.
Adjusted operating profit was up 39% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 170 basis points. Strong sales growth and benefits from the Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments. Results also included some higher freight costs and a product trouble issue at a minority JV. Price/cost in the quarter was about neutral. Earnings conversion was better than the high-teens I shared with you in February driven by the stronger-than-expected sales performance.
We delivered 21% conversion despite the onetime items we previously discussed. The loss of buyer-related income, the impact of deferred and equity compensation and lower conversion on currency. Excluding these items, conversion was about 30% in the quarter.
Free cash flow of $131 million in the quarter mainly reflected better-than-expected net income and improved working capital performance. During the quarter, we repurchased about 976,000 shares at an average cost of $38.40 per share.
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 6. HVAC organic sales were up 25% in the quarter, driven by the 48% residential growth. Distributor movement was very strong at about 20%, and we believe there was some earlier-than-expected seasonal inventory build in the channel.
Commercial HVAC sales were up in the mid-teens organically. Strong growth in applied & service more than offset continued lower volume in North America light commercial, which was down mid-single digits. Light commercial order rates were up over 10% in the quarter, and field inventory levels are down over 30% compared to last year, positioning this business for a strong Q2. The HVAC team expanded margins by 240 basis points, driven by growth in residential and in services. The segment remains on track to generate about 16% margins this year.
Over to Refrigeration on Slide 7. Sales were up 19% organically, as the cyclical recovery in transport that we've seen in orders has started to materialize in sales. Transport refrigeration was up 22% in the quarter, driven by over 40% growth in container and truck/trailer recovery, particularly in Europe and Asia.
North America truck/trailer grew high single digits with each month improving. Commercial refrigeration grew low double digits as pent-up demand and reopenings in Europe drove strong growth. Margins were up 50 basis points in the quarter compared to last year. We continue to meet customer demand, but are incurring some higher costs to do so, including airfreight. We expect operating margins to improve as growth in the higher-margin North America truck/trailer business accelerates.
Flipping to Slide 8. Organic sales at the Fire & Security segment grew 3% and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the products business, which represents about 60% of this segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remain challenging. Of note, the product business saw a significant pickup in the month of March, leading to a strong end of the quarter.
Our field business, Chubb, generated organic sales growth of about 4%. The growth was largely driven by Europe and other, and order rates were strong, especially in Asia. As you can see on the slide, Chubb booked its largest installation order ever. Strong Carrier 700 performance helped drive a 220 basis point margin improvement in this segment.
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the first quarter on Slide 9. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and is still up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments entering Q2 and the cooling season. Commercial HVAC orders were up high-teens compared to last year and backlog increased over 10% compared to the last -- compared to last quarter in that business.
For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. North America truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and Europe was up over 50%. Strong order intake and backlogs exiting Q1 should position the Refrigeration segment to achieve closer to high-teens organic sales growth for the year.
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were up 5% year-over-year with a strong end to the quarter, especially in residential and commercial fire. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and the hospitality vertical remain weak, but comparisons get better in Q2. Field orders were up about 15% organically as activity begins to pick up in Europe and against an easier Asia comp. Installation orders were solid, and we continue to have a record backlog.
Let's walk through the EPS bridge on Slide 10. As I mentioned, Q1 EPS of $0.48 was $0.13 higher than prior year, and the growth comes largely from operational performance, as you can see on the bridge. Strong sales growth is the main driver here as well as Carrier 700 savings of about $60 million. Operational performance was also impacted by some of the headwinds I referred to earlier, including higher freight costs and the product trouble at a minority JV.
While inflationary pressures continue, we're working to offset this through additional cost and pricing actions. We recently announced a second price increase in our residential HVAC business for June as well as an increase in transport refrigeration, and we're implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio. The loss of buyer-related income and the year-over-year impact of deferred and equity comp was about a $0.03 headwind in the quarter. All the other items on the bridge are pretty much in line with what we expected, except for the favorable tax item, which will carry through the year.
Let's move to Slide 11, updated outlook. Based on stronger-than-expected Q1 performance and an improving outlook, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 4% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%. A bit less than 0.5 point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs.
We continue to expect price/cost to be about neutral for the year. We expect our adjusted operating margin now could be a bit over 13.5%. The Q1 favorable discrete tax item means that our full year tax rate should now be around 24% rather than 25%. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $1.95 to $2.05, a $0.10 improvement at the midpoint from our initial guidance. Our updated outlook does not include the Chigo transaction. Finally, as Dave mentioned, we now expect free cash flow of about $1.7 billion.
Slide 12 shows the bridge for the $0.10 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the midpoint of our current guidance range. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on the additional sales volume. Lower interest expense and the tax item are each adding about $0.02.
Over to Slide 13, where I'll reiterate our capital allocation priorities for 2021. There are no changes to our priorities since the Q4 call, but you have started to see us execute on some of these items. During Q1, we paid down $500 million of long-term debt and with the transactions that have closed or have been announced to date, capital deployment on M&A will exceed $200 million this year. Last week, we declared a quarterly dividend. And on share repurchases, we are making progress towards our target for 5 million shares this year.
Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just reiterate that the volatile quarters in 2020 should continue to impact the comparisons in 2021. We still expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat in the second half given the residential comparisons. We expect about half of the full year earnings to be in the first half. So a good start to the year puts us in a position to raise our full year outlook across the board.
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave."

We expect reported conversion to improve from here on out. And so in future quarters, we expect that conversion to improve from the 21% up. And for the full year, as I mentioned, closer to 25% earnings conversion reported operationally closer to 30%.
In terms of the investments, We did about $40 million in the first quarter. I think it will be pretty much evenly split throughout the year. And so I don't expect big swings from an investment point of view throughout the quarter.
I think you also asked about the input costs compared to our prior guidance. In our prior guidance with several tens of millions of dollars of incremental headwinds from inflation in the current guide that went up by another $70 million or so, so $70 million. And our current guide assumes that we're offsetting that with about $70 million of incremental pricing.
And so from a timing point of view, for the full year, price/cost will remain neutral. In the second quarter, that may be the one quarter where price/cost is a little bit unfavorable."

So we have announced price increases in -- throughout our businesses. The timing at which and the exact yield of that, of course, is always a little bit different than the actual announced price increase.
The way you can think about this is of the 1.5 point increase in organic growth for the full year at the midpoint, so going from 5% organic growth to 6.5% organic growth at the midpoint. A little less than half of that relates to incremental pricing. That gives you, give or take, $70 million, 7-0 million, of incremental pricing that we've assumed in our current guidance, which offset the $70 million incremental headwind on input costs that I referred to earlier.
The balance of the increase in organic growth for the full year is really in HVAC, both resi and commercial. Some of that, of course, includes that price and in transport refrigeration. Those are the areas where we've really pushed up our outlook for the year in terms of organic growth."

I think last stimulus, 70% of this might ended up being spending on capital projects, right? There's this designation that it should go for air quality improvement, AC system improvement.

You look at the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, $130 billion of that went towards school reopening. And then if you look at the President's new proposed infrastructure build, The American Jobs Plan, it includes an additional $100 billion for schools.
So how and when that gets spent will remain to be seen. Obviously, it needs to flow from the federal to the state to the local school districts. But it's significant because The GAO had a report that said 40% of the school districts have insufficient HVAC. So when you look at that potential $230 billion of spend, we think a material amount of that will go towards upgrading the HVAC systems because it's long overdue and it's needed.
K-12 is an important part of our business. It represents about 10% of our sales in North America in applied and light commercial. We've come out with very targeted kit offering, which makes it easy for the 16,000 school districts across the country to make a selection and move quickly to implement it.
We have a dedicated sales team. We have innovative solutions that we've now come forward with things like Abound in our OptiClean solutions. And we also think it's important because these are sustainable solutions. So how it plays out this year and next, you will have to see the specifics, but we do think this will provide us with multiyear tailwind for our HVAC business."

We do think that it's going to be hard to track quarter-to-quarter. You almost have to step back and look at the full year. I think what we're going to see is normal growth rates for the year with abnormal calendarization. So what we saw in the first quarter was sales up 50%. And what we're looking at for the first half is sales probably up around 35% in the first half.
And then given the very difficult compare given the strength we had in the second half of last year, the second half is probably down closer to 20%. So we're raising -- we had originally thought the year would be low to mid-single digits. It's clearly looking like it's in the mid-single-digit range for the year, which is not an abnormal kind of year.
What's really encouraging is that movement was very strong in the first quarter. It was up over 20%, and movements continue to be strong here in 2Q. Now the inventory levels, as you said, they're higher than normal. They're at 30% year-over-year. But having said that, if movement continues to stay at the pace that we've been seeing it, we think that we would end Q2 inventory levels probably 10% to 15% higher than 2019, which is a better compare, which is not completely abnormal.
Housing starts continuing to be very strong. They'll be up 11%, 12% this year, and we're seeing continued pent-up demand. And a lot of the strength we saw or at least a material amount of strength we saw in the first quarter was furnaces, which would not really indicate for a lot of prestocking and inventory.
So look, we're going to have to keep an eye on it, of course, because third quarter was up 50%, fourth quarter up 25%, this quarter up 50%. But we continue to take share, we continue to support our customers, we continue to see strong movement. So we feel well positioned certainly in 2Q, and then we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out."

Commodities, we're seeing some headwind there. Of course, input costs from our Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers, we have to manage that. Logistics remain a challenge.
And frankly, we have to manage productivity because there are some labor shortages in places like our Collierville, Tennessee factory, where we're in the process of hiring a few hundred people there and we got to keep up with not only the short-term demand, but the sustained demand that we see coming over the coming quarters.
So there's challenges out there. I'm really proud of the operations team. I think they're managing it best-in-class, but it's certainly not without its challenges. But I think the things you mentioned were actually tried to get out in front. And one of the things that I think has helped us is as we saw this demand coming, we actually prestock some inventory. Patrick and I authorized a bit of inventory in December and then in January to make sure that we had parts that we were going to need some buffer stock in the face of a lot of the demand influx that we were anticipating."

We were very pleased with that mid-teen growth we saw in -- on the commercial applied side. Obviously, China had some easy compares, but sales up there. Sales in China were up over 100%. We were pleased with the growth in Europe. Europe was up in the mid-teen range.
North American equipment was a watch item. We did have a couple of very short-term issues in one of our factories that probably is a short-term issue. So we'll catch up with that here in 2Q. So North American equipment for us was actually down a bit. And the aftermarket in North American was up double digits. So I think the North American equipment is poised for a nice recovery, especially when you look at the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index.
We looked at 11 months below 50%, and it got as low as 29%. But now we've been above 50%. And in March, it was at 55%, which is very, very good level. So of course, a big leading indicator of commercial construction activity. So we're very encouraged about what we're seeing in the applied space in North America, especially in the verticals like data centers and warehouses, education, which I mentioned on the stimulus package and then health care. So -- and we continue to lean into aftermarket growth, which we anticipate will be up double digits and the backlog is strong.
Light commercial, it was down a bit. It sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. So every quarter, light commercial has been getting better. But as restaurants and retail start to open up, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with order trends. So it's really set up for nice growth. We were thinking that light commercial would be up mid-single digits. It's probably going to be up around 10% this year.
And what we're seeing in light commercial is strong order trends. We're seeing improved backlogs. I mean it's not -- it's obviously a very easy compare, but the backlog is up 100%. And what's really encouraging is field inventory levels are down. They're down about 35%. So it's set up for a nice rebound as we get into 2Q and beyond."

So you can imagine the CAGR for VRF is exponentially higher than some of the other markets. And the issue that we had is we really did not -- we didn't have design capabilities, and we were not really a manufacturer. And that's not what we are as an OEM. We're not a distributor.
So this was one of the few but important plays that we could make to become a design and manufacturing VRF player with a great operation there outside of Guangzhou in China. So very, very pleased. It gets us to become a more meaningful player. We've been clear that we do have partnerships with folks like Toshiba, with Midea that we're very proud of. I mean these go back decades and they're great partners.
Are there opportunities to more optimize those into win-win relationships? We frankly believe that there are, and we're in very constructive discussions with those partners, but we see the Chigo acquisition enabling that to not only be a play for China, but for it to being a global play."

The way we tried -- we try to take a very strict and disciplined definition, which is these are sales that we would not have gotten prior to the focus on really healthy buildings. So a lot of the IAQ-type offerings that really became much more prevalent when the pandemic hit, we really put that in the healthy building $500 million pipeline that I talked about. So examples would include OptiClean. We have orders for more than 30,000 OptiClean units, and we put that in the healthy building category.
When we sell upgrades that are really driven by filtration or UV lights, we put that in there. And we're really, really excited about the new Abound offering. Bobby George and the team have been working on this with almost a skunkworks-type group over the last 6 months or so to come out with a differentiated digital offering. And that will be a big enabler for healthy buildings because what it will do is it will make it visible to the end consumer, how safe and healthy is the indoor environment.
We think about it like an Intel Inside strategy where you started to have end consumers ask for certain chips in their PCs. What we're going to see is certain consumers having expectations that before they make a restaurant reservation or go into a commercial office building or come back into crowded indoor spaces, they're going to have an expectation that they can see the health of the indoor environment and that the building manager is taking steps to mitigate any anomalies with that. And that's exactly what Abound will enable. So we will put a balanced subscription sales in the healthy building category as well."

With respect to the specific product issue that wasn't one of our minority JVs, I wish I could say that. In things we control, we've never had our own product issues.

We've been in discussions with universities as they look at -- they're very -- they have a very broad footprint at most of the universities in the United States, but globally as well.
Health care and hospital is a key focus area for us as well. Commercial office buildings as people reimagine the future of work and various models there. They do want to make sure that as people come back into the office to providing a safe indoor environment. Stadiums, I mentioned the deal with the Braves, but we are optimistic that, that would be the first of other deals we would do.
So anywhere where you have kind of people in a somewhat crowded indoor environment, they're starting to be more discussions. I had dinner with a friend who owns restaurants a couple of weeks ago, and he wants to add OptiClean units for his various restaurants. So we're seeing a lot of interest. The question we get a lot is going to be how sticky is it? We know that sustainability is a sticky theme. In healthy, once the pandemic is more under control globally, well, healthy buildings be a thing of the past.
And I think that especially when you think about our Abound offering, that is one of the keys to really making sure that this is a sticky trend for years to come, because what it's taught us is that COVID isn't the first airborne-transmitted disease and it won't be the last. And people are much more in tune with having safe indoor environment.

The second element, this is for Fire & Security. We saw a very strong end to the quarter in March. And so it's quick-turn business. We have not updated our full year outlook for that segment at this point. And so we're taking another card there.
In terms of profitability, full year, as I said, $70 million more of price, offsetting $70 million more of a headwind and then a little bit more volume leverage from what we raised. We did dial in a little bit more of the air freight costs as well for the full year. So that's kind of the -- a little bit more detail and color around the full year outlook."

So we continue to look at all aspects of our current portfolio. We're very, very energized by the playbook we have in place. We have great confidence, as does our Board and our strategic road map. We have our 3 pillars of growth funded by Carrier 700. We had these 2 big ecosystems we're focused on, healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. So we'll continue to look at rounding out those portfolios.
We put our toe in the water with a bolt-on M&A with Chigo, and we'll look at -- obviously, we're looking at others as we go forward.

And then what you're seeing is we had anticipated that in previous down cycles, what you would have seen is more repair over replacement. We actually haven't seen any of that. We've actually seen a lot more replacement of entire units, entire condensing units or entire systems. And I think it's because -- partly because there's more stay at home and partly because there's more liquidity in this down cycle than we saw in previous.
So people are prioritizing the spend they have on their homes, and we're also seeing people buy a lot of new homes. And often when you buy a new home, one of the things you do in your inspection is look at the HVAC system. So that's probably driving some of it. But what we're hearing, we were actually on the phone recently last week with a key distributor down in the Texas area. And they said that they're very encouraged by what they're seeing from their contractors. They're encouraged by Carrier's ability. It's not that we haven't had our hiccups, but our ability to support them, and I think that's helped some of the share gains that we've seen.

It is great to be hosting this call from the Carrier-cooled New York Stock Exchange, and we appreciate the support that we've received from the team here. Please turn to Slide 2. 
Before we discuss the second quarter results, let me address the press release that we issued Tuesday announcing that we signed an agreement to sell our Chubb business to APi Group for an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. To be clear, Carrier's global Fire & Security products business is not part of this transaction and remains an integral part of Carrier's portfolio and our healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building strategy. 
We committed at our Investor Day last year to objectively assess our portfolio and do so through a rigorous application of our strategic and financial priorities. Within our Fire & Security portfolio, our products business is differentiated with leading market positions and attractive margins. Chubb is an industry leader with 13,000 employees that do a great job with installation and maintenance supporting our customers but it is an agnostic business that does not pull through our products and yields lower margins. 
We concluded that Chubb is more strategic to APi Group than it is to us. Divesting Chubb will significantly simplify our business. Chubb represents over 20% of our employees or less than 10% of our adjusted operating earnings. Selling Chubb will increase our focus on our core businesses and enable us to reinvest the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities to create long-term shareholder value. Patrick will discuss in more detail, but our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent: funding organic and inorganic growth, dividends and share buyback within a solid investment-grade credit rating. 
Our intention is to use the cash proceeds and excess cash on the balance sheet for acquisitions, buybacks and debt pay down over 12 to 18 months to help position the company for strategic growth and to generate attractive shareholder returns. The net result will be a new, more focused Carrier with more product differentiation, faster revenue growth, higher margins and higher returns on invested capital. This was an important deal for Carrier, and I want to thank our team and advisers for their tremendous work. Now turning to our Q2 results on Slide 3. 
Q2 was another strong quarter for us. Our growth continues to be fueled by broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and the benefit of our strategic investments. Managing the surge in growth has strained our extended supply chain, but our teams are navigating those challenges well to support our customers. 
You see our progress reflected in our 2Q results. Organic sales were up over 30%. Particularly encouraging was that the growth was strong across our portfolio and that we even grew 7% versus 2Q of 2019. Orders were up about 35% organically compared to last year, driving our backlog up 8% sequentially and up over 20% year-over-year, positioning us well for 3Q and the second half of the year. 
We produced $821 million of adjusted operating profit up over 70% year-over-year. And consistent with what we said during the April earnings call, Q2 incremental margins improved sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow continues to be strong with first half free cash flow up more than 30% over the first half of last year. Given our first half performance, strong backlog and expectations around the balance of the year, we are again raising our full year guidance for sales, earnings and cash. 
We now expect organic sales to grow 10% to 12%, adjusted EPS to increase by about 30% compared to last year, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow by $200 million to about $1.9 billion. Now turning to Slide 4. We remain confident in sustained growth in our end markets and that our new operating system, culture and team performance position us well to lead within our space. Key secular trends are likely to propel sustained growth for our industry. With people spending 90% of their time indoors and increasingly returning to their offices and recreational activities, we see more spend being allocated to the health, safety, comfort and intelligence of indoor environments of all types, from homes to schools to hospitals to commercial office buildings. 
Likewise, the need for safe cold chain solutions has been intensified by the focus on vaccine distribution and the increasing global middle classes demand for more fresh produce and other refrigerated products. And of course, the need for sustainable solutions. Given that the building sector contributes about 40% of carbon emissions and food waste contributes another 10% to 15%, we are confident that spend on sustainability will continue to drive demand for our green solutions. 
We, therefore, remain laser focused on healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, and we are leaning into those trends by executing on our 3-pronged growth strategy: Growing our core, expanding product extensions and increasing recurring revenues through digitally enabled aftermarket offerings. And we are seeing strong progress, as you can see on Slide 5. 
We have booked $250 million in healthy building orders year-to-date, and our active pipeline sits at $500 million. We are confident that spend on healthy buildings is not only sticky but that it will accelerate as building owners will play both defense and offense on behalf of their occupants. Defensive spend is largely focused on defending against the spread of airborne illnesses. For example, 40% of classrooms in the United States have insufficient ventilation and studies show that better ventilation and filtration materially reduced the spread of microscopic particulates like COVID and other illnesses like the flu and common colds. Building owners are also starting to invest in better ventilation to play offense. 
Recent studies have shown that people performed twice as well when the indoor environment is optimized. High CO2 levels, which can occur in crowded classrooms and offices with poor ventilation have been proven to impact brain-based skills while better ventilation and filtration significantly improved cognitive function. Because of the many benefits of healthy indoor air environments, our goal is to make indoor air visible. So good air quality becomes as important and expected as safe drinking water.  Abound is a key enabler to make that happen. 
We received favorable feedback from our key launch customers, which include a commercial office building and an elementary school, and we have deployed it in our company headquarters where we have been demonstrating its power to customers. We are now leveraging our global sales force to deploy Abound and have had significant interest from marquee customers. In addition to Abound, we recently launched a WiFi-enabled Carrier home air purifier with a HEPA-level filter as one of our latest healthy home offerings. We have now sold over 38,000 OptiClean units. On K-12, we have a dedicated team offering [indiscernible] solutions to our customers, resulting in sales to about 15% to 20% more school districts so far this year compared to last year as part of what we expect to be a significant opportunity over the next few years. Similarly, our connected cold chain offerings are gaining traction. Our cloud-based digital Lynx offering that we are building in partnership with AWS was recognized by Fast Company as one of 2021's world-changing ideas. In the container space, we are adding connectivity for thousands of units each month and now can support mixed fleets Carrier and Non-Carrier, thereby increasing our recurring revenues and reducing our customer maintenance and logistic costs. 
We had significant Lynx wins this quarter with truck/trailer, including 1,700 more trailer refrigeration units for [ Prime ] and a 3-year supply agreement with U.K. grocer, Sansbury, for all of its truck and trailer transport refrigeration equipment. CORTIX is Carrier's AI and IoT platform that offers predictive insights, recommendations and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations while minimizing our customers' energy consumption. Currently, over 220,000 pieces of equipment are connected to CORTIX. Digital solutions are helping to drive increased aftermarket and recurring revenues. 
Aftermarket sales for Carrier were up about 20% in Q2 over last year, all helped by our differentiated BlueEdge tiered offerings. Our attachment rate in commercial HVAC was more than 35% in Q2, and we are on track to add another 10,000 chillers to long-term contracts this year from about 50,000 to 60,000. Likewise, in our Refrigeration business, our Europe truck trailer business sold nearly 6,000 BlueEdge service agreements in the first half of the year. 
In addition, our Fire & Security segment continues to expand our key digital offerings. Earlier this year, LenelS2 was featured in the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, and we're excited to work with Apple on providing BlueDiamond mobile credentials in Apple Wallet, on iPhone and Apple Watch. As employees come back to office buildings, this work can increase the profile of access control solutions that help reduce touch points, enhance occupant experience and increased confidence in indoor environments. So very significant progress on healthy, safe and intelligent offerings and recurring revenues. And on Slide 6, you see similar progress on our focus on sustainability. In short,  we are committed to providing environmentally sustainable solutions and our performance over the past year reflects just that. 
We are on track to meet our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton and ensuring our operations are carbon neutral by 2030. Electrification and energy efficiency are major focus areas for us. Commercial heat pumps in Europe and residential heat pumps in North America were both up 20% to 30% in the quarter. Electrification is equally critical to our Refrigeration business. Interest in our Vector eCool unit in Europe remains high and our backlog continues to grow. This is the only 100% electric trailer reefer unit in the market today. 
Our efforts in helping customers reduce emissions and creating more energy-efficient solutions are starting to be reflected in some of our external ratings, including improvements in both our MSCI and Sustainalytics scores in the past year. As you can see on the slide, we are now considered a leader in the industry. So great progress on ESG, which is a fundamental aspect of who we are. So before I turn it over to Patrick, a word on a leadership change that we recently announced. In a couple of weeks, Tim White will join us as President of our Refrigeration segment. 
Tim has been running GE's multibillion-dollar onshore wind business for the Americas region, and he ran key P&Ls within Collins Aerospace that included electric systems, environmental control systems and engine control systems. He is the perfect leader to take this well-positioned business to the next level as we focus on electrification, digitalization and sustainable solutions. I also want to thank David Appel for his tremendous leadership of the segment. We are fortunate to have David moving to Paris where our commercial refrigeration business is headquartered to provide the focus that, that business needs to improve operational, strategic and financial performance. We appreciate David taking on this critical assignment. So with that, let me turn it over to Patrick."

I'll start with comments about the quarter and the outlook and then provide additional color on the Chubb transaction. Please turn to Slide 7. As Dave mentioned, Q2 was a good quarter with sales, operating earnings, adjusted EPS and free cash flow all exceeding our expectations. 
Sales of $5.4 billion were up 37% compared to last year. Currency was a [ 5-point ] tailwind for sales in the quarter or about $200 million and acquisitions, that's mainly [indiscernible], added another point of growth. Given the impact from COVID last year, this quarter obviously had an easy comparison. Nonetheless, organic sales growth of 31% was significantly better than we expected across all our businesses. 
Adjusted operating margin expanded over 300 basis points to 15.1%. Strong sales growth and benefits from Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments and higher input costs. As we expected, price/cost was negative in the quarter given the timing of price and cost increases, Much stronger-than-expected demand, combined with supply chain challenges negatively impacted factory efficiency. It also meant material purchases went beyond block positions. And as a result, we bought some materials and components at spot prices and utilized expedited freight. I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we already announced additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. 
Reported earnings conversion of about 24% improved sequentially, and excluding currency and acquisitions, conversion was in the high 20s. Free cash flow of $482 million in the quarter reflected better-than-expected net income and was similar to last year's second quarter despite $180 million of higher interest and tax payments. Finally, we repurchased about 2 million shares at an average price of $44.33 during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about 3 million shares. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up 32% in the quarter with nearly 35% residential HVAC growth. As we previously said, we expect that residential field inventory levels to finish approximately 10% to 15% higher than the end of Q2 2019. Strong distributor movement of over 20% compared to last year led to field inventories ending the quarter only 7% higher than at the end of Q2 of 2019, a much more balanced inventory level. North American light commercial business saw a significant rebound with sales up over 60% in the quarter. Light commercial field inventory levels are now down just 3% year-over-year. 
Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 20% organically. HVAC team expanded margins by 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses in this segment, including services. The segment remains on track to generate about [ 60% ] adjusted operating margin this year. 
Moving to refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 38% organically as the cyclical recovery in transport that we see in orders continue to convert into sales. Transport refrigeration was up over 40% in the quarter with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. Commercial refrigeration grew about 30% as reopenings in Europe drove strong growth. Margins for this segment were up 320 basis points in the quarter compared to last year, mainly as a result of the higher sales. We continue to meet customer demand but are incurring higher costs to do so, including air freight. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half as the higher-margin North America truck and trailer business recovery continues. Given the higher input costs, we now expect full year 2021 operating margin for this segment to be in the [ mid-13% ] range, a little lower than we previously expected. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales at the Fire & Security segment grew 25%, and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the Products business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid. Given the easier comparisons, access Solutions returned to double-digit growth our industrial businesses were up high single digits. In industrial fire, we saw the recovery for upgrades and retrofits begin in marine services and in the oil and gas markets. Higher sales and Carrier 700 performance helped drive the 140 basis point margin expansion in this segment. With the higher sales outlook and the timing of price and cost actions, we expect higher margins in the back of the year compared to the first half of the year and overall margins to be in the mid-13s for the year. 
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the second quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and points to a better second half than we previously expected. Commercial HVAC orders were up over 30% compared to last year, and backlog increased almost 20% year-over-year and up mid- to high single digits sequentially from last quarter. 
For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. Strong order intake and backlog exiting Q2 should position this segment to achieve the expected high teens organic sales growth for the full year. Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. The product orders were up a bit over 25% year-over-year, especially in residential and commercial fire. Field orders were up 25% to 30%, organic. 
I'll skip Slide 12. So let's move to Slide 13, our updated outlook. To be clear, we will include Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on stronger-than-expected Q2 performance and higher backlogs, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 5% to 8% to a new range of 10% to 12%. A bit more than half a point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs versus our April guidance. Last quarter, we said material and component input costs were about $120 million or so higher than 2020. We now expect those input costs to be up an additional $125 million. 
We intend to offset this through additional pricing actions. We recently announced the third price increase in our residential HVAC business for September as well as a third price increase in transport refrigeration, and we are implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio. Our new outlook includes $125 million of additional pricing compared to our April guidance. For the full year, we expect price cost to be neutral though we expect it to be a modest headwind in Q3, offsetting higher input costs with incremental pricing on a dollar-for-dollar basis protects profitability, but of course, hurts reported margin and conversion. Despite these cost inefficiencies, we now expect to deliver an adjusted operating margin of over 13.5% for the year, better than our previous outlook. Another way to think about the outlook is that the revenues are now expected to be about $1 billion higher than the April guide. Of that, about $125 million is priced to offset increased input costs and about $200 million is acquisition-related sales with little profit contribution this year. The conversion on the remaining $650 million to $700 million of sales approaches the 30% we would normally expect. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $2.10 to $2.20, a $0.15 improvement at the midpoint from our prior guidance. 
We also now expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance. Slide 14 shows a bridge for the $0.15 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guide to the midpoint of our current guidance. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on additional sales. Moving over to Slide 15. I'll provide more details regarding Chubb's transaction. 
You can see a brief profile of Chubb on the left side of the slide. We expect revenues for Chubb to be about $2.2 billion this year with high single-digit operating margins. Excluding Chubb, Carrier's operating margins would be about 50 to 100 basis points higher, free cash flow conversion about 100%, and we would also expect to have a higher growth and modestly higher return on invested capital profile. The remaining Fire & Security segment will include a portfolio of differentiated, high-margin businesses with leading positions in their respective markets. Sales would be about $3.5 billion and operating margin in the high teens. 
With respect to transaction details, the enterprise value is $3.1 billion, and net after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $2.6 billion. As part of the transaction, about 2/3 of Carrier's total pension and post retirement assets and liabilities will be transferred to APi. That is over $2 billion and significantly simplifies and derisks our balance sheet. Related to the pension, we expect most to all of our noncash, nonservice pension benefit on the income statement to go away. While this generates about $70 million in annual earnings, we do not believe it represents any economic value. As customary, the sale is subject to a consultation process and regulatory approvals. Expected close is late Q4 2021 or early Q1 2022. 
As to the use of proceeds, we intend to use the approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds as well as available excess cash for a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. We expect to delever by about $750 million post transaction to maintain our leverage profile commensurate with the EBITDA reduction. We have a growing pipeline of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, and our Board just approved an incremental $1.75 billion share repurchase authorization. 
We will be flexible between share repurchases and acquisitions, and now expect 2021 repurchases to exceed the 5 million shares we previously discussed. In closing, we had a good first half with strong double-digit organic growth. Congratulations to our team in supporting stronger-than-expected demand in a very challenging supply chain environment. With our performance so far, along with a solid order activity and backlog growth, we feel confident meaningfully raising our full year guidance. And the Chubb transaction simplifies our portfolio, enhances management focus, creates a more attractive company profile and generates cash to reinvest in higher share owner value-creating opportunities. With that, I'll turn it back to you, David."

And then the remaining [ $3.5 billion  for ] products you have highly differentiated products, #1 or #2 in all of our segments. It fits well with the whole healthy building trend and the other parts of the HVAC portfolio and the ROS is close to 20%. So very, very strategic, something that we really want to lean into.

So that's the kind of the walk of the $3.1 billion to the $2.6 billion. In terms of free cash flow conversion on Chubb, actually, Chubb was one of the reasons why our cash flow conversion for the overall company was less than 100%. And part of that, of course, gets back to the noncash, nonservice pension benefit we saw in the income statement. That's about $70 million on an annual basis. we don't attribute any economic value to that. That headwind called on free cash flow conversion will go away. I would also add that from an overall company perspective, whether it's from a working capital perspective or an ROIC perspective, Chubb was below the company average. And so without Chubb, all of these metrics, we expect them to improve, including, of course, our operating margin."

So we thought that our inventory levels at the end of 2Q were going to be up 10% to 15% versus the same time at the end of 2019, which is an indicator we have been watching closely. And inventory level in the field for us ended up only up 7% versus the same time in Q2 of 2019. 
And you look at a collection of factors that are driving the strength that we're seeing. Housing starts, it's going to be up 13% or so this year. We are seeing people obviously buying and selling more homes. And one of the things that happens when you buy a home is sometimes you replace the air conditioning system. So I think that's a driver. There's been a lot of talk about work from home, of course, but I think it's -- without being too quantitative about it, it just seems that units are running hotter and longer getting more cycles on them, and that has to be contributing to some of the strength that we're seeing. And we benefited from share gains. I mean we're up -- if you look at the last 12 months, you really can't measure share 1 quarter at a time, but you can look at -- over the last 12 months, our share is up over 200 basis points. 
And it's a combination of converting dealers, but also I do believe that our operational performance, even though we have been far from flawless has helped us, albeit, frankly, at a higher cost, but we've gone out of our way to support our customers. So I think, Steve, you put that all together and as we start looking ahead, we want to -- we expect that when we come out of this year, our inventory levels should be in balance. We're going to carefully watch movement. We have announced our third price increase effective September 1 this year, which was really focused on 2022 as we announced that. And housing starts, we'll have to see how that plays out. The estimates are all over the map, but maybe around that to flattish for right now, but we'll see how that plays out. And then we'll start to see some perhaps early buy because of the 2023 change. You put that all together, I think we're trying to stay very close to our distributors, keep inventory levels in check and continue to support our customers."

So we expect reported conversion to be between 20 and 25 and operational or core conversion to be in the high 20s.

And then the Chigo acquisition, the first year with a lot of revenue and given some of the onetime costs, not a lot of earnings contribution yet. And so that's really the walk between the low 20s and the high 20s from an earnings conversion point of view. And then, of course, what I'm not taking into account here is that as we raise price just to offset some input costs, that's somewhat of a headwind as well. 
For next year, we're really at a point where we can talk a lot about next year. What I can say is that, and I mentioned this before, we have a really strong focus within all 3 segments in ensuring that we take pricing actions now to offset any material cost and other inflation that we see in our businesses. And so -- if we are successful doing that, and I'm very comfortable with that, then of course, we would expect an earnings conversion next year that would be in line what we do this year. The biggest driver, of course, will be what are the levels of organic growth. And that is not something we're ready to talk about at this point."

We targeted 30% attachment rate last year, which we achieved. And it was nice to see the attachment rate in 2Q for our chiller business up over 35% in 2Q. And I think it's a combination of what you said. We've added more feet on the street. We've added salespeople. We've added more structure and thought around our IC structure globally. And I think digital enablement is a big factor. You look at providing more prognostics and diagnostics and more digital differentiation is a big factor to create the kind of stickiness with our customers that really help differentiate us. So it's focus and it's those various things. 
And then in addition to attachment rate, we're very focused on overall coverage because attachment refers to you sell a chiller, it comes off the warranty period, are we signing a long-term agreement. And our expectation is that we do. So I'd like to get that to 50% as soon as possible, then ultimately, even higher because that's just how we run the business. Our other focus is overall coverage. We talked about going from 50,000 chillers that are covered by a long-term agreement to 60,000. 
We're on track to do that. And that goes beyond the initial sale that goes into units that are out in the field that we're converting them to long-term agreements covered by carrier. So very pleased with the aftermarket growth. We make more money in the aftermarket than we do in the upfront equipment sales. So it will be margin accretive as well."

And what we've done is put a dedicated focus on this effort through a sales force, through incentives, through a lot of structured intensity around making sure that we get our fair share of that. And look, there's 16,000 school districts in the United States. When we look through the year-to-date, our K-12 vertical is up 15% to 20%, and we think it's directly correlated to the additional funding that is in that space. 
And I think with this new infrastructure bill, of course, we'll see how that plays out once it goes over to the house, but we expect more money to be allocated to schools. But also when I see infrastructure bills, it actually plays very well for our strategic focus, healthy buildings, especially in school.

And so yes, Carrier 700 is a net number. But I would -- I'll be very clear to say this does not at all negatively influence our focus on it. We're more focused on it than before.

So I think we benefited from that spend. We're also gaining share there as well. We've seen nice share gains probably in a similar range to what we've seen on the residential side over the last 12 months. So the thing that's particularly encouraging about light commercial is that the field inventory levels are in check. They're low despite the strong sales, down only a few percent year-over-year, which means that there's not inventory in the channel.

They're real. They're acute. We came into the year thinking our sales will be up mid-single digits. Now it's going to be up double digits. So what that means from practical terms is that you're adding 2.5 million manufacturing hours, you have to go aggressively higher talent and demand. In places like Tennessee, we're competing for talent with Amazon and FedEx. So our operations team is dealing with challenges every day on the supply chain labor and really doing a phenomenal job to go to great lengths to support our customers. So I think we'll get out in front. We're doing a lot of things to make our supply chain more robust, with more automation, more dual sourcing. But it's not for the faint of heart.

It's going to be a subscription model. It will be margin accretive. But the real focus of Abound is making indoor air quality visible. So we started with a commercial office building customer outside of the D.C. area. We've had it running in a K-12 school outside of Atlanta.  We've gotten great feedback because as people come back to the office, as people go back into -- as people are going back into school in the spring, you can go into the school library and you have a dial that shows you that the air quality is good. And it gives you confidence as you go back into these indoor environment. So I don't want to oversell like how many we've sold. What it is, is early phases. We've been working with the Atlanta Braves in Truist Park. We have it running in our corporate headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. We've had a number of customers, very high-profile customers coming through and really trying to understand it, understand how it works not only for the tenants, but for the building operator. And I think it's going to be transformative. Early phases, as you said, from a differentiation perspective. It is open architecture. It interfaces with other control systems. So it's not a proprietary that will only work with our ALC controls business. And I think it's 1 of the key enablers to making the whole focus on healthy and sustainable buildings sticky over the long term."

Early in the year, it was several tens of millions of dollars. And so I'm not ready to call it this is it, we've seen the peak. But what I can tell you is that this is probably 1 of the most watched items within the company. 
We're doing, as we always do. At certain times, we block in positions for commodities for next year. And so that is happening per our practice. And as I mentioned, probably the most important thing is our ability to remain nimble and to flex our supply chain and to pass through pricing.

We're being aggressive in the factories, aggressive on supply chain.  Look, steel is very high. So we got to keep a close -- I mean, $600 a ton up to 2000 in the United States. So clearly, we would hope and expect that starts to modulate a bit.

Our customers are no different than us that they've been very public about some form of carbon neutrality, many of them, and we're helping them not only get to their commitments, but help quantify for them how they're getting to their commitments by an early replacement of a chiller and it also ties into healthy.

It is great to be hosting this call from the Carrier-cooled New York Stock Exchange, and we appreciate the support that we've received from the team here. Please turn to Slide 2.  
Before we discuss the second quarter results, let me address the press release that we issued Tuesday announcing that we signed an agreement to sell our Chubb business to APi Group for an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. To be clear, Carrier's Global Fire & Security products business is not part of this transaction and remains an integral part of Carrier's portfolio and our healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building strategy.  
We committed at our Investor Day last year to objectively assess our portfolio and do so through a rigorous application of our strategic and financial priorities. Within our Fire & Security portfolio, our products business is differentiated with leading market positions and attractive margins. Chubb is an industry leader with 13,000 employees that do a great job with installation and maintenance supporting our customers but it is an agnostic business that does not pull through our products and yields lower margins.  
We concluded that Chubb is more strategic to APi Group than it is to us. Divesting Chubb will significantly simplify our business. Chubb represents over 20% of our employees or less than 10% of our adjusted operating earnings. Selling Chubb will increase our focus on our core businesses and enable us to reinvest the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities to create long-term shareholder value. Patrick will discuss in more detail, but our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent: funding organic and inorganic growth, dividends and share buyback within a solid investment-grade credit rating.  
Our intention is to use the cash proceeds and excess cash on the balance sheet for acquisitions, buybacks and debt pay down over 12 to 18 months to help position the company for strategic growth and to generate attractive shareholder returns. The net result will be a new, more focused Carrier with more product differentiation, faster revenue growth, higher margins and higher returns on invested capital. This was an important deal for Carrier, and I want to thank our team and advisers for their tremendous work. Now turning to our Q2 results on Slide 3.  
Q2 was another strong quarter for us. Our growth continues to be fueled by broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and the benefit of our strategic investments. Managing the surge in growth has strained our extended supply chain, but our teams are navigating those challenges well to support our customers.  
You see our progress reflected in our 2Q results. Organic sales were up over 30%. Particularly encouraging was that the growth was strong across our portfolio and that we even grew 7% versus 2Q of 2019. Orders were up about 35% organically compared to last year, driving our backlog up 8% sequentially and up over 20% year-over-year, positioning us well for 3Q and the second half of the year.  
We produced $821 million of adjusted operating profit up over 70% year-over-year. And consistent with what we said during the April earnings call, Q2 incremental margins improved sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow continues to be strong with first half free cash flow up more than 30% over the first half of last year. Given our first half performance, strong backlog and expectations around the balance of the year, we are again raising our full year guidance for sales, earnings and cash.  
We now expect organic sales to grow 10% to 12%, adjusted EPS to increase by about 30% compared to last year, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow by $200 million to about $1.9 billion. Now turning to Slide 4. We remain confident in sustained growth in our end markets and that our new operating system, culture and team performance position us well to lead within our space. 
Key secular trends are likely to propel sustained growth for our industry. With people spending 90% of their time indoors and increasingly returning to their offices and recreational activities, we see more spend being allocated to the health, safety, comfort and intelligence of indoor environments of all types, from homes to schools to hospitals to commercial office buildings.  
Likewise, the need for safe cold chain solutions has been intensified by the focus on vaccine distribution and the increasing global middle classes demand for more fresh produce and other refrigerated products. And of course, the need for sustainable solutions. Given that the building sector contributes about 40% of carbon emissions and food waste contributes another 10% to 15%, we are confident that spend on sustainability will continue to drive demand for our green solutions.  
We, therefore, remain laser focused on healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, and we are leaning into those trends by executing on our 3-pronged growth strategy: Growing our core, expanding product extensions and increasing recurring revenues through digitally enabled aftermarket offerings. And we are seeing strong progress, as you can see on Slide 5.  
We have booked $250 million in healthy building orders year-to-date, and our active pipeline sits at $500 million. We are confident that spend on healthy buildings is not only sticky but that it will accelerate as building owners will play both defense and offense on behalf of their occupants. Defensive spend is largely focused on defending against the spread of airborne illnesses. For example, 40% of classrooms in the United States have insufficient ventilation and studies show that better ventilation and filtration materially reduced the spread of microscopic particulates like COVID and other illnesses like the flu and common colds. Building owners are also starting to invest in better ventilation to play offense.  
Recent studies have shown that people performed twice as well when the indoor environment is optimized. High CO2 levels, which can occur in crowded classrooms and offices with poor ventilation have been proven to impact brain-based skills while better ventilation and filtration significantly improved cognitive function. Because of the many benefits of healthy indoor air environments, our goal is to make indoor air visible. So good air quality becomes as important and expected as safe drinking water.  Abound is a key enabler to make that happen.  
We received favorable feedback from our key launch customers, which include a commercial office building and an elementary school, and we have deployed it in our company headquarters where we have been demonstrating its power to customers. We are now leveraging our global sales force to deploy Abound and have had significant interest from marquee customers. 
In addition to Abound, we recently launched a WiFi-enabled Carrier home air purifier with a HEPA-level filter as one of our latest healthy home offerings. We have now sold over 38,000 OptiClean units. On K-12, we have a dedicated team offering catered solutions to our customers, resulting in sales to about 15% to 20% more school districts so far this year compared to last year as part of what we expect to be a significant opportunity over the next few years. 
Similarly, our connected cold chain offerings are gaining traction. Our cloud-based digital Lynx offering that we are building in partnership with AWS was recognized by Fast Company as one of 2021's world-changing ideas. In the container space, we are adding connectivity for thousands of units each month and now can support mixed fleets Carrier and Non-Carrier, thereby increasing our recurring revenues and reducing our customer maintenance and logistic costs.  
We had significant Lynx wins this quarter with truck/trailer, including 1,700 more trailer refrigeration units for Prime and a 3-year supply agreement with U.K. grocer Sainsbury's for all of its truck and trailer transport refrigeration equipment. CORTIX is Carrier's AI and IoT platform that offers predictive insights, recommendations and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations while minimizing our customers' energy consumption. Currently, over 220,000 pieces of equipment are connected to CORTIX. Digital solutions are helping to drive increased aftermarket and recurring revenues.  
Aftermarket sales for Carrier were up about 20% in Q2 over last year, all helped by our differentiated BlueEdge tiered offerings. Our attachment rate in commercial HVAC was more than 35% in Q2, and we are on track to add another 10,000 chillers to long-term contracts this year from about 50,000 to 60,000. Likewise, in our Refrigeration business, our Europe truck trailer business sold nearly 6,000 BlueEdge service agreements in the first half of the year.  
In addition, our Fire & Security segment continues to expand our key digital offerings. Earlier this year, LenelS2 was featured in the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, and we're excited to work with Apple on providing BlueDiamond mobile credentials in Apple Wallet, on iPhone and Apple Watch. As employees come back to office buildings, this work can increase the profile of access control solutions that help reduce touch points, enhance occupant experience and increased confidence in indoor environments. So very significant progress on healthy, safe and intelligent offerings and recurring revenues. And on Slide 6, you see similar progress on our focus on sustainability. In short,  we are committed to providing environmentally sustainable solutions and our performance over the past year reflects just that.  
We are on track to meet our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton and ensuring our operations are carbon neutral by 2030. Electrification and energy efficiency are major focus areas for us. Commercial heat pumps in Europe and residential heat pumps in North America were both up 20% to 30% in the quarter. Electrification is equally critical to our Refrigeration business. Interest in our Vector eCool unit in Europe remains high and our backlog continues to grow. This is the only 100% electric trailer reefer unit in the market today.  
Our efforts in helping customers reduce emissions and creating more energy-efficient solutions are starting to be reflected in some of our external ratings, including improvements in both our MSCI and Sustainalytics scores in the past year. 
As you can see on the slide, we are now considered a leader in the industry. So great progress on ESG, which is a fundamental aspect of who we are. So before I turn it over to Patrick, a word on a leadership change that we recently announced. In a couple of weeks, Tim White will join us as President of our Refrigeration segment.  
Tim has been running GE's multibillion-dollar onshore wind business for the Americas region, and he ran key P&Ls within Collins Aerospace that included electric systems, environmental control systems and engine control systems. He is the perfect leader to take this well-positioned business to the next level as we focus on electrification, digitalization and sustainable solutions. 
I also want to thank David Appel for his tremendous leadership of the segment. We are fortunate to have David moving to Paris where our commercial refrigeration business is headquartered to provide the focus that, that business needs to improve operational, strategic and financial performance. We appreciate David taking on this critical assignment. So with that, let me turn it over to Patrick."

I'll start with comments about the quarter and the outlook and then provide additional color on the Chubb transaction. Please turn to Slide 7. As Dave mentioned, Q2 was a good quarter with sales, operating earnings, adjusted EPS and free cash flow all exceeding our expectations.  
Sales of $5.4 billion were up 37% compared to last year. Currency was a 5-point tailwind for sales in the quarter or about $200 million and acquisitions, that's mainly Chigo, added another point of growth. Given the impact from COVID last year, this quarter obviously had an easy comparison. Nonetheless, organic sales growth of 31% was significantly better than we expected across all our businesses.  
Adjusted operating margin expanded over 300 basis points to 15.1%. Strong sales growth and benefits from Carrier 700 were partially offset by investments and higher input costs. As we expected, price/cost was negative in the quarter given the timing of price and cost increases, Much stronger-than-expected demand, combined with supply chain challenges negatively impacted factory efficiency. It also meant material purchases went beyond block positions. And as a result, we bought some materials and components at spot prices and utilized expedited freight. I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we already announced additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain.  
Reported earnings conversion of about 24% improved sequentially, and excluding currency and acquisitions, conversion was in the high 20s. Free cash flow of $482 million in the quarter reflected better-than-expected net income and was similar to last year's second quarter despite $180 million of higher interest and tax payments. Finally, we repurchased about 2 million shares at an average price of $44.33 during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about 3 million shares.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up 32% in the quarter with nearly 35% residential HVAC growth. As we previously said, we expect that residential field inventory levels to finish approximately 10% to 15% higher than the end of Q2 2019. Strong distributor movement of over 20% compared to last year led to field inventories ending the quarter only 7% higher than at the end of Q2 of 2019, a much more balanced inventory level. North American light commercial business saw a significant rebound with sales up over 60% in the quarter. Light commercial field inventory levels are now down just 3% year-over-year.  
Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 20% organically. HVAC team expanded margins by 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses in this segment, including services. The segment remains on track to generate about 60% adjusted operating margin this year.  
Moving to refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 38% organically as the cyclical recovery in transport that we see in orders continue to convert into sales. Transport refrigeration was up over 40% in the quarter with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. Commercial refrigeration grew about 30% as reopenings in Europe drove strong growth. 
Margins for this segment were up 320 basis points in the quarter compared to last year, mainly as a result of the higher sales. We continue to meet customer demand but are incurring higher costs to do so, including air freight. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half as the higher-margin North America truck and trailer business recovery continues. Given the higher input costs, we now expect full year 2021 operating margin for this segment to be in the mid-13% range, a little lower than we previously expected.  
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales at the Fire & Security segment grew 25%, and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. Within the Products business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid. Given the easier comparisons, Access Solutions returned to double-digit growth our industrial businesses were up high single digits. 
In industrial fire, we saw the recovery for upgrades and retrofits begin in marine services and in the oil and gas markets. Higher sales and Carrier 700 performance helped drive a 140 basis point margin expansion in this segment. With the higher sales outlook and the timing of price and cost actions, we expect higher margins in the back of the year compared to the first half of the year and overall margins to be in the mid-13s for the year.  
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the second quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and points to a better second half than we previously expected. Commercial HVAC orders were up over 30% compared to last year, and backlog increased almost 20% year-over-year and up mid- to high single digits sequentially from last quarter.  
For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. Strong order intake and backlog exiting Q2 should position this segment to achieve the expected high teens organic sales growth for the full year. Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. The product orders were up a bit over 25% year-over-year, especially in residential and commercial fire. Field orders were up 25% to 30%, organic.  
I'll skip Slide 12. So let's move to Slide 13, our updated outlook. To be clear, we will include Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on stronger-than-expected Q2 performance and higher backlogs, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 5% to 8% to a new range of 10% to 12%. A bit more than half a point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs versus our April guidance. Last quarter, we said material and component input costs were about $120 million or so higher than 2020. We now expect those input costs to be up an additional $125 million.  
We intend to offset this through additional pricing actions. We recently announced the third price increase in our residential HVAC business for September as well as a third price increase in transport refrigeration, and we are implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio. 
Our new outlook includes $125 million of additional pricing compared to our April guidance. For the full year, we expect price cost to be neutral though we expect it to be a modest headwind in Q3, offsetting higher input costs with incremental pricing on a dollar-for-dollar basis protects profitability, but of course, hurts reported margin and conversion. 
Despite these cost inefficiencies, we now expect to deliver an adjusted operating margin of over 13.5% for the year, better than our previous outlook. Another way to think about the outlook is that the revenues are now expected to be about $1 billion higher than the April guide. Of that, about $125 million is priced to offset increased input costs and about $200 million is acquisition-related sales with little profit contribution this year. 
The conversion on the remaining $650 million to $700 million of sales approaches the 30% we would normally expect. This all leads to an adjusted EPS outlook range of $2.10 to $2.20, a $0.15 improvement at the midpoint from our prior guidance.  We also now expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance. 
Slide 14 shows a bridge for the $0.15 improvement in our adjusted EPS outlook from the midpoint of our prior guide to the midpoint of our current guidance. The biggest driver is the operational conversion on additional sales. Moving over to Slide 15. I'll provide more details regarding Chubb's transaction.  
You can see a brief profile of Chubb on the left side of the slide. We expect revenues for Chubb to be about $2.2 billion this year with high single-digit operating margins. Excluding Chubb, Carrier's operating margins would be about 50 to 100 basis points higher, free cash flow conversion about 100%, and we would also expect to have a higher growth and modestly higher return on invested capital profile. The remaining Fire & Security segment will include a portfolio of differentiated, high-margin businesses with leading positions in their respective markets. Sales would be about $3.5 billion and operating margin in the high teens.
With respect to transaction details, the enterprise value is $3.1 billion, and net after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $2.6 billion. As part of the transaction, about 2/3 of Carrier's total pension and post retirement assets and liabilities will be transferred to APi. That is over $2 billion and significantly simplifies and derisks our balance sheet. Related to the pension, we expect most to all of our noncash, nonservice pension benefit on the income statement to go away. While this generates about $70 million in annual earnings, we do not believe it represents any economic value. As customary, the sale is subject to a consultation process and regulatory approvals. Expected close is late Q4 2021 or early Q1 2022.  
As to the use of proceeds, we intend to use the approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds as well as available excess cash for a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. We expect to delever by about $750 million post transaction to maintain our leverage profile commensurate with the EBITDA reduction. We have a growing pipeline of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, and our Board just approved an incremental $1.75 billion share repurchase authorization.  
We will be flexible between share repurchases and acquisitions, and now expect 2021 repurchases to exceed the 5 million shares we previously discussed. In closing, we had a good first half with strong double-digit organic growth. Congratulations to our team in supporting stronger-than-expected demand in a very challenging supply chain environment. 
With our performance so far, along with a solid order activity and backlog growth, we feel confident meaningfully raising our full year guidance. And the Chubb transaction simplifies our portfolio, enhances management focus, creates a more attractive company profile and generates cash to reinvest in higher share owner value-creating opportunities. With that, I'll turn it back to you, David."

Frankly, we -- given the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet, we may not need those Chubb proceeds.

So it was -- it's an important piece of our channel, but it was agnostic just as other parts of the channel would be to us. So when you look at our Fire & Security segment, call it, $5.5 billion, you got a couple of billion with Chubb that was in the single digit -- high single-digit range for ROS. And then the remaining $3.5 billion of products you have highly differentiated products, #1 or #2 in all of our segments. It fits well with the whole healthy building trend and the other parts of the HVAC portfolio and the ROS is close to 20%. 
So very, very strategic, something that we really want to lean into. And I think that Martin Franklin and the team over at the APi Group will really take what's a great business with Chubb to new levels. We had a choice should we kind of make the investments to take the margins higher of Chubb or let someone else do it and redeploy that capital for parts of our portfolio that are more core and more differentiated, and we elected to do the latter."

In terms of free cash flow conversion on Chubb, actually, Chubb was one of the reasons why our key cash flow conversion for the overall company was less than 100%. And part of that, of course, gets back to the noncash, nonservice pension benefit we saw in the income statement. That's about $70 million on an annual basis. we don't attribute any economic value to that. That headwind called on free cash flow conversion will go away. 
I would also add that from an overall company perspective, whether it's from a working capital perspective or an ROIC perspective, Chubb was below the company average. And so without Chubb, all of these metrics, we expect them to improve, including, of course, our operating margin."

So we thought that our inventory levels at the end of 2Q were going to be up 10% to 15% versus the same time at the end of 2019, which is an indicator we have been watching closely. And inventory level in the field for us ended up only up 7% versus the same time in Q2 of 2019.  
And you look at a collection of factors that are driving the strength that we're seeing. Housing starts, it's going to be up 13% or so this year. We are seeing people obviously buying and selling more homes. And one of the things that happens when you buy a home is sometimes you replace the air conditioning system. So I think that's a driver.
There's been a lot of talk about work from home, of course, but I think it's -- without being too quantitative about it, it just seems that units are running hotter and longer getting more cycles on them, and that has to be contributing to some of the strength that we're seeing. And we benefited from share gains. I mean we're up -- if you look at the last 12 months, you really can't measure share 1 quarter at a time, but you can look at -- over the last 12 months, our share is up over 200 basis points.  
And it's a combination of converting dealers, but also I do believe that our operational performance, even though we have been far from flawless has helped us, albeit, frankly, at a higher cost, but we've gone out of our way to support our customers. So I think, Steve, you put that all together and as we start looking ahead, we want to -- we expect that when we come out of this year, our inventory levels should be in balance. We're going to carefully watch movement. We have announced our third price increase effective September 1 this year, which was really focused on 2022 as we announced that. 
And housing starts, we'll have to see how that plays out. The estimates are all over the map, but maybe around that to flattish for right now, but we'll see how that plays out. And then we'll start to see some perhaps early buy because of the 2023 change. So you put that all together, I think we're trying to stay very close to our distributors, keep inventory levels in check and continue to support our customers."

And then the Chigo acquisition, the first year with a lot of revenue and given some of the onetime costs, not a lot of earnings contribution yet. 
And so that's really the walk between the low 20s and the high 20s from an earnings conversion point of view. And then, of course, what I'm not taking into account here is that as we raise price just to offset some input costs, that's somewhat of a headwind as well.  
For next year, we're really not at a point where we can talk a lot about next year. What I can say is that, and I mentioned this before, we have a really strong focus within all 3 segments in ensuring that we take pricing actions now to offset any material cost and other inflation that we see in our businesses. 
And so -- if we are successful doing that, and I'm very comfortable with that, then of course, we would expect an earnings conversion next year that would be in line what we do this year. The biggest driver, of course, will be what are the levels of organic growth. And that is not something we're ready to talk about at this point."

We targeted 30% attachment rate last year, which we achieved. And it was nice to see the attachment rate in 2Q for our chiller business up over 35% in 2Q. And I think it's a combination of what you said. We've added more feet on the street.
We've added salespeople. We've added more structure and thought around our IC structure globally. And I think digital enablement is a big factor. You look at providing more prognostics and diagnostics and more digital differentiation is a big factor to create the kind of stickiness with our customers that really help differentiate us. So it's focus and it's those various things.  
And then in addition to attachment rate, we're very focused on overall coverage because attachment refers to you sell a chiller, it comes off the warranty period, are we signing a long-term agreement. And our expectation is that we do. 
So I'd like to get that to 50% as soon as possible, then ultimately, even higher because that's just how we run the business. Our other focus is overall coverage. We talked about going from 50,000 chillers that are covered by a long-term agreement to 60,000.  
We're on track to do that. And that goes beyond the initial sale that goes into units that are out in the field that we're converting them to long-term agreements covered by Carrier. So very pleased with the aftermarket growth. We make more money in the aftermarket than we do in the upfront equipment sales. So it will be margin accretive as well."

And what we've done is put a dedicated focus on this effort through a sales force, through incentives, through a lot of structured intensity around making sure that we get our fair share of that. And look, there's 16,000 school districts in the United States. When we look through the year-to-date, our K-12 vertical is up 15% to 20%, and we think it's directly correlated to the additional funding that is in that space. 
And I think with this new infrastructure bill, of course, we'll see how that plays out once it goes over to the House, but we expect more money to be allocated to schools. But also when I see infrastructure bills, it actually plays very well for our strategic focus, healthy buildings, especially in school. 
Sustainability, there's going to be funding in there for things like sustainability for airports, that's exactly in our wheelhouse and then intelligence and our ability to use our Abound system for both healthy and sustainable solutions in things like the schools and in airports, in infrastructure, I think, will be a really good opportunity.

About half of our spend on K-12 is light commercial, the other half applied. So I think we benefited from that spend. We're also gaining share there as well. We've seen nice share gains probably in a similar range to what we've seen on the residential side over the last 12 months. 
So the thing that's particularly encouraging about light commercial is that the field inventory levels are in check. They're low despite the strong sales, down only a few percent year-over-year, which means that there's not inventory in the channel.

And it was 57 in June. It's the fifth straight month that is higher than 50. And I think it's a combination of probably catch up the things that were put on hold and new construction that is now being built in anticipation of the economic momentum we're seeing more globally. 
We've had some key wins recently and not only things like data centers and warehouses, which generally were strong throughout the pandemic, but commercial office buildings, we've had some nice wins there, both in our HVAC business, but also in our controls business. And of course, in Fire & Security. 
So education, health care, commercial buildings, there's a lot of indication that it's pretty broad-based. And one thing that we found particularly encouraging was it wasn't a U.S. phenomenon. Europe, was quite strong. Your orders in Europe were up over 50% in the quarter, and part of that easy comparable part of it is you're seeing some real pent-up demand there. And then, of course, it's not only applied, but our focus on aftermarket, which was up 15% in just HVAC alone in the quarter. So some encouraging signs."

They're real. They're acute. We came into the year thinking our sales will be up mid-single digits. Now it's going to be up double digits. So what that means from practical terms is that you're adding 2.5 million manufacturing hours, you have to go aggressively hire talent and demand. 
In places like Tennessee, we're competing for talent with Amazon and FedEx. So our operations team is dealing with challenges every day on the supply chain labor and really doing a phenomenal job to go to great lengths to support our customers.

So we started with a commercial office building customer outside of the D.C. area. 
We've had it running in a K-12 school outside of Atlanta.  We've gotten great feedback because as people come back to the office, as people go back into -- as people are going back into school in the spring, you can go into the school library and you have a dial that shows you that the air quality is good. And it gives you confidence as you go back into these indoor environment. 
So I don't want to oversell like how many we've sold. What it is, is early phases. We've been working with the Atlanta Braves in Truist Park. We have it running in our corporate headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. 
We've had a number of customers, very high-profile customers coming through and really trying to understand it, understand how it works not only for the tenants, but for the building operator. And I think it's going to be transformative. 
Early phases, as you said, from a differentiation perspective. It is open architecture. It interfaces with other control systems. So it's not a proprietary that will only work with our ALC controls business.

And I think the key takeaway that we have as a management team is our need to be able to be flexible and adjust quickly, whether it's from a supply chain management point of view or what is from an ability of passing through prices to our customers to ensure that we remain price/cost neutral. 
And so of course, we've seen a tremendous increase in input cost. I mentioned that for the year now, we're sitting at about $250 million of input costs. Early in the year, it was several tens of millions of dollars. And so I'm not ready to call it this is it, we've seen the peak. But what I can tell you is that this is probably one of the most watched items within the company. 
We're doing, as we always do. At certain times, we block in positions for commodities for next year. And so that is happening per our practice. And as I mentioned, probably the most important thing is our ability to remain nimble and to flex our supply chain and to pass through pricing.

We're being aggressive in the factories, aggressive on supply chain.  Look, steel is very high. So we got to keep a close eye, I mean, $600 a ton up to 2000 in the United States. So clearly, we would hope and expect that starts to modulate a bit.

And you can make a business case just on sustainability alone. If you look at the savings you can get and there are some government incentives. But as you move to more sustainable chillers then you can get very significant savings and also help customers hit their own ESG targets.
Our customers are no different than us that they've been very public about some form of carbon neutrality, many of them, and we're helping them not only get to their commitments, but help quantify for them how they're getting to their commitments by an early replacement of a chiller and it also ties into healthy.

I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and our strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives. 
Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued inflationary headwinds and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers, and I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues. 
You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax rate. Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs, while preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth. 
Our HVAC team more effectively manage price cost, and that was reflected in its segment margins of 19.1%. Our Fire & Security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by chip shortages. 
The Refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continue to gain traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and cost resulting in disappointing segment margins. I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to position us well for 2022. 
All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from 10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed, up 6% over 2019. We are also raising adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20, up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full year input cost pressure has now increased from about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically and strategically. 
Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on site at our suppliers. We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital tool. 
Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual-sourcing of critical components. We will end 2021 with over 35%, we are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our acute focus and we are working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing certain commodities to remain low cost and reduce logistics costs and complexity. 
We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year. We will have more than 3 million automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier excellence to drive productivity. 
For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A. 
We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth, and you see our progress on Slide 4. Our north star remains consistent, to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. In healthy buildings, we have over $350 million in orders and a pipeline of over $550 million, ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2. 
We are very well positioned to address our customers' sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential heating sales in North America are now heat pumps. We were honored to win a prestigious innovation award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with grid's intelligence, the industry's most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are now heat pumps, up from 15% 5 years ago, and we project this to be 50% within 5 years. 
We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. Its global warming potential is 70% lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers' energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy technologies. Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3 contributing to share gains. 
On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited with Dr. Scott Boden from Emery at his newly open state-of-the-art health care facility. Carrier and Emery are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent and sustainable facility with the full suite of carrier technologies: HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management digital solutions and Abound, which ties it all together. 
Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck/trailer and shipping fleet customers are increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date, and we have a strong order book and pipeline. We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States to provide subscription-based telematics and reefer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from increased efficiencies, less downtime and lost products and overall lower energy consumption and costs. 
We continue to see progress on our 3 pillars of growth, with share gains, VRF, expanded geographic coverage and increased digitally-enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I'll discuss more on Slide 5. 
Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year, and we are tracking to double-digit aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including spare parts, preventative maintenance, break-fix repairs, mid-life modifications and upgrades, remote monitoring and other digital services. 
Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to Abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin parts sales with our national account customers in residential and light commercial HVAC. 
Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have 60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In Refrigeration, we signed a 3-year BlueEdge service contract with Scott's RL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet. Tangible progress on these strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top line sticky growth in 2022 and beyond. 
Another component of our growth is acquisitions. As you can see on Slide 6, we are making great progress in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including M&A, both focusing on digitally-enabled recurring revenues. For example, Nlyte is complementary to our ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical. 
Nlyte software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading technology, which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated heat. Together, we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling systems to optimize data center operations. 
Similarly, Broker Bay is complementary to our super business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high market share in locks that support residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication and actionable insights. 
Broker Bay brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds these sought-after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer response has been tremendous. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm company. Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood and carbon monoxide alarms, including the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our innovative residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation pipeline globally. The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline, and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities. 
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"

Please turn to Slide 7. 
As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that was offset by higher-than-expected input costs. All segments were on track to over-deliver on top line growth, but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and led to shipment delays and contributed to record backlogs. 
Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was a 1 point tailwind for sales in the quarter and acquisitions, mainly added another 2 points of growth. Given the unusually strong residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison. Nonetheless, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%. 
Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year, but was up about 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price/cost was modestly negative in the quarter. 
I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America. Fire & Security and Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases. 
Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages. Last year, Q3 benefited from timing around payables, which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $146 million, and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year. 
In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge summarizing many of the points I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings. In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganizations to enable the pending Chubb sale triggering tax liabilities. 
On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or January. 
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about 2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC given the tough compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year. The result is that residential field inventories were down high single digits sequentially from the end of Q2. 
The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically. 
As expected, HVAC margins were down about 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions and the impact of additional pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bps from the second quarter and the segment remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year. 
Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. 
Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China. Margins were up about 40 bps in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases as well as last year benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this segment. As Dave mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment, and we now expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew about 2% as products were up about 3%, while field was flat. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, Residential fire was down slightly, while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire were both up high single digits. 
Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year as last year benefited from the temporary cost actions. Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall margins for this segment to be in the mid-30s for the year. 
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial orders remains positive despite the very strong third quarter last year. Within that business, orders were down in Residential in the high single digits on tough comparisons but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog in Residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point last year. 
Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5% sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck/trailer business remained solid and up about 15% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Europe. The order intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected high-teens organic sales growth for the year. 
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-over-year, with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire. Field orders were up mid- to high single digits organically. 
On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies, except in China. In China, HVAC orders were up in the mid-single digits while orders in Refrigeration and Fire & Security were down in the double digits. 
Let's move to Slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said last quarter, we are including Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year which is higher than our prior 10% to 12% outlook. 
The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021 with price cost being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price cost in Q4. 
We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full year incremental investments are expected to be about $150 million, consistent with prior guidance. The Q3 discrete tax benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an updated 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the noncash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion. 
Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance. As you can see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate as higher volume is offset by price cost. Just to note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter. 
In closing, the first 9 months of the year was strong, with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 14."

And let me start and Patrick can add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some onetime cost takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some onetime benefits we were doing seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which is what we're seeing is sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades. 
So what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we are price/cost-positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can and also being controlling the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance. We're driving productivity. We're managing commodities as best we can. 
So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique environment, we stay price/cost-positive. So we still mention where the Carrier 700 number is to make sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will form a bit of a reset. And then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are. 
The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focused every day on making sure that we control everything we can control on the cost side is still there, and it will never stop. What we'll do in our February 22 Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it going forward. But the underlying DNA of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier."

Some of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong. 
We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse, K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back online, and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers. 
So when you look at all the different variables, orders up more than 40% year-over-year when we look at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020 and movement from our distributors into our end customer base remains in the double-digit range.

We want to be in China for China, and it's a very strategic market for us over the long term. 
If you look at the ever grand situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities focused on multifamily residential, which is for us, is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales. It's probably 0.5% of our sales, that specific area. So I think we're well -- and well calibrated on some of those issues. Overall, when you look at China, real estate is a very important part of China. So I do think the government is going to be incentivized to support that industry, the overall real estate industry.

So look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We look at October, orders continued to be strong. And all the underlying fundamentals with new housing starts this year is in the plus 13% range year-over-year. I think for the homebuilders, there's going to be some push out into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us are seeing.

So you noticed a very strong sales growth, double-digit growth in transport. CCR, commercial refrigeration was about flat. But as we mentioned, the margin performance of this is disappointing, given the strong sales growth. And so a focus in that segment now is a closer -- a better control on the cost side, but also, and I would say especially being more aggressive and timely on price increases. 
You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has given a somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing, but that is changing now. And so as that window opens up and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that, one, the prices for these orders are higher; and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices change. And so it's a significant focus for Tim White and the team."

With commercial HVAC, look, there's a lot of encouraging signs there as well. ABI, it's been higher than the Architectural Billing Index. It's been higher than 50 now for 8 consecutive months. Patrick mentioned that overall, we were up mid-single digits. North America was kind of in line with that. Europe was a bit higher. China was a bit higher. Orders were up over 10% for commercial HVAC. 
And a really important thing for us is we really like our ALC controls business. That was up very strong. Those sales were up in the high teens, high margin, very differentiated, important business. And aftermarket has been very thematic for us, and we grew double digits there. So we're encouraged by commercial HVAC. Overall, when you look at just equipment applied orders, those were up 15%.

But for planning purposes, we're actually including additional price increases to address the continued input cost headwinds and the hedges that are rolling off from which we benefited last year. As Dave mentioned, just in HVAC this week, we've announced price increases of up to 12% in residential and light commercial. I think it is safe to say that we're assuming input cost headwinds next year that exceeded the $375 million we're seeing this year. 
And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are about $375 million input cost. So we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing actions that we have taken this year, the carryover is about $350 million to $400 million. That excludes the additional price increases that we've announced this week in -- for resi and light commercial and excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our businesses. 
And so from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price cost neutral. Of course, we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing."

I would say very -- completely consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Our first priority, fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, then funding a growing and sustainable dividend and then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase. What we mentioned last quarter with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt. That's kind of prorated from a capital structure point of view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb. 
What we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion. We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And what that would leave us at the end of this year, it will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year. And what we've said from a repurchase point of view, is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months toward share repurchase. 
So that kind of gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I mentioned, priority #1 is funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant capital that we can put to work, and that's why we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made some acquisitions this year. We covered them in some of the slides. But there are some acquisitions that are a little bit larger in size in the pipeline as well. And so we're working hard on getting some of these on board.

Of course, it has a negative impact on our conversion number. 
That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we don't want to get into that good or bad.

And then continue to really lean into recurring revenues, aftermarket digital. We're in the first inning on that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will be very thematic for us certainly going into next year and for years to come. 
We said that we would be super aggressive on cost.

We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions, simplification across the portfolio, that will continue to be. 
And we have -- we've gone from $10 billion of net debt when we spun to now. We'll end, after we sell Chubb, to closer to $4 billion of net debt.

The -- we have really tried to be as specific as we can on what's the pricing cost we're seeing by quarter, and we'll give it in that color next year. Carrier 700, when you see the kind of input costs we're seeing, it did change when it costs 10x as much to get a container out of China into the United States. When we're buying chips on the spot market, there have been some clear inflationary pressures that have affected the overall Carrier 700. 
Having said that, if you were to step foot in this building, you would see an entire war room focus on commodity management with our suppliers. You would see productivity being rolled out across the world. So we will give specificity on cost carryover, inflationary pressures going into next year and how we're going to offset that at a minimum with price that, again, like Patrick said, being price/cost positive is our clear intent. But the Carrier 700 number itself is lower this year than what we thought. Patrick, do you want to add to that?"

I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability",1571,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.  
I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and our strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives.  
Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued inflationary headwinds and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers, and I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues.  
You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax rate. Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs, while preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth.  
Our HVAC team more effectively manage price/cost, and that was reflected in its segment margins of 19.1%. Our Fire & Security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by chip shortages.  
The Refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continue to gain traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and cost, resulting in disappointing segment margins. I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to position us well for 2022.  
All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from 10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed, up 6% over 2019. We are also raising adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20, up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow.  
Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full year input cost pressure has now increased from about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically and strategically.  
Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on site at our suppliers. We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital tool.  
Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual sourcing of critical components. We will end 2021 with over 35%. We are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our acute focus, and we are working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing certain commodities to remain low cost and reduce logistics costs and complexity.  
We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year. We will have more than 3 million automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier Excellence to drive productivity.  
For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A.  
We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth, and you see our progress on Slide 4. Our north star remains consistent, to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. In healthy buildings, we have over $350 million in orders and a pipeline of over $550 million, ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2.  
We are very well positioned to address our customers' sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential heating sales in North America are now heat pumps. We were honored to win a prestigious innovation award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with Greenspeed Intelligence, the industry's most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are now heat pumps, up from 15% 5 years ago, and we project this to be 50% within 5 years.  
We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. Its global warming potential is 70% lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers' energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy technologies. Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3 contributing to share gains.  
On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited with Dr. Scott Boden from Emory at his newly opened state-of-the-art health care facility. Carrier and Emory are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent and sustainable facility with the full suite of Carrier technologies: HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management, digital solutions and Abound, which ties it all together.  
Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck/trailer and shipping fleet customers are increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date, and we have a strong order book and pipeline. We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States to provide subscription-based telematics and reefer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from increased efficiencies, less downtime and lost products and overall lower energy consumption and costs.  
We continue to see progress on our 3 pillars of growth, with share gains, VRF, expanded geographic coverage and increased digitally-enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I'll discuss more on Slide 5.  
Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year, and we are tracking to double-digit aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including spare parts, preventative maintenance, break-fix repairs, mid-life modifications and upgrades, remote monitoring and other digital services.  
Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to Abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin parts sales with our national account customers in residential and light commercial HVAC.  
Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have 60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In Refrigeration, we signed a 3-year BlueEdge Service contract with ScottsRL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet. Tangible progress on these strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top line sticky growth in 2022 and beyond.  
Another component of our growth is acquisitions. As you can see on Slide 6, we are making great progress in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including M&A, both focusing on digitally-enabled recurring revenues. For example, Nlyte is complementary to our ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical.  
Nlyte Software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading technology, which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated heat. Together, we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling systems to optimize data center operations.  
Similarly, BrokerBay is complementary to our Supra business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high market share in locks that support residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication and actionable insights.  
BrokerBay brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds these sought-after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer response has been tremendous.  
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm company. Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood and carbon monoxide alarms, including the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our innovative residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation pipeline globally. The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline, and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities.  
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"
620281,1684665996,2415878,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7.  As expected, the results were very similar to Q2.

Please turn to Slide 7.  
As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that was offset by higher-than-expected input costs. All segments were on track to over-deliver on top line growth, but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and led to shipment delays and contributed to record backlogs.  
Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was 1 point tailwind for sales in the quarter and acquisitions, mainly Giwee,added another 2 points of growth. Given the unusually strong residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison. Nonetheless, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%.  
Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year, but was up about 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price/cost was modestly negative in the quarter.  
I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America. Fire & Security and Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases.  
Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages. Last year, Q3 benefited from timing around payables which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $146 million, and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year.  
In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge summarizing many of the points I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings. In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganizations to enable the pending Chubb sale triggering tax liabilities.  
On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or January.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about 2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC given the tough compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year. The result is that residential field inventories were down high single digits sequentially from the end of Q2.  
The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically.  
As expected, HVAC margins were down about 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions and the impact of additional pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bps from the second quarter and the segment remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year.  
Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter.  
Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China. Margins were up about 40 bps in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases as well as last year benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this segment. As Dave mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment, and we now expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected.  
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew about 2% as products were up about 3%, while field was flat. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential fire was down slightly, while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire were both up high single digits.  
Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year as last year benefited from the temporary cost actions. Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall margins for this segment to be in the [ mid-13 ] for the year.  
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial orders remained positive despite the very strong third quarter last year. Within that business, orders were down in residential in the high single digits on tough comparisons but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point last year.  
Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5% sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck/trailer business remained solid and up about 15% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Europe. The order intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected high-teens organic sales growth for the year.  
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-over-year, with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire. Field orders were up mid- to high single digits organically.  
On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies, except in China. In China, HVAC orders were up in the mid-single digits while orders in Refrigeration and Fire & Security were down in the double digits.  
Let's move to Slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said last quarter, we are including Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year, which is higher than our prior 10% to 12% outlook.  
The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021 with price/cost being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price/cost in Q4.  
We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full year incremental investments are expected to be about $150 million, consistent with prior guidance. The Q3 discrete tax benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an updated 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the noncash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion.  
Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance. As you can see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate as higher volume is offset by price/cost. Just to note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter.  
In closing, the first 9 months of the year was strong, with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 14."

And let me start and Patrick can add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some onetime cost takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some onetime benefits we were doing seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which is what we're seeing is sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades. 
So what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we are price/cost-positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can and also being controlling the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance. We're driving productivity. We're managing commodities as best we can. 
So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique environment, we stay price/cost-positive. So we still mention where the Carrier 700 number is to make sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will form a bit of a reset. And then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are. 
The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focused every day on making sure that we control everything we can control on the cost side is still there, and it will never stop. What we'll do in our February 22 Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it going forward. But the underlying DNA of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier."

What we had said when we were forecasting like commercial coming into this year, as we reminded people that it's 80% replacement, 20% new. So there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of last year. Some of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong. 
We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse. K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back online, and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers. 
So when you look at all the different variables, orders up more than 40% year-over-year when we look at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020, and movement from our distributors into our end customer base remains in the double-digit range. And we -- then we just announced a price increase of up to 12%. So a lot to like in light commercial."

We want to be in China for China, and it's a very strategic market for us over the long term. 
If you look at the Evergrande situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities focused on multifamily residential, which is, for us, is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales. It's probably 0.5% of our sales, that specific area. So I think we're well -- and well calibrated on some of those issues.

So the good news is that movement continues to be positive. Field inventories, Patrick mentioned, sequentially was actually down 7% versus Q2. And even splits are down versus prior year. And our backlog, as I mentioned to Andrew, is up significantly over last quarter and even more significantly over previous year. 
So look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We look at October, orders continued to be strong. And all the underlying fundamentals with new housing starts this year is in the plus 13% range year-over-year. I think for the homebuilders, there's going to be some pushout into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us are seeing.

You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has given a somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing, but that is changing now. And so as that window opens up and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that, one, the prices for these orders are higher; and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices change.

And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are about $375 million input cost. So we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing actions that we have taken this year, the carryover is about $350 million to $400 million. That excludes the additional price increases that we've announced this week in -- for resi and light commercial and excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our businesses. 
And so from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price/cost neutral. Of course, we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing."

Just kind of wondering how we square up the order commentary with the sales growth this quarter."

And just as we were coming out of those kind of 3PL-related type issues, we then ran into a bunch of supply chain issues. 
So our sales could have clearly been higher in the quarter if we didn't have that. We're working closely with our customers to make sure that they know what they're going to get when. But order is strong. It's in one of the factories that we would expect to start to recover as the supply chain issues from their Tier 1 start to recover."

I would say very -- completely consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Our first priority, fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, then funding a growing and sustainable dividend and then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase. What we mentioned last quarter with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt. That's kind of prorated from a capital structure point of view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb. 
What we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion. We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And what that would leave us at the end of this year, it will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year. And what we've said from a repurchase point of view is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months toward share repurchase. 
So that kind of gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I mentioned, priority #1 is funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant capital that we can put to work, and that's why we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made some acquisitions this year. We covered them in some of the slides. But there are some acquisitions that are a little bit larger in size in the pipeline as well. And so we're working hard on getting some of these onboard.

And then, of course, an important element this year is, of course, the whole price/cost dynamic, where we're adding this year pricing of well over $300 million for the full year, yet that is not falling through the bottom line. Of course, it has a negative impact on our conversion number. 
That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we don't want to get into that, good or bad. But from an operational point of view, we absolutely would still target earnings conversion in that high 20s to about 30% range. Depending on what do we do on the acquisition side, depending on price/cost, that might be slightly different. But operationally, that's absolutely something that we target and work towards.

And then continue to really lean into recurring revenues, aftermarket digital. We're in the first inning on that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will be very thematic for us certainly going into next year and for years to come. 
We said that we would be super aggressive on cost. And despite the fact that the Carrier 700 number itself is what it is, the focus on cost within the organization, G&A transformation is a major theme for us. We've set up these global centers of excellence. We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions, simplification across the portfolio, that will continue to be. 
And we have -- we've gone from $10 billion of net debt when we spun to now. We'll end, after we sell Chubb, to closer to $4 billion of net debt. So our ability to play offense on organic and inorganic growth is in a great place. So we'll continue to look at where we can really complement our existing portfolio to play offense. So we like our playbook. We like our focus.

And our investments in salespeople and things like digital R&D, that's all contributing. 
So that's -- we felt we were underrepresented on the sales side. We've added the, I think, the right number. And we did say that our total investment starts to modulate a bit as we go into next year. We're going to end up with 50 additional investments. Clearly, salespeople take some years -- take some time to pay back. But we look at it internally, we measure it on selling as a percentage of our gross margin. But pleased with the investment and the payback."

I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability",1573,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.  
I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and our strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives.  
Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued inflationary headwinds and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers, and I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues.  
You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax rate. Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs, while preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth.  
Our HVAC team more effectively manage price/cost, and that was reflected in its segment margins of 19.1%. Our Fire & Security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by chip shortages.  
The Refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continued to gain traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and cost, resulting in disappointing segment margins. I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to position us well for 2022.  
All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from 10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed, up 6% over 2019. We are also raising adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20, up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow.  
Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full year input cost pressure has now increased from about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically and strategically.  
Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on site at our suppliers. We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital tool.  
Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual sourcing of critical components. We will end 2021 with over 35%. We are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our acute focus, and we are working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing certain commodities to remain low cost and reduce logistics costs and complexity.  
We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year. We will have more than 3 million automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier Excellence to drive productivity.  
For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A.  
We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth, and you see our progress on Slide 4. Our North Star remains consistent, to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. In healthy buildings, we have over $350 million in orders and a pipeline of over $550 million, ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2.  
We are very well positioned to address our customers' sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential heating sales in North America are now heat pumps. We were honored to win a prestigious innovation award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with Greenspeed Intelligence, the industry's most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are now heat pumps, up from 15% 5 years ago, and we project this to be 50% within 5 years.  
We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. Its global warming potential is 70% lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers' energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy technologies. Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3 contributing to share gains.  
On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited with Dr. Scott Boden from Emory at his newly opened state-of-the-art health care facility. Carrier and Emory are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent and sustainable facility with the full suite of Carrier technologies: HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management, digital solutions and Abound, which ties it all together.  
Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck/trailer and shipping fleet customers are increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date, and we have a strong order book and pipeline. We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States to provide subscription-based telematics and reefer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from increased efficiencies, less downtime and lost products and overall lower energy consumption and costs.  
We continue to see progress on our 3 pillars of growth, with share gains, VRF, expanded geographic coverage and increased digitally enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I'll discuss more on Slide 5.  
Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year, and we are tracking to double-digit aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including spare parts, preventative maintenance, brake-fix repairs, mid-life modifications and upgrades, remote monitoring and other digital services.  
Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to Abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin parts sales with our national account customers in residential and light commercial HVAC.  
Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have 60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In Refrigeration, we signed a 3-year BlueEdge service contract with ScottsRL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet. Tangible progress on these strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top line sticky growth in 2022 and beyond.  
Another component of our growth is acquisitions. As you can see on Slide 6, we are making great progress in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including M&A, both focusing on digitally enabled recurring revenues. For example, Nlyte is complementary to our ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical.  
Nlyte Software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading technology, which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated heat. Together, we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling systems to optimize data center operations.  
Similarly, BrokerBay is complementary to our Supra business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high market share in locks that support residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication and actionable insights.  
BrokerBay brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds these sought-after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer response has been tremendous.  
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm company. Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood and carbon monoxide alarms, including the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our innovative residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation pipeline globally. The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline, and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities.  
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"
620281,1684665996,2445335,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7.  As expected, the results were very similar to Q2.

Please turn to Slide 7.  
As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that was offset by higher-than-expected input costs. All segments were on track to over-deliver on top line growth, but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and led to shipment delays and contributed to record backlogs.  
Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was 1 point tailwind for sales in the quarter and acquisitions, mainly Giwee,added another 2 points of growth. Given the unusually strong residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison. Nonetheless, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%.  
Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year, but was up about 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price/cost was modestly negative in the quarter.  
I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America. Fire & Security and Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases.  
Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages. Last year, Q3 benefited from timing around payables which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $146 million, and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year.  
In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge summarizing many of the points I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings. In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganizations to enable the pending Chubb sale triggering tax liabilities.  
On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or January.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about 2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC given the tough compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year. The result is that residential field inventories were down high single digits sequentially from the end of Q2.  
The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically.  
As expected, HVAC margins were down about 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions and the impact of additional pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bps from the second quarter and the segment remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year.  
Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter.  
Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China. Margins were up about 40 bps in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases as well as last year benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this segment. As Dave mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment, and we now expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected.  
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew about 2% as products were up about 3%, while field was flat. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential fire was down slightly, while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire were both up high single digits.  
Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year as last year benefited from the temporary cost actions. Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall margins for this segment to be in the [ mid-13 ] for the year.  
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial orders remained positive despite the very strong third quarter last year. Within that business, orders were down in residential in the high single digits on tough comparisons, but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point last year.  
Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5% sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck/trailer business remained solid and up about 15% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Europe. The order intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected high-teens organic sales growth for the year.  
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-over-year, with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire. Field orders were up mid- to high single digits organically.  
On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies, except in China. In China, HVAC orders were up in the mid-single digits while orders in Refrigeration and Fire & Security were down in the double digits.  
Let's move to Slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said last quarter, we are including Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year, which is higher than our prior 10% to 12% outlook.  
The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021 with price/cost being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price/cost in Q4.  
We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full year incremental investments are expected to be about $150 million, consistent with prior guidance. The Q3 discrete tax benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an updated 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the noncash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion.  
Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance. As you can see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate as higher volume is offset by price/cost. Just to note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter.  
In closing, the first 9 months of the year were strong, with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 14."

And let me start and Patrick can add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some onetime cost takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some onetime benefits we were doing seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which is what we're seeing is sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades. 
So what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we are price/cost-positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can and also being controlling the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance. We're driving productivity. We're managing commodities as best we can. 
So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique environment, we stay price/cost-positive. So we still mention where the Carrier 700 number is to make sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will form a bit of a reset. And then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are. 
The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focus every day on making sure that we control everything we can control on the cost side is still there, and it will never stop. What we'll do in our February 22 Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it going forward. But the underlying DNA of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier."

What we had said when we were forecasting like commercial coming into this year, as we reminded people that it's 80% replacement, 20% new. So there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of last year. Some of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong. 
We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse. K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back online, and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers. 
So when you look at all the different variables, orders up more than 40% year-over-year when we look at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020, and movement from our distributors into our end customer base remains in the double-digit range. And we just announced a price increase of up to 12%. So a lot to like in light commercial."

We want to be in China for China, and it's a very strategic market for us over the long term. 
If you look at the Evergrande situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities focused on multifamily residential, which is, for us, is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales. It's probably 0.5% of our sales, that specific area. So I think we're well -- and well calibrated on some of those issues.

And we previously thought the second half for us was going to be down 5% to 10%. 
So the good news is that movement continues to be positive. Field inventories, Patrick mentioned, sequentially was actually down 7% versus Q2. And even splits are down versus prior year. And our backlog, as I mentioned to Andrew, is up significantly over last quarter and even more significantly over previous year. 
So look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We look at October, orders continued to be strong. And all the underlying fundamentals with new housing starts this year is in the plus 13% range year-over-year. I think for the homebuilders, there's going to be some pushout into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us are seeing. 
But the work-from-home phenomenon, units kind of having a slightly shorter life, a lot of those underlying factors continue to give us some confidence as we go into next year.

You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has given us somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing, but that is changing now. And so as that window opens up and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that, one, the prices for these orders are higher; and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices change.

I'll talk about our current thoughts about 2022 rather than being quarter specific. But for planning purposes, we're actually including additional price increases to address the continued input cost headwinds and the hedges that are rolling off from which we benefited last year. As Dave mentioned, just in HVAC this week, we've announced price increases of up to 12% in residential and light commercial. I think it is safe to say that we're assuming input cost headwinds next year that exceeded the $375 million we're seeing this year. 
And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are about $375 million input cost. So we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing actions that we have taken this year, the carryover is about $350 million to $400 million. That excludes the additional price increases that we've announced this week in -- for resi and light commercial and excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our businesses. 
And so from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price/cost neutral. Of course, we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing."

I would say very -- completely consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Our first priority, fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, then funding a growing and sustainable dividend and then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase. What we mentioned last quarter with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt. That's kind of prorated from a capital structure point of view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb. 
What we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion. We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And what that would leave us at the end of this year, it will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year. And what we've said from a repurchase point of view is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months toward share repurchase. 
So that kind of gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I mentioned, priority #1 is funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant capital that we can put to work, and that's why we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made some acquisitions this year.

Any big delta between those 2 that you would want to make sure to point out for folks. Obviously, the Chubb divestiture would be one, but anything else you want to make sure to point out today?"

Tommy, Patrick here. I understand there are lots of moving pieces in conversion. And this year, particularly what's playing an important role is, one: some of the acquisitions we've made that in year 1 don't contribute yet as much earnings; two, the impact of currency. And then, of course, an important element this year is, of course, the whole price/cost dynamic, where we're adding this year pricing of well over $300 million for the full year, yet that is not falling through the bottom line. Of course, it has a negative impact on our conversion number. 
That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we don't want to get into that, good or bad. But from an operational point of view, we absolutely would still target earnings conversion in that high 20s to about 30% range. Depending on what do we do on the acquisition side, depending on price/cost, that might be slightly different. But operationally, that's absolutely something that we target and work towards. No change."

We said that we would invest in growth. And this year, despite all the input cost challenges, we're going to continue to invest $150 million in growth along the lines of our 3 pillars of growth, continue to grow the core and continue to look at adjacencies like VRF and geographic expansion like you saw with Cavius. 
And then continue to really lean into recurring revenues, aftermarket digital. We're in the first inning on that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will be very thematic for us certainly going into next year and for years to come. 
We said that we would be super aggressive on cost. And despite the fact that the Carrier 700 number itself is what it is, the focus on cost within the organization, G&A transformation is a major theme for us. We've set up these global centers of excellence. We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions, simplification across the portfolio, that will continue to be. 
And we have -- we've gone from $10 billion of net debt when we spun to now. We'll end, after we sell Chubb, to closer to $4 billion of net debt. So our ability to play offense on organic and inorganic growth is in a great place. So we'll continue to look at where we can really complement our existing portfolio to play offense. So we like our playbook. We like our focus. What we have to do is now transition from doing what we said we were going to do to doing best-in-class in everything we do, and that's going to be our focus in '22 and beyond."

So we will give specificity on cost carryover, inflationary pressures going into next year and how we're going to offset that at a minimum with price that, again, like Patrick said, being price/cost positive is our clear intent.

I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability",1573,"Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.  
I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and our strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives.  
Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued inflationary headwinds and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers, and I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues.  
You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax rate. Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs, while preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth.  
Our HVAC team more effectively manage price/cost, and that was reflected in its segment margins of 19.1%. Our Fire & Security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by chip shortages.  
The Refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continued to gain traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and cost, resulting in disappointing segment margins. I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to position us well for 2022.  
All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from 10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed, up 6% over 2019. We are also raising adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20, up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow.  
Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full year input cost pressure has now increased from about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically and strategically.  
Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on site at our suppliers. We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital tool.  
Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual sourcing of critical components. We will end 2021 with over 35%. We are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our acute focus, and we are working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing certain commodities to remain low cost and reduce logistics costs and complexity.  
We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year. We will have more than 3 million automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier Excellence to drive productivity.  
For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A.  
We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth, and you see our progress on Slide 4. Our North Star remains consistent, to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. In healthy buildings, we have over $350 million in orders and a pipeline of over $550 million, ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2.  
We are very well positioned to address our customers' sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential heating sales in North America are now heat pumps. We were honored to win a prestigious innovation award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with Greenspeed Intelligence, the industry's most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are now heat pumps, up from 15% 5 years ago, and we project this to be 50% within 5 years.  
We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. Its global warming potential is 70% lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers' energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy technologies. Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3 contributing to share gains.  
On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited with Dr. Scott Boden from Emory at his newly opened state-of-the-art health care facility. Carrier and Emory are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent and sustainable facility with the full suite of Carrier technologies: HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management, digital solutions and Abound, which ties it all together.  
Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck/trailer and shipping fleet customers are increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date, and we have a strong order book and pipeline. We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States to provide subscription-based telematics and reefer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from increased efficiencies, less downtime and lost products and overall lower energy consumption and costs.  
We continue to see progress on our 3 pillars of growth, with share gains, VRF, expanded geographic coverage and increased digitally enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I'll discuss more on Slide 5.  
Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year, and we are tracking to double-digit aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including spare parts, preventative maintenance, brake-fix repairs, mid-life modifications and upgrades, remote monitoring and other digital services.  
Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to Abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin parts sales with our national account customers in residential and light commercial HVAC.  
Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have 60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In Refrigeration, we signed a 3-year BlueEdge service contract with ScottsRL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet. Tangible progress on these strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top line sticky growth in 2022 and beyond.  
Another component of our growth is acquisitions. As you can see on Slide 6, we are making great progress in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including M&A, both focusing on digitally enabled recurring revenues. For example, Nlyte is complementary to our ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical.  
Nlyte Software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading technology, which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated heat. Together, we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling systems to optimize data center operations.  
Similarly, BrokerBay is complementary to our Supra business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high market share in locks that support residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication and actionable insights.  
BrokerBay brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds these sought-after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer response has been tremendous.  
Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm company. Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood and carbon monoxide alarms, including the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our innovative residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation pipeline globally. The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline, and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities.  
With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?"
620281,1684665996,2445349,"Carrier Global Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Carrier Global Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7.  As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that w",1450,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7.  
As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that was offset by higher-than-expected input costs. All segments were on track to over-deliver on top line growth, but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and led to shipment delays and contributed to record backlogs.  
Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was 1 point tailwind for sales in the quarter and acquisitions, mainly Giwee,added another 2 points of growth. Given the unusually strong residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison. Nonetheless, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%.  
Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year, but was up about 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price/cost was modestly negative in the quarter.  
I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America. Fire & Security and Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases.  
Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages. Last year, Q3 benefited from timing around payables which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in the quarter for $146 million, and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year.  
In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge summarizing many of the points I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings. In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganizations to enable the pending Chubb sale triggering tax liabilities.  
On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or January.  
Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about 2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC given the tough compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year. The result is that residential field inventories were down high single digits sequentially from the end of Q2.  
The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically.  
As expected, HVAC margins were down about 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions and the impact of additional pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bps from the second quarter and the segment remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year.  
Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter.  
Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China. Margins were up about 40 bps in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases as well as last year benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this segment. As Dave mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment, and we now expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected.  
Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew about 2% as products were up about 3%, while field was flat. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential fire was down slightly, while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire were both up high single digits.  
Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year as last year benefited from the temporary cost actions. Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall margins for this segment to be in the [ mid-13 ] for the year.  
Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our residential and light commercial orders remained positive despite the very strong third quarter last year. Within that business, orders were down in residential in the high single digits on tough comparisons, but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog in residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point last year.  
Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5% sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck/trailer business remained solid and up about 15% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Europe. The order intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected high-teens organic sales growth for the year.  
Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-over-year, with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire. Field orders were up mid- to high single digits organically.  
On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies, except in China. In China, HVAC orders were up in the mid-single digits while orders in Refrigeration and Fire & Security were down in the double digits.  
Let's move to Slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said last quarter, we are including Chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year, which is higher than our prior 10% to 12% outlook.  
The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021 with price/cost being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price/cost in Q4.  
We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full year incremental investments are expected to be about $150 million, consistent with prior guidance. The Q3 discrete tax benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an updated 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the noncash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion.  
Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance. As you can see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate as higher volume is offset by price/cost. Just to note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter.  
In closing, the first 9 months of the year were strong, with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 14."

And let me start and Patrick can add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some onetime cost takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some onetime benefits we were doing seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which is what we're seeing is sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades. 
So what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we are price/cost-positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can and also being controlling the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance. We're driving productivity. We're managing commodities as best we can. 
So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique environment, we stay price/cost-positive. So we still mention where the Carrier 700 number is to make sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will form a bit of a reset. And then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are. 
The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focus every day on making sure that we control everything we can control on the cost side is still there, and it will never stop. What we'll do in our February 22 Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it going forward. But the underlying DNA of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier."

What we had said when we were forecasting like commercial coming into this year, as we reminded people that it's 80% replacement, 20% new. So there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of last year. Some of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong. 
We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse. K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back online, and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers. 
So when you look at all the different variables, orders up more than 40% year-over-year when we look at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020, and movement from our distributors into our end customer base remains in the double-digit range.

We want to be in China for China, and it's a very strategic market for us over the long term. 
If you look at the Evergrande situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities focused on multifamily residential, which is, for us, is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales. It's probably 0.5% of our sales, that specific area. So I think we're well -- and well calibrated on some of those issues.

So look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We look at October, orders continued to be strong. And all the underlying fundamentals with new housing starts this year is in the plus 13% range year-over-year. I think for the homebuilders, there's going to be some pushout into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us are seeing.

So you noticed a very strong sales growth, double-digit growth in transport. CCR, Commercial Refrigeration, was about flat. But as we mentioned, the margin performance of this is disappointing given the strong sales growth. And so a focus in that segment now is a closer -- a better control on the cost side, but also, and I would say especially being more aggressive and timely on price increases. 
You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has given us somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing, but that is changing now. And so as that window opens up and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that, one, the prices for these orders are higher; and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices change. And so it's a significant focus for Tim White and the team."

With commercial HVAC, look, there's a lot of encouraging signs there as well. ABI, it's been higher than the Architectural Billing Index. It's been higher than 50 now for 8 consecutive months. Patrick mentioned that, overall, we were up mid-single digits. North America was kind of in line with that. Europe was a bit higher. China was a bit higher. Orders were up over 10% for commercial HVAC. 
And a really important thing for us is we really like our ALC controls business. That was up very strong. Those sales were up in the high teens, high margin, very differentiated, important business. And aftermarket has been very thematic for us, and we grew double digits there. So we're encouraged by commercial HVAC. Overall, when you look at just equipment applied orders, those were up 15%. So our key focus for CHVAC, like the rest of the portfolio, keep driving orders and then turn the world upside down to make sure we can deliver."

I'll talk about our current thoughts about 2022 rather than being quarter specific. But for planning purposes, we're actually including additional price increases to address the continued input cost headwinds and the hedges that are rolling off from which we benefited last year. As Dave mentioned, just in HVAC this week, we've announced price increases of up to 12% in residential and light commercial. I think it is safe to say that we're assuming input cost headwinds next year that exceeded the $375 million we're seeing this year. 
And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are about $375 million input cost. So we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing actions that we have taken this year, the carryover is about $350 million to $400 million. That excludes the additional price increases that we've announced this week in -- for resi and light commercial and excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our businesses. 
And so from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price/cost neutral. Of course, we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing."

I would say very -- completely consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Our first priority, fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, then funding a growing and sustainable dividend and then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase. What we mentioned last quarter with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt. That's kind of prorated from a capital structure point of view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb. 
What we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion. We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And what that would leave us at the end of this year, it will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year. And what we've said from a repurchase point of view is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months toward share repurchase. 
So that kind of gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I mentioned, priority #1 is funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant capital that we can put to work, and that's why we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made some acquisitions this year. We covered them in some of the slides. But there are some acquisitions that are a little bit larger in size in the pipeline as well. And so we're working hard on getting some of these onboard.

Of course, it has a negative impact on our conversion number. 
That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we don't want to get into that, good or bad. But from an operational point of view, we absolutely would still target earnings conversion in that high 20s to about 30% range.

And then continue to really lean into recurring revenues, aftermarket digital. We're in the first inning on that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will be very thematic for us certainly going into next year and for years to come. 
We said that we would be super aggressive on cost.

We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions, simplification across the portfolio, that will continue to be. 
And we have -- we've gone from $10 billion of net debt when we spun to now. We'll end, after we sell Chubb, to closer to $4 billion of net debt. So our ability to play offense on organic and inorganic growth is in a great place. So we'll continue to look at where we can really complement our existing portfolio to play offense.

Let me start, and then Patrick can kind of give some more specificity. The -- we have really tried to be as specific as we can on what's the pricing cost we're seeing by quarter, and we'll give it in that color next year. Carrier 700, when you see the kind of input costs we're seeing, it did change when it costs 10x as much to get a container out of China into the United States. When we're buying chips on the spot market, there have been some clear inflationary pressures that have affected the overall Carrier 700. 
Having said that, if you were to step foot in this building, you would see an entire war room focused on commodity management with our suppliers. You would see productivity being rolled out across the world. So we will give specificity on cost carryover, inflationary pressures going into next year and how we're going to offset that at a minimum with price that, again, like Patrick said, being price/cost positive is our clear intent. But the Carrier 700 number itself is lower this year than what we thought. Patrick, do you want to add to that?"

My guess is when you're dual-sourcing in this environment, it's actually -- I mean that's kind of like structurally higher cost, you're trading off higher cost for availability. I mean is that the right way to look at it?"

And our investments in salespeople and things like digital R&D, that's all contributing. 
So that's -- we felt we were underrepresented on the sales side. We've added the, I think, the right number. And we did say that our total investment starts to modulate a bit as we go into next year. We're going to end up with 50 additional investments. Clearly, salespeople take some years -- take some time to pay back. But we look at it internally, we measure it on selling as a percentage of our gross margin. But pleased with the investment and the payback."
