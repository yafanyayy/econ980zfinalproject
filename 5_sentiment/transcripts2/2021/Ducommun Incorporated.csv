Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, an",1409,"Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March of last year. We continue to work with the authorities on best practices throughout our many operations. The amount of cases now is 188 for the company since last March. We remain diligent on communications with weekly updates through our human resources team. As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's fourth quarter results really shined and despite the continued unprecedented challenges in the commercial aerospace markets. All of our actions, initiatives, and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results and again in Q4. Our defense business continues to be a major contributor, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, strong operating leadership, and leveraging our lean and highly focused performance centers. This is particularly evident in the margin expansions for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA despite the massive year-over-year headwind. Team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 8%, in line with expectations. Quality of our earnings, too, was very high, with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 a share versus $0.75 a share for Q4 2019 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.89 a share versus $0.80 in 2019. These numbers were reached despite overall revenue being down 15.6% from Q4 last year. A job well done. This is a great story for our investors as we see a return to growth in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering. And the solid results in 2020 will benefit the future numbers. The company's fourth quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets and roughly at the midpoint of our expectations of being down between 14% and 18%, which was communicated in our last earnings call. Ducommun's common defense business, however, again, showed great strength, being up 25% versus prior year, and again, was a result of the many improvements that we started back in 2018. Our timing was excellent. Though not ever wanting to show a negative growth, the revenue number is also impressive to not only the pandemic impact but also overcoming another $24 million of 737 MAX headwind in Q4. Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress on shipments and business development. The majority of the gains in Q4 included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases from our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, F-35, MIR, and the Raytheon total program. I mentioned on our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, and they're not reaching $1 million in revenue in December 2020, as we had hoped. The number was still strong, and shipments in 2021 for this customer will be over 4x versus last year. In regard to defense backlog, we set an all-time record for Ducommun, ending Q4 with a backlog of $530 million. The total backlog was $822 million for the company, sequentially up from Q3, and it's a great number based on the environment. Defense business grew year-over-year by 25%, bolstered by strong revenues across numerous key platforms, which included F-35, Patriot, the TOW Missile, Mir [ph] Missile, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles, and others as this is part of -- as this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, this strength help offset commercial RSP orders, which we anticipate will start increasing in 2021. Defense results also show great opportunities where we can leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. We have major wins now in the TOW Missile, which I've spoken about and other new programs. And along with acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $100 million in revenue for 2021. I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment was under-managed in the past. But now with structural applications going full speed, along with a long-term track record and value offering of our electronic systems business, we see a strong future. As in Q3, cost actions have continued in Q4. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in the positive gross profit margin expansion year-over-year and solid operating income percentage along with EPS. Team did a great job in 2020, moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic related costs incurred, including major restructuring or impairments.In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide strong revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenues will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead, we will see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We have the capacity, the strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single-aisle aircraft. We also see Ducommun's titanium business of hot form and superplastic forming leading this comeback as well. We are a leader in this area with only OEM operations we know of at Airbus. Ducommun has a strong position in titanium already at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulfstream, and among others. And you know we have the operating -- we know we've been reporting over the past few years our efforts to evolve a significant franchise with Airbus, which continues to grow well. As mentioned on our last call, we will return to growth in 2021, with the first quarter still having a tough compare and being down year-over-year. The other 3 quarters will see good growth versus 2020, and we anticipate overall revenue for the year Ducommun growing low to mid-single digits.Ducommun also has a great long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense portfolio spoken about earlier, which now is currently 52 programs above $1 million in yearly revenue, and that's up from $34 million in 2017. That's over a 50% increase. Also, Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body, with roughly a 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, our titanium market leadership, along with share gain at Airbus, will drive excellent growth as the market recovers. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well. And finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. Now, let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $115.4 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 25%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms, including most of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, Patriot, GA, F-35, Mir, and the TOW missile. The fourth quarter military and space revenue represented 73% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the fourth quarter with an all-time high backlog record of $530 million, which is up 17% year-over-year, and it also represents 65% of our current backlog. Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.2 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun will begin to recover in this market in 2021. As mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $268 million at the end of Q4, with the majority of the decline due to the 737 MAX. With that, Chris will review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-K and Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results once again underscore the diversity of our business and focus on bottom line performance resulting in our posting of strong results during the pandemic for which we're certainly proud. Now, I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2020. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $157.8 million versus $186.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline largely reflects $42.4 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace customers, $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial market, partially offset by $23.2 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector. The continued theme for the year as our commercial platform saw a significant decrease in the demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on Ducommun's customers and air travel in general. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $822 million, representing sequential growth from Q3 in military and space orders, while our commercial backlog was flat quarter-over-quarter. Our defense backlog rose to almost $530 million, a record for the company. As a result -- as a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. We posted total gross profit of $34.8 million versus $40.1 million in the prior year period, while gross margins rose to 22.1% from 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The margin increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix, particularly within our electronic systems segment, more than offsetting the negative impact of lower manufacturing volumes and higher compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $24.9 million last year, once again, reflecting our tight cost controls and streamline operations. Ducommun reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.6 million or 7.3% of revenue compared to $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, net of restructure charges, accounting adjustments, and other onetime items was $12.9 million this quarter or 8.2% of revenue compared to $15.8 million or 8.4% of revenue in the comparable period of 2019. Interest expense was $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $5.2 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to the company's drawdown of $50 million in the first quarter to have its cash on hand during the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back $25 million during the fourth quarter, leaving $25 million outstanding at year-end. This remained as cash on hand. The company's net income for the fourth quarter was $9.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was due to $2.6 million of lower interest expense, $2.4 million of reduced SG&A, and $1.6 million of lower income tax expense, partially offset by the $5.3 million decrease in gross profit. Excluding restructuring expenses and other onetime costs, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.89 versus $0.80 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $22.8 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, reflecting the items I just discussed. Now, let me turn to the segment results. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $99.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $96.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $17.6 million increase in the company's military and space customers, largely offset by $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial customers and $4.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.5 million or 11.6% of revenue versus $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue in the prior year period. This performance primarily reflects improved product mix. Excluding restructuring charges in this year's fourth quarter, adjusted operating income was 11.8% of revenue. Our structural systems segment posted $58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects $37.6 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by $5.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military based markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline was due to unfavorable manufacturing volumes and mix. Excluding restructuring charges and onetime accounting adjustments in both years, adjusted operating margin was 12.4% in 2020 and 13.4% in 2019. Corporate, general, and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6.1 million or 3.9% of revenue and $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue in 2019. We have $56 million cash on hand and $75 million on our available credit line when we talk about our liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we generated $11.1 million of cash from operations with $31 million in the prior year period. We expect to return to a much stronger and more normalized cash flow generation during 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 2.9 at year-end. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.3 million during the fourth quarter and $12.5 million for the year, a significant decrease from 2019. Going forward, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in 2021 for ongoing product and customer support. Our full year effective tax rate came in at a very favorable rate as expected. The effective tax rate was roughly 9%. The main impact related to FIN 48 releases during the fourth quarter. Overall, we believe our performance last year during such challenging circumstances speaks volumes. It underscores the versatility of our streamlined operations, the dedication of our staff, the strength of our product lines, and diversity of the customer base. We believe this puts us on solid footing for 2021 and beyond and look forward to meeting any remaining challenges this year while continuing to post superior results for our shareholders. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today,",1410,"Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. 
As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March of last year. We continue to work with the authorities on best practices throughout our many operations. 
The amount of cases now is 188 for the company since last March. We remain diligent on communications with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's fourth quarter results really shined and despite the continued unprecedented challenges in the commercial aerospace markets. All of our actions, initiatives, and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results and again in Q4. 
Our defense business continues to be a major contributor, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, strong operating leadership, and leveraging our lean and highly focused performance centers. This is particularly evident in the margin expansions for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA despite the massive year-over-year headwind. 
Team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 8%, in line with expectations. Quality of our earnings, too, was very high, with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 a share versus $0.75 a share for Q4 2019 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.89 a share versus $0.80 in 2019. These numbers were reached despite overall revenue being down 15.6% from Q4 last year. A job well done. 
This is a great story for our investors as we see a return to growth in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering. And the solid results in 2020 will benefit the future numbers. 
The company's fourth quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets and roughly at the midpoint of our expectations of being down between 14% and 18%, which was communicated in our last earnings call. 
Ducommun's common defense business, however, again, showed great strength, being up 25% versus prior year, and again, was a result of the many improvements that we started back in 2018. Our timing was excellent. Though not ever wanting to show a negative growth, the revenue number is also impressive to not only the pandemic impact but also overcoming another $24 million of 737 MAX headwind in Q4. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress on shipments and business development. The majority of the gains in Q4 included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases from our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, F-35, MIR, and the Raytheon total program. 
I mentioned on our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, and they're not reaching $1 million in revenue in December 2020, as we had hoped. The number was still strong, and shipments in 2021 for this customer will be over 4x versus last year. 
In regard to defense backlog, we set an all-time record for Ducommun, ending Q4 with a backlog of $530 million. The total backlog was $822 million for the company, sequentially up from Q3, and it's a great number based on the environment. 
Defense business grew year-over-year by 25%, bolstered by strong revenues across numerous key platforms, which included F-35, Patriot, the TOW Missile, Mir [ph] Missile, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles, and others as this is part of -- as this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, this strength help offset commercial RSP orders, which we anticipate will start increasing in 2021. 
Defense results also show great opportunities where we can leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. We have major wins now in the TOW Missile, which I've spoken about and other new programs. And along with acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $100 million in revenue for 2021. 
I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment was under-managed in the past. But now with structural applications going full speed, along with a long-term track record and value offering of our electronic systems business, we see a strong future. 
As in Q3, cost actions have continued in Q4. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in the positive gross profit margin expansion year-over-year and solid operating income percentage along with EPS. Team did a great job in 2020, moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred, including major restructuring or impairments.
In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide strong revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenues will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead, we will see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We have the capacity, the strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single-aisle aircraft. 
We also see Ducommun's titanium business of hot form and superplastic forming leading this comeback as well. We are a leader in this area with only OEM operations we know of at Airbus. Ducommun has a strong position in titanium already at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulfstream, and among others. And you know we have the operating -- we know we've been reporting over the past few years our efforts to evolve a significant franchise with Airbus, which continues to grow well. 
As mentioned on our last call, we will return to growth in 2021, with the first quarter still having a tough compare and being down year-over-year. The other 3 quarters will see good growth versus 2020, and we anticipate overall revenue for the year Ducommun growing low to mid-single digits.
Ducommun also has a great long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense portfolio spoken about earlier, which now is currently 52 programs above $1 million in yearly revenue, and that's up from $34 million in 2017. That's over a 50% increase. 
Also, Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body, with roughly a 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, our titanium market leadership, along with share gain at Airbus, will drive excellent growth as the market recovers. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well. 
And finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now, let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $115.4 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 25%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms, including most of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, Patriot, GA, F-35, Mir, and the TOW missile. 
The fourth quarter military and space revenue represented 73% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the fourth quarter with an all-time high backlog record of $530 million, which is up 17% year-over-year, and it also represents 65% of our current backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.2 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun will begin to recover in this market in 2021. As mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $268 million at the end of Q4, with the majority of the decline due to the 737 MAX. 
With that, Chris will review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-K and Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results once again underscore",1076,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-K and Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results once again underscore the diversity of our business and focus on bottom line performance resulting in our posting of strong results during the pandemic for which we're certainly proud. Now, I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2020. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $157.8 million versus $186.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline largely reflects $42.4 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace customers, $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial market, partially offset by $23.2 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector. The continued theme for the year as our commercial platform saw a significant decrease in the demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on Ducommun's customers and air travel in general. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $822 million, representing sequential growth from Q3 in military and space orders, while our commercial backlog was flat quarter-over-quarter. Our defense backlog rose to almost $530 million, a record for the company. As a result -- as a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted total gross profit of $34.8 million versus $40.1 million in the prior year period, while gross margins rose to 22.1% from 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The margin increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix, particularly within our electronic systems segment, more than offsetting the negative impact of lower manufacturing volumes and higher compensation benefit costs. 
SG&A was $22.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $24.9 million last year, once again, reflecting our tight cost controls and streamline operations. Ducommun reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.6 million or 7.3% of revenue compared to $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. 
Adjusted operating income, net of restructure charges, accounting adjustments, and other onetime items was $12.9 million this quarter or 8.2% of revenue compared to $15.8 million or 8.4% of revenue in the comparable period of 2019. Interest expense was $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $5.2 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. 
The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to the company's drawdown of $50 million in the first quarter to have its cash on hand during the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back $25 million during the fourth quarter, leaving $25 million outstanding at year-end. This remained as cash on hand. 
The company's net income for the fourth quarter was $9.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was due to $2.6 million of lower interest expense, $2.4 million of reduced SG&A, and $1.6 million of lower income tax expense, partially offset by the $5.3 million decrease in gross profit. 
Excluding restructuring expenses and other onetime costs, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.89 versus $0.80 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $22.8 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, reflecting the items I just discussed. Now, let me turn to the segment results. 
Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $99.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $96.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $17.6 million increase in the company's military and space customers, largely offset by $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial customers and $4.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. 
Electronic systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.5 million or 11.6% of revenue versus $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue in the prior year period. This performance primarily reflects improved product mix. Excluding restructuring charges in this year's fourth quarter, adjusted operating income was 11.8% of revenue. 
Our structural systems segment posted $58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects $37.6 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by $5.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military-based markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline was due to unfavorable manufacturing volumes and mix. Excluding restructuring charges and onetime accounting adjustments in both years, adjusted operating margin was 12.4% in 2020 and 13.4% in 2019. 
Corporate, general, and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6.1 million or 3.9% of revenue and $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue in 2019. We have $56 million cash on hand and $75 million on our available credit line when we talk about our liquidity and capital resources. 
During the quarter, we generated $11.1 million of cash from operations with $31 million in the prior year period. We expect to return to a much stronger and more normalized cash flow generation during 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 2.9 at year-end. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.3 million during the fourth quarter and $12.5 million for the year, a significant decrease from 2019. Going forward, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in 2021 for ongoing product and customer support. 
Our full year effective tax rate came in at a very favorable rate as expected. The effective tax rate was roughly 9%. The main impact related to FIN 48 releases during the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we believe our performance last year during such challenging circumstances speaks volumes. It underscores the versatility of our streamlined operations, the dedication of our staff, the strength of our product lines, and diversity of the customer base. We believe this puts us on solid footing for 2021 and beyond and look forward to meeting any remaining challenges this year while continuing to post superior results for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As in the Q3 call, I also want to thank our customers, shareholders, all other business partners for their continued support as we work through these difficult times together. We've also now, as we mentioned earlier, given out quite a bit of money through our Ducommun Foundation, up over $1.3 million for local charities, where we operate to help our neighbors and community. 
In 2020, we have partnered as well with 2 organizations to help improve the quality in our nation and assist small business recovery due to the social unrest in the past in Los Angeles. 
And first and foremost, in closing, I'd like to, again, this quarter, take this time to thank Ducommun employees and my team. I'm proud of them, all their efforts, dealing with the many challenges from the pandemic in 2020 and delivering. Our team showed up every day at our operations, though stressful, and got the job done for our customers and for our nation.

267761,702572021,2209675,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today,",1410,"Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. 
As in our second and third quarter calls, I first hope you and your families are healthy, continue to get through this pandemic as best as possible. Today, and as usual, I will give an update of the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
The company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March of last year. We continue to work with the authorities on best practices throughout our many operations. 
The amount of cases now is 188 for the company since last March. We remain diligent on communications with weekly updates through our human resources team. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's fourth quarter results really shined and despite the continued unprecedented challenges in the commercial aerospace markets. All of our actions, initiatives, and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown in the strong operating results and again in Q4. 
Our defense business continues to be a major contributor, along with cost reductions, having the right product portfolio, strong operating leadership, and leveraging our lean and highly focused performance centers. This is particularly evident in the margin expansions for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA despite the massive year-over-year headwind. 
Team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 8%, in line with expectations. Quality of our earnings, too, was very high, with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.80 a share versus $0.75 a share for Q4 2019 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.89 a share versus $0.80 in 2019. These numbers were reached despite overall revenue being down 15.6% from Q4 last year. A job well done. 
This is a great story for our investors as we see a return to growth in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering. And the solid results in 2020 will benefit the future numbers. 
The company's fourth quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets and roughly at the midpoint of our expectations of being down between 14% and 18%, which was communicated in our last earnings call. 
Ducommun's common defense business, however, again, showed great strength, being up 25% versus prior year, and again, was a result of the many improvements that we started back in 2018. Our timing was excellent. Though not ever wanting to show a negative growth, the revenue number is also impressive to not only the pandemic impact but also overcoming another $24 million of 737 MAX headwind in Q4. 
Ducommun's defense business continues to show excellent progress on shipments and business development. The majority of the gains in Q4 included radar systems for Northrop Grumman, increases from our new weapon systems business, Nobles Worldwide, along with the Patriot, UAVs at General Atomics, F-35, MIR, and the Raytheon total program. 
I mentioned on our last call about Ducommun's new efforts with UAVs. Again, we are thrilled to be a strategic partner with GA, and they're not reaching $1 million in revenue in December 2020, as we had hoped. The number was still strong, and shipments in 2021 for this customer will be over 4x versus last year. 
In regard to defense backlog, we set an all-time record for Ducommun, ending Q4 with a backlog of $530 million. The total backlog was $822 million for the company, sequentially up from Q3, and it's a great number based on the environment. 
Defense business grew year-over-year by 25%, bolstered by strong revenues across numerous key platforms, which included F-35, Patriot, the TOW Missile, Mir [ph] Missile, UAVs, weapon systems for ground vehicles at Nobles, and others as this is part of -- as this part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously, this strength help offset commercial RSP orders, which we anticipate will start increasing in 2021. 
Defense results also show great opportunities where we can leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. We have major wins now in the TOW Missile, which I've spoken about and other new programs. And along with acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $100 million in revenue for 2021. 
I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment was under-managed in the past. But now with structural applications going full speed, along with a long-term track record and value offering of our electronic systems business, we see a strong future. 
As in Q3, cost actions have continued in Q4. You can certainly see the effectiveness of our actions in the positive gross profit margin expansion year-over-year and solid operating income percentage along with EPS. Team did a great job in 2020, moving quickly and managing this difficult environment with no material pandemic-related costs incurred, including major restructuring or impairments.
In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier, will provide strong revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenues will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead, we will see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We have the capacity, the strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single-aisle aircraft. 
We also see Ducommun's titanium business of hot form and superplastic forming leading this comeback as well. We are a leader in this area with only OEM operations we know of at Airbus. Ducommun has a strong position in titanium already at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulfstream, and among others. And you know we have the operating -- we know we've been reporting over the past few years our efforts to evolve a significant franchise with Airbus, which continues to grow well. 
As mentioned on our last call, we will return to growth in 2021, with the first quarter still having a tough compare and being down year-over-year. The other 3 quarters will see good growth versus 2020, and we anticipate overall revenue for the year Ducommun growing low to mid-single digits.
Ducommun also has a great long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense portfolio spoken about earlier, which now is currently 52 programs above $1 million in yearly revenue, and that's up from $34 million in 2017. That's over a 50% increase. 
Also, Ducommun's strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body, with roughly a 2:1 ratio with wide-bodies, our titanium market leadership, along with share gain at Airbus, will drive excellent growth as the market recovers. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well. 
And finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future. 
Now, let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $115.4 million, once again representing strong growth versus 2019, up 25%. We drove revenue across a broad variety of defense platforms, including most of our product portfolio. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for our military fixed-wing aircraft programs, with particularly strong revenue, as mentioned, from Northrop Grumman, Nobles Worldwide, Patriot, GA, F-35, Mir, and the TOW missile. 
The fourth quarter military and space revenue represented 73% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for future growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors. And again, ended the fourth quarter with an all-time high backlog record of $530 million, which is up 17% year-over-year, and it also represents 65% of our current backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.2 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on the 737 MAX as well as many other programs impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn is well positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun will begin to recover in this market in 2021. As mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $268 million at the end of Q4, with the majority of the decline due to the 737 MAX. 
With that, Chris will review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-K and Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-K and Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. 
As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results once again underscore the diversity of our business and focus on bottom line performance resulting in our posting of strong results during the pandemic for which we're certainly proud. Now, I'll move to the details of our overall results. Review of the fourth quarter 2020. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $157.8 million versus $186.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline largely reflects $42.4 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace customers, $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial market, partially offset by $23.2 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector. The continued theme for the year as our commercial platform saw a significant decrease in the demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on Ducommun's customers and air travel in general. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $822 million, representing sequential growth from Q3 in military and space orders, while our commercial backlog was flat quarter-over-quarter. Our defense backlog rose to almost $530 million, a record for the company. As a result -- as a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted total gross profit of $34.8 million versus $40.1 million in the prior year period, while gross margins rose to 22.1% from 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The margin increase year-over-year was due to favorable product mix, particularly within our electronic systems segment, more than offsetting the negative impact of lower manufacturing volumes and higher compensation benefit costs. 
SG&A was $22.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $24.9 million last year, once again, reflecting our tight cost controls and streamline operations. Ducommun reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.6 million or 7.3% of revenue compared to $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue in the prior year period. 
Adjusted operating income, net of restructure charges, accounting adjustments, and other onetime items was $12.9 million this quarter or 8.2% of revenue compared to $15.8 million or 8.4% of revenue in the comparable period of 2019. Interest expense was $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $5.2 million in the prior year period as lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. 
The increased debt outstanding was primarily due to the company's drawdown of $50 million in the first quarter to have its cash on hand during the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back $25 million during the fourth quarter, leaving $25 million outstanding at year-end. This remained as cash on hand. 
The company's net income for the fourth quarter was $9.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was due to $2.6 million of lower interest expense, $2.4 million of reduced SG&A, and $1.6 million of lower income tax expense, partially offset by the $5.3 million decrease in gross profit. 
Excluding restructuring expenses and other onetime costs, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.89 versus $0.80 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $22.8 million or 14.4% of revenue compared to $25.2 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable period in 2019, reflecting the items I just discussed. Now, let me turn to the segment results. 
Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $99.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $96.3 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $17.6 million increase in the company's military and space customers, largely offset by $10.1 million lower revenue within the company's industrial customers and $4.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. 
Electronic systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $11.5 million or 11.6% of revenue versus $9.9 million or 10.2% of revenue in the prior year period. This performance primarily reflects improved product mix. Excluding restructuring charges in this year's fourth quarter, adjusted operating income was 11.8% of revenue. 
Our structural systems segment posted $58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $90.6 million last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects $37.6 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by $5.7 million of higher revenue within the company's military-based markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $6.2 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11.6 million or 12.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decline was due to unfavorable manufacturing volumes and mix. Excluding restructuring charges and onetime accounting adjustments in both years, adjusted operating margin was 12.4% in 2020 and 13.4% in 2019. 
Corporate, general, and administrative expense. CG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6.1 million or 3.9% of revenue and $6.3 million or 3.4% of revenue in 2019. We have $56 million cash on hand and $75 million on our available credit line when we talk about our liquidity and capital resources. 
During the quarter, we generated $11.1 million of cash from operations with $31 million in the prior year period. We expect to return to a much stronger and more normalized cash flow generation during 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA was 2.9 at year-end. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.3 million during the fourth quarter and $12.5 million for the year, a significant decrease from 2019. Going forward, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in 2021 for ongoing product and customer support. 
Our full year effective tax rate came in at a very favorable rate as expected. The effective tax rate was roughly 9%. The main impact related to FIN 48 releases during the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we believe our performance last year during such challenging circumstances speaks volumes. It underscores the versatility of our streamlined operations, the dedication of our staff, the strength of our product lines, and diversity of the customer base. We believe this puts us on solid footing for 2021 and beyond and look forward to meeting any remaining challenges this year while continuing to post superior results for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

But if you just look at our level of penetration at some of these defense primes, I mean, it's still pretty low. So -- I mean if we can have a company like a defense prime like Raytheon with those kind of numbers, I mean, why can't we have with Northrop? And why can't we have it at Lockheed? 
So I see share shift, I see new programs. And the nice thing about our portfolio is that we're delivering at a high level, high service levels, really good quality, and people are trusting us more and more. So I think it's all -- all bodes well for the future."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks everyone for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. As in our prior quarter calls, I hope you and your families are healthy, for those that have received vaccines that have went or is going well. And we all get through this pandemic as best and fast as possible. Today and as usual, I will give an update on the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company ratings focus first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. Team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March 2020. We continue to work with authorities on best practice throughout our operations. Now, the cases at Ducommun is roughly 200. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen a significant drop-off starting in February of this year, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team.
As mentioned in the press release 2 comments, First quarter results are strong despite the continued challenges and the commercial aerospace markets, which we're all aware of. All the actions, initiatives, and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown strong operating results, especially since last March and again, in Q1. Our defense business continues to be the major contributor as we build out this important segment of the company for scale, which includes having the right product portfolio, strong operating metrics, leveraging our lean, highly focused performance center concept.
This particularly evident to continue margin strength for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, despite the significant year-over-year headwind. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 7%. Quality of earning too was very high, with the company reaching GAAP, diluted EPS of 55 cents a share versus 67 cents a share for Q1, 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of 58 cents a share versus 67 in 2020. These numbers are reads despite overall revenue down 9% from Q1 last year. It's a job well done. This is also a great story for our investors. As we see a return to revenue growth overall in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering, solid results in Q1 will benefit the rest of the year. The company's first quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets. However, Ducommun's business again showed strengthening of 12% versus prior year. And again was the result of many improvements starting back in 2018.
Do not ever want it to show a negative growth. The overall river revenue numbers are impressive despite the pandemic impact on commercial aerospace in the quarter, we're looking forward to Q2 and posting year-over-year growth for the first time in a while, Ducommun's defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and robust business development. Majority of gains in Q1 include the Raytheon TOW program, radar systems for Northrop Grumman, UAVs at General Atomics and other missile programs. Again, as we have stated in the past, We are thrilled to be a strategic supplier with GA and reached $1 million in revenue in March this year for the first time. And shipments in 2021 will be able over 4X versus 2020. I also want to mention Raytheon Missile and Defense, and the progress in signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. we've been hard at work with new programs and share shift where we can provide value and I'm happy to report 2021 will be a record year overall with the legacy Raytheon businesses grind from less than 90 million in 2020 to over 125 million in 2021, in increases almost 40%.
Regards to the defense backlog, it remained strong, ending Q1 with a backlog of 516 million. Total backlog for the company was 810 million. And this is a great number based on the environment. The defense business grew year-over-year by 8.8%, bolstered by strong revenues and some key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, UAV and other programs as part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously the strength help offset commercial aerospace order pressure, but we anticipate that to start increasing in the second half of 2021. So the press results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs, as mentioned previously, we have wins now on the TOW missile, which was a share shift from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile to dorsal fin assembly. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be worth of a 110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under 80 million in 2019.
I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward, despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment has been under managed in the past, as I've mentioned, but now its structural applications going full speed ahead, along with a long track record and value off any of our electronic systems business. We see a strong future. One other very important metric is that our defense portfolio currently has 48 programs at the end of Q1, above a million in yearly revenue. Up from 34 in 2017, there were 40% increase. The company's cost actions through Q1 2020 are also paying dividends. You can certainly see the effect of this, our actions in the continued strong, gross profit margins year-over-year, and the solid operating income percentage along with diluted EPS. Team did a great job in 2020 on costs and is now extending into 2021 in Q1. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide strong revenue for the remainder of 2021.
Provide strong revenue for the remainder of 2021. We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead we see more commercial aerospace volume return to the Comet. We have the capacity, a strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single aisle aircraft. We stand ready as well with our strong narrow-body platform positions, which Comet's titanium businesses, a platform and super plastic forming leading the way. As I've mentioned the past, we are the world leader in this area and have strong positions already at Airbus, Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulf Stream, and among other OEMs.
Comet also has recognize as now included in the Boeing Premiere Bitters Program, meaning all of this OEM's criteria. And I also want to send my congratulations to our team supporting Airbus, by reaching 100% on-time delivery performance for 2 years straight in April 2021. That's a real achievement.
As mentioned in our last call, we will returned to growth in 2021 with the first quarter being down year-over-year, but now that is behind us. The other 3 quarters we'll see good momentum versus 2020. And we anticipate overall revenue for the year to come is growing low to mid-single digits.
Comet also has a great mid-term and long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense business and strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, as we have a 2:1 ratio versus double aisle aircraft. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well. Finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of 114.1 million. Once again representing strong growth versus 2020, up 12%. Built revenue on some key defense platforms. I mentioned earlier, we saw our increases in demand on our tow missile, UAV, and other missile programs. First quarter's military and space revenue represented 73% of the Comet's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon and GA. And again, ended the first quarter with a strong back look at 516 million, which is up 8.8% year-over-year, represents almost 64% of the Comet's backlog.
Then our commercial aerospace operation first quarter revenue declined year-over-year to 35.4 million, as expected driven by build rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Comet also has effectively adjusted costs and managed downturn as well-positioned once rates stabilized and increase over the long term.
Comet will begin to recover in this market in the second half of 2021. As mentioned earlier, it has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector, spans at roughly 266 million at the end of the first quarter, for the majority of the clients due to the 737 Max program. We do, however, stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place, to support the bill rate increases in the next few years. And we're anxious to get started.
With that I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, w",991,"Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, we continued to demonstrate our ability to perform well at reduced volume levels, which we have had since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic over one year ago. We're looking forward to leveraging the expected increase in demand for our commercial aircraft components and systems, as well as the strength of our defense business as we return to growth in 2021.
Now turning to our first quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was 157.2 million versus 173.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decline reflects 25.2 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms and a decrease in our industrial business, partially offset by 12.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector.
Comet's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 810 million. As a reminder, we defined backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm, fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of 33.1 million for the quarter versus 36.8 million in the prior year period. While gross margins were essentially flat year-over-year, 21.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 versus 21.2% last year, the headwind from significantly lower manufacturing volumes was largely offset by improved product mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. SG&A was 22.5 million in the first quarter versus 23.2 million last year, reflecting the company's ongoing cost controls with streamlined operations.
Comet reported operating income for the first quarter of 10.6 million, or 6.8% of revenue compared to 13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, excluding expenses related to the previous reported Guaymas fire, was 11.1 million or 7.1% of revenue with the year-over-year performance, largely reflecting the impact of lower volumes.
Interest expense was 2.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus 4.2 million in the prior year period, as the lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. The debt outstanding rose due to the company's cash draw down of $50 million last year to have on hand as we worked through the impact of the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back 25 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 and another 5 million in Q1, leaving 20 million outstanding.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of 6.7 million or 55 cents per diluted share. Compared to net income of 7.9 million or 67 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses, adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was 58 cents. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 21.1 million or 13.5% of revenue, compared to 23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of 99.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus 98.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a 7.4 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers, somewhat offset by 3.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms along with lower industrial sales.
Electronic systems operating income for the first quarter was 12.5 million or 12.6% of revenue versus 15.1 million or 15.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The lower margin was primarily a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs.
Our structural system segment posted revenue of 58 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus 75.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects 22.1 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by 4.8 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.
Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 5.1 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to 5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin increase was primarily due to favorable product mix and excluding the Guaymas charges, first quarter adjusted operating margin was 9.7% in 2021. Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expense, for the first quarter of 2021 was 7 million or 4.5% of revenue and 6.9 million or 4% of revenue in 2020. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have 17 million in cash on hand and 80 million available on our revolver, resulting in available liquidity of 97 million. We utilized 23 million of cash from operations this quarter compared to with utilizing 12 million in the prior year period. The first quarter typically results in a cash outflow from operations as we pay annual incentives and invest in working capital to support expected business growth. We expect to return to historical cash flow generation levels as we move through the rest of 2021. Our 12 month debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.4 at the end of the first quarter. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent 4.5 million during the first quarter, reflecting a return to more normal investment levels and aligned with our return to growth in 2021. We anticipate spending between 16 million to 18 million in 2021 to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.
In conclusion, we believe our performance this quarter was solid and stable, reflecting the company's lean operations, diverse customer base and strong military demand. For 2021, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about a return to growth in commercial volumes during the second half, as Steve indicated. We'll discuss these trends further at our upcoming investor day on May 26. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks everyone for joining us today for our first quarter conference call.

Thank you, Chris, and thanks everyone for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. As in our prior quarter calls, I hope you and your families are healthy, for those that have received vaccines that have went or is going well. And we all get through this pandemic as best and fast as possible. Today and as usual, I will give an update on the current situation at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company ratings focus first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees. Team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March 2020. We continue to work with authorities on best practice throughout our operations. Now, the cases at Ducommun is roughly 200. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen a significant drop-off starting in February of this year, and we remain diligent on communication with weekly updates through our human resources team.
As mentioned in the press release 2 comments, First quarter results are strong despite the continued challenges and the commercial aerospace markets, which we're all aware of. All the actions, initiatives, and hard work since we began this journey in 2017 have shown strong operating results, especially since last March and again, in Q1. Our defense business continues to be the major contributor as we build out this important segment of the company for scale, which includes having the right product portfolio, strong operating metrics, leveraging our lean, highly focused performance center concept.
This particularly evident to continue margin strength for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, despite the significant year-over-year headwind. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 7%. Quality of earning too was very high, with the company reaching GAAP, diluted EPS of 55 cents a share versus 67 cents a share for Q1, 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of 58 cents a share versus 67 in 2020. These numbers are reads despite overall revenue down 9% from Q1 last year. It's a job well done. This is also a great story for our investors. As we see a return to revenue growth overall in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering, solid results in Q1 will benefit the rest of the year. The company's first quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets. However, Ducommun's business again showed strengthening of 12% versus prior year. And again was the result of many improvements starting back in 2018.
Do not ever want it to show a negative growth. The overall river revenue numbers are impressive despite the pandemic impact on commercial aerospace in the quarter, we're looking forward to Q2 and posting year-over-year growth for the first time in a while, Ducommun's defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and robust business development. Majority of gains in Q1 include the Raytheon TOW program, radar systems for Northrop Grumman, UAVs at General Atomics and other missile programs. Again, as we have stated in the past, We are thrilled to be a strategic supplier with GA and reached $1 million in revenue in March this year for the first time. And shipments in 2021 will be able over 4X versus 2020. I also want to mention Raytheon Missile and Defense, and the progress in signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. we've been hard at work with new programs and share shift where we can provide value and I'm happy to report 2021 will be a record year overall with the legacy Raytheon businesses grind from less than 90 million in 2020 to over 125 million in 2021, in increases almost 40%.
Regards to the defense backlog, it remained strong, ending Q1 with a backlog of 516 million. Total backlog for the company was 810 million. And this is a great number based on the environment. The defense business grew year-over-year by 8.8%, bolstered by strong revenues and some key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, UAV and other programs as part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously the strength help offset commercial aerospace order pressure, but we anticipate that to start increasing in the second half of 2021. So the press results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs, as mentioned previously, we have wins now on the TOW missile, which was a share shift from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile to dorsal fin assembly. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be worth of a 110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under 80 million in 2019.
I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward, despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment has been under managed in the past, as I've mentioned, but now its structural applications going full speed ahead, along with a long track record and value off any of our electronic systems business. We see a strong future. One other very important metric is that our defense portfolio currently has 48 programs at the end of Q1, above a million in yearly revenue. Up from 34 in 2017, there were 40% increase. The company's cost actions through Q1 2020 are also paying dividends. You can certainly see the effect of this, our actions in the continued strong, gross profit margins year-over-year, and the solid operating income percentage along with diluted EPS. Team did a great job in 2020 on costs and is now extending into 2021 in Q1. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide strong revenue for the remainder of 2021.
Provide strong revenue for the remainder of 2021. We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead we see more commercial aerospace volume return to the Comet. We have the capacity, a strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single aisle aircraft. We stand ready as well with our strong narrow-body platform positions, which Comet's titanium businesses, a platform and super plastic forming leading the way. As I've mentioned the past, we are the world leader in this area and have strong positions already at Airbus, Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulf Stream, and among other OEMs.
Comet also has recognize as now included in the Boeing Premiere Bitters Program, meaning all of this OEM's criteria. And I also want to send my congratulations to our team supporting Airbus, by reaching 100% on-time delivery performance for 2 years straight in April 2021. That's a real achievement.
As mentioned in our last call, we will returned to growth in 2021 with the first quarter being down year-over-year, but now that is behind us. The other 3 quarters we'll see good momentum versus 2020. And we anticipate overall revenue for the year to come is growing low to mid-single digits.
Comet also has a great mid-term and long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense business and strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, as we have a 2:1 ratio versus double aisle aircraft. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well. Finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of 114.1 million. Once again representing strong growth versus 2020, up 12%. Built revenue on some key defense platforms. I mentioned earlier, we saw our increases in demand on our tow missile, UAV, and other missile programs. First quarter's military and space revenue represented 73% of the Comet's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon and GA. And again, ended the first quarter with a strong back look at 516 million, which is up 8.8% year-over-year, represents almost 64% of the Comet's backlog.
Then our commercial aerospace operation first quarter revenue declined year-over-year to 35.4 million, as expected driven by build rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Comet also has effectively adjusted costs and managed downturn as well-positioned once rates stabilized and increase over the long term.
Comet will begin to recover in this market in the second half of 2021. As mentioned earlier, it has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector, spans at roughly 266 million at the end of the first quarter, for the majority of the clients due to the 737 Max program. We do, however, stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place, to support the bill rate increases in the next few years. And we're anxious to get started.
With that I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, w",991,"Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, we continued to demonstrate our ability to perform well at reduced volume levels, which we have had since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic over one year ago. We're looking forward to leveraging the expected increase in demand for our commercial aircraft components and systems, as well as the strength of our defense business as we return to growth in 2021.
Now turning to our first quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was 157.2 million versus 173.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decline reflects 25.2 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms and a decrease in our industrial business, partially offset by 12.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector.
Comet's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately 810 million. As a reminder, we defined backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm, fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of 33.1 million for the quarter versus 36.8 million in the prior year period. While gross margins were essentially flat year-over-year, 21.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 versus 21.2% last year, the headwind from significantly lower manufacturing volumes was largely offset by improved product mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. SG&A was 22.5 million in the first quarter versus 23.2 million last year, reflecting the company's ongoing cost controls with streamlined operations.
Comet reported operating income for the first quarter of 10.6 million, or 6.8% of revenue compared to 13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, excluding expenses related to the previous reported Guaymas fire, was 11.1 million or 7.1% of revenue with the year-over-year performance, largely reflecting the impact of lower volumes.
Interest expense was 2.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus 4.2 million in the prior year period, as the lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. The debt outstanding rose due to the company's cash draw down of $50 million last year to have on hand as we worked through the impact of the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back 25 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 and another 5 million in Q1, leaving 20 million outstanding.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of 6.7 million or 55 cents per diluted share. Compared to net income of 7.9 million or 67 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses, adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was 58 cents. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 21.1 million or 13.5% of revenue, compared to 23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of 99.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus 98.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a 7.4 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers, somewhat offset by 3.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms along with lower industrial sales.
Electronic systems operating income for the first quarter was 12.5 million or 12.6% of revenue versus 15.1 million or 15.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The lower margin was primarily a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs.
Our structural system segment posted revenue of 58 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus 75.4 million last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects 22.1 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by 4.8 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.
Structural systems operating income for the quarter was 5.1 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to 5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin increase was primarily due to favorable product mix and excluding the Guaymas charges, first quarter adjusted operating margin was 9.7% in 2021. Corporate, general and administrative expense, CG&A expense, for the first quarter of 2021 was 7 million or 4.5% of revenue and 6.9 million or 4% of revenue in 2020. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have 17 million in cash on hand and 80 million available on our revolver, resulting in available liquidity of 97 million. We utilized 23 million of cash from operations this quarter compared to with utilizing 12 million in the prior year period. The first quarter typically results in a cash outflow from operations as we pay annual incentives and invest in working capital to support expected business growth. We expect to return to historical cash flow generation levels as we move through the rest of 2021. Our 12 month debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.4 at the end of the first quarter. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent 4.5 million during the first quarter, reflecting a return to more normal investment levels and aligned with our return to growth in 2021. We anticipate spending between 16 million to 18 million in 2021 to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.
In conclusion, we believe our performance this quarter was solid and stable, reflecting the company's lean operations, diverse customer base and strong military demand. For 2021, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about a return to growth in commercial volumes during the second half, as Steve indicated. We'll discuss these trends further at our upcoming investor day on May 26. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve."

Our defense business continues to be the major contributor as we build out this important segment of the company for scale, which includes having the right product portfolio, strong operating metrics, leveraging our lean, highly focused performance center concept.
This is particularly evident in the continued margin strength for gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, despite the significant year over year headwind. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of over 7%. Quality of earning too was very high, with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 share versus  $0.67 a share for Q1, 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of  $0.58 cents a share versus   $0.67 in 2020. These numbers are reached despite overall revenue down 9% from Q1 last year. It's a job well done. This is also a great story for our investors. As we see a return to revenue growth overall in 2021 with commercial aerospace recovering, solid results in Q1 will benefit the rest of the year. The company's first quarter revenue was lower due to the commercial aerospace markets. However, Ducommun's defense business again showed strengthening of 12% versus prior year. And again was the result of many improvements starting back in 2018.
Though not ever wanting to show a negative growth, the overall revenue numbers are impressive despite the pandemic impact on commercial aerospace in the quarter.  We're looking forward to Q2 and posting year over year growth for the first time in a while.  Ducommun's defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and robust business development. Majority of gains in Q1 include the Raytheon TOW program, radar systems for Northrop Grumman, UAVs at General Atomics and other missile programs. Again, as we have stated in the past, We are thrilled to be a strategic supplier with GA and reached $1 million in revenue in March this year for the first time. And shipments in 2021 will be able over 4X versus 2020. I also want to mention Raytheon Missile and Defense, and the progress in signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. we've been hard at work with new programs and share shift where we can provide value and I'm happy to report 2021 will be a record year overall with the legacy Raytheon businesses growing from less than $90 million in 2020 to over $125 million in 2021, in increases almost 40%.
With regards to the defense backlog, it remained strong, ending Q1 with a backlog of $516 million. Total backlog for the company was $810 million. And this is a great number based on the environment. The defense business grew year over year by 8.8%, bolstered by strong revenues and some key defense platforms, which included the TOW missile, UAV and other programs as part of Ducommun continues to deliver. Obviously the strength help offset commercial aerospace order pressure, but we anticipate that to start increasing in the second half of 2021. So the [ press ] results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs.  As mentioned previously, we have wins now on the TOW missile, which was a share [ shift ] from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile 2 dorsal fin assembly. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be worth of a $110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under $80 million in 2019.
I also want to mention that we are optimistic about defense going forward, despite concerns regarding the budget and change in administration. Ducommun's defense segment has been under managed in the past, as I've mentioned, but now its structural applications going full speed ahead, along with a long track record and value offering of our electronic systems business, we see a strong future. One other very important metric is that our defense portfolio currently has 48 programs at the end of Q1 above $1 million in yearly revenue. Up from 34 in 2017, that was a 40% increase. The company's cost actions through Q1 2020 are also paying dividends. You can certainly see the effect of this, our actions in the continued strong, gross profit margins year over year, and the solid operating income percentage along with diluted EPS. Team did a great job in 2020 on costs and is now extending into 2021 in Q1. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense, the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide strong revenue for the remainder of 2021.
 We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters and years ahead we see more commercial aerospace volume return to Ducommun. We have the capacity, a strong operating team, and are prepared for the rate increases, especially in single aisle aircraft. We stand ready as well with our strong narrow-body platform positions with Ducommun's titanium businesses, a platform and super plastic forming leading the way. As I've mentioned the past, we are the world leader in this area and have strong positions already at Airbus, Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Gulf Stream, and among other OEMs.
Ducommun also has recognize as now included in the Boeing Premiere Bidders Program, meeting all of this OEM's criteria. And I also want to send my congratulations to our team supporting Airbus, by reaching 100% on-time delivery performance for two years straight in April, 2021. That's a real achievement.
As mentioned in our last call, we will return to growth in 2021 with the first quarter being down year over year, but now that is behind us. The other three quarters we'll see good momentum versus 2020. And we anticipate overall revenue for the year at Ducommun growing low to mid single digits.
Ducommun also has a great mid-term and long-term future. This will be accomplished by leveraging our new built out defense business and strong position in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, as we have a 2:1 ratio versus double aisle aircraft. Our engineered products portfolio and recent acquisitions will provide opportunities as well.
Finally, we also remain active in the market for M&A and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results in the future.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products, and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $114.1 million. Once again representing strong growth versus 2020, up 12%. Built revenue on some key defense platforms. I mentioned earlier, we saw our increases in demand on our tow missile, UAV, and other missile programs. First quarter's military and space revenue represented 73% of the Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across our defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon and GA. And again, ended the first quarter with a strong back look of $516 million, which is up 8.8% year over year, represents almost 64% of the Ducommun's backlog.
Then our commercial aerospace operation first quarter revenue declined year over year to $35.4 million, as expected driven by build rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted costs and managed downturn as well-positioned once rates stabilized and increase over the long term.
Ducommun will begin to recover in this market in the second half of 2021. As mentioned earlier, it has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector, stands at roughly $266 million at the end of the first quarter, for the majority of the clients due to the 737 Max program. We do however, stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place, to support the bill rate increases in the next few years. And we're anxious to get started.
With that I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris."

As a reminder, please see the company's 10Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, we",999,"Thank you Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's 10Q and Q1 earnings release for further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, our first quarter results were very solid. During Q1, we continued to demonstrate our ability to perform well at reduced volume levels, which we have had since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic over one year ago. We're looking forward to leveraging the expected increase in demand for our commercial aircraft components and systems, as well as the strength of our defense business as we return to growth in 2021.
Now turning to our first quarter results, let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was 157.2 million versus 173.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. The year over year decline reflects 25.2 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms and a decrease in our industrial business, partially offset by 12.2 million of higher sales within the military and space sector.
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the first quarter was approximately $810 million. As a reminder, we defined backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm, fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of $33.1 million for the quarter versus $36.8 million in the prior year period. While gross margins were essentially flat year over year, 21.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 versus 21.2% last year, the headwind from significantly lower manufacturing volumes was largely offset by improved product mix and lower compensation and benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the first quarter versus $23.2 million last year, reflecting the company's ongoing cost controls with streamlined operations.
Ducommun reported operating income for the first quarter of $10.6 million, or 6.8% of revenue compared to $13.6 million or 7.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, excluding expenses related to the previous reported Guaymas fire, was $11.1 million or 7.1% of revenue with the year over year performance largely reflecting the impact of lower volumes.
Interest expense was 2.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus 4.2 million in the prior year period, as the lower interest rates more than offset the impact from higher debt levels. The debt outstanding rose due to the company's cash draw down of $50 million last year to have on hand as we worked through the impact of the pandemic. Of this amount, we paid back $25 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 and another $5 million in Q1, leaving $20 million outstanding.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $6.7 million or  $0.55 cents per diluted share. Compared to net income of $7.9 million or  $0.67 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses, adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2021 was  $0.58 cents. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $21.1 million or 13.5% of revenue, compared to $23.2 million or 13.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.Now let me turn to our segment results. Our electronic systems segment posted revenue of $99.1 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus $98.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $7.4 million increase in sales with the company's military and space customers, somewhat offset by $3.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms along with lower industrial sales.
Electronic systems operating income for the first quarter was $12.5 million or 12.6% of revenue versus $15.1 million or 15.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The lower margin was primarily a result of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs.
Our structural system segment posted revenue of $58 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus $75.4 million last year. The year over year decrease reflects $22.1 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by $4.8 million of higher revenue within the company's military and space markets.
Structural systems operating income for the quarter was $5.1 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to $5.4 million or 7.2% of revenue last year. The year over year operating margin increase was primarily due to favorable product mix and excluding the Guaymas charges, first quarter adjusted operating margin was 9.7% in 2021. Corporate general and administrative expense.  CG&A expense for the first quarter of 2021 was $7 million or 4.5% of revenue $6.9 million or 4% of revenue in 2020. Turning to liquidity and capital resources, we have $17 million in cash on hand and $80 million available on our revolver, resulting in available liquidity of $97 million. We utilized $23 million of cash from operations this quarter compared to with utilizing $12 million in the prior year period. The first quarter typically results in a cash outflow from operations as we pay annual incentives and invest in working capital to support expected business growth. We expect to return to historical cash flow generation levels as we move through the rest of 2021. Our 12 month debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.4 at the end of the first quarter. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the first quarter, reflecting a return to more normal investment levels and aligned with our return to growth in 2021. We anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in 2021 to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.
In conclusion, we believe our performance this quarter was solid and stable, reflecting the company's lean operations, diverse customer base and strong military demand. For 2021, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about a return to growth in commercial volumes during the second half, as Steve indicated. We'll discuss these trends further at our upcoming investor day on May 26. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve."

Today, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Compan",1497,"Well, thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. Today, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. Team has done an excellent job with safety protocols put in place since March 2020. We continue to work with authorities on best practice throughout our many operations. The total number of cases is roughly 214 since the beginning of the pandemic. And within the company, we had 14 cases in Q2 2021.As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun second quarter results were very strong with the company delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, all organic, for the first time since Q1 2020. The company's defense business continues to be a major success with upward momentum growing again year-over-year and with the main contributor to the quarter. The challenges in the commercial aerospace market were overcome again by the team. So we have seen some good signs, for example, with growth at Spirit Aerosystems in Q2. We're optimistic that we will start seeing meaningful OEM build rate increases starting in 2022. In addition to revenue growth, we posted gross margins of 23%, which is the highest level reached in 10 years of the company, along with adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.6%, which is an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of 9%, which is excellent progress.The quality of earnings was high as well with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.69 a share versus $0.43 a share for Q2 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 a share versus $0.48 in 2020. These numbers reflect the return to revenue growth we anticipated along with strong operating management. This is also a great story for our investors and this quarter was the beginning of a return to revenue growth for the full year of 2021 with the commercial aerospace market signed to recover in the quarters ahead. The company's second quarter revenue was higher with the Ducommun's defense business, as mentioned earlier, leading the way being up 20% versus prior year. Our defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and a robust business development approach. The majority of the gains in Q2 include the radar systems for Northrop Grumman, Raytheon TOW program, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAV to general atomics, Falex and other missile programs.Our approach to the market is innovative products and processes that provide significant value to the customer, along with striving for the highest level of service. The numbers show that we continue to be rewarded for this strategy. I also want to mention as I have in the past, the Raytheon Missile and Defense business and the progress since signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. We've been hard at work in 3 areas: new programs, offloading, and share shift. I'm happy to report that 2021 will be a record year overall with this legacy Raytheon business, growing from less than $90 million in 2020 and to over $115 million in 2021, an increase of more than 25%. What a great story. The defense results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. As previously mentioned, we have wins now in the TOW missile, which was a share shift from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile to dorsal fin assembly, both for Raytheon Missile and Defense. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under $80 million in 2019.Another defense structural highlight in Q2 was that Nobles worldwide has secured significant content to supply integrated ammunition handling systems as part of the Stryker and CWS increased lethality program recently awarded to Oshkosh defense. The total program for 6 years can be worth up to $943 million to Oshkosh and their partners. I am also overall still optimistic about the fence opportunities for Ducommun going forward. Despite concerns regarding the recent budget discussions in Washington and the change in administration. This is again due to our value offering and still a modest revenue base. A good amount of runway is still ahead of us here to come. In regards to defense backlog, it remains strong in ending Q2 with a backlog of $501 million. The commercial aerospace backlog also began to show some signs of recovery, increasing sequentially from $266 million at the end of Q1 million to $276 million at the end of Q2. This is certainly a good sign. The total backlog was $814 million for the company and this is very good. So a very good number based on the environment.Now I want to take a few minutes to discuss my thoughts on the commercial aerospace business. We were notified in May with press release approval in July that Ducommun was recognized as an Airbus, detailed parts partner and award a long-term 5-year contract. The commitment from the current industry leader allows us to provide a titanium work package for key products on the A320 and A330 programs. We were and are thrilled and honored to be awarded for the first time at D2P partner recognition, which is a major accomplishment at Airbus representing preferred supplier status along with a long-term 5-year contract. This is a significant step forward for Ducommun and its industry-leading titanium structural component business. To me, it is the highest level of endorsement. And as I mentioned in the press release, a major milestone in the 172-year history of our company. This contract extends through 2026 and will provide many years of great value to Ducommun and its shareholders.Company's cost actions are also continuing to pay dividends. You can certainly see that even before the pandemic, the company was working on initiatives to offset the 737 MAX, the effectiveness of our operational leadership and actions show the gross profit margins year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with the diluted EPS. I also want to mention our efforts on pricing and this is also having a positive impact on the company's financials. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide good revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters ahead, we'll see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We're also very well positioned with a high narrow-body to wide-body ratio for our business and have the capacity and strong operating team to deliver on the forecasted rate increases.We will return overall revenue growth this year, anticipate Ducommun's total revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus 2020. Future growth will be accomplished by leveraging our newly built-out defense business, strong positions in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, with Airbus being a big part of our future as well as our 3 acquisitions which continue to deliver. We also remain active in the market for M&amp;A for new companies that fit our model and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results.Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $113 million, once again representing strong organic growth versus 2020, up 20%. We drove revenue on some key defense platforms. As mentioned earlier, we saw increased demand for our radar systems, TOW missile, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAVS, Falex and other missile programs. The second quarter's military and space revenue represented more than 70% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon. And again, ended the second quarter with a strong backlog of $501 million, which represents 62% of Ducommun's total backlog.Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.6 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, decline in revenue was not as sharp as in prior quarters. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn and is well-positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun expects a meaningful improvement in this market in the second half of 2021, and as mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace stands at roughly $276 million at the end of the second quarter, slightly increased sequentially, as I mentioned earlier, compared to Q1. We stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place to support the expected bill rate increases in the next few years and we are excited to get started.With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the Company's 10-Q and Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve mentioned, Ducommun's second quarter marked our first quarter",999,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the Company's 10-Q and Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve mentioned, Ducommun's second quarter marked our first quarter of top-line year-over-year growth since the pandemic began early in 2020. This growth all driven organically, combined with our strong margin performance in the second quarter helped deliver outstanding overall performance. We anticipate the favorable year-over-year compares on revenue to continue throughout the remainder of 2021. We see this as we expect measured improvement in the commercial aerospace market, while military demand remains strong.Turning to our second quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $160.2 million versus $147.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. The 8.7% increase year-over-year primarily reflects $18.5 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector, partially offset by $2.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $814 million, slightly higher than that at the end of Q1, reflecting program timing, slowly improving commercial demand and an uptick in industrial orders. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.We posted total gross profit of $36.8 million for the quarter versus $32.7 million in the prior-year period. Gross margin rose 80 basis points to 23.0% from 22.2% in the 2020 second quarter, with the increase primarily reflecting favorable manufacturing volume, along with a strong product mix and cost control efforts. The 23% gross margin was our highest quarterly gross margin performance in more than a decade. For the past few years, we've talked about our margin expansion journey that we are on, the second quarter margin highlights that progress. SG&amp;A was $23.7 million in the second quarter versus $22 million last year with the increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. Ducommun reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.1 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $10 million or 6.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was due to the higher revenue, partially offset by increased SG&amp;A expenses.Excluding restructuring charges and Guaymas-related expenses, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was $13.8 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to $10.7 million or 7.3% of revenue in the comparable period last year. Interest expense was $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $3.7 million in the prior-year period, driven mainly by lower interest rates, along with the impact of a decrease in total debt outstanding. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $8.4 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses in both periods, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.74 versus $0.48 in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $23.4 million or 14.6% of revenue compared to $20.3 million or 13.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $102.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $92 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect an $11.6 million increase in the sales of the Company's military and space customers, along with $2.8 million of higher revenue across commercial aerospace platforms, partially offset by lower industrial sales. Electronic Systems operating income for the second quarter was $14.4 million or 14% of revenue versus $10.4 million or 11.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The higher-margin reflects favorable product mix and higher volumes. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $55.4 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $6.9 million of higher revenue with to come -- within the Company's military and space markets, partially offset by $4.9 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications.Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $5.6 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to $6.2 million or 11.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decrease was largely due to unfavorable product mix. Excluding one-time charges in both periods, second quarter adjusted operating margin was 10.9% in 2021 compared to 12.4% last year. CG&amp;A expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $6.9 million or 4.3% of revenue versus $6.6 million or 4.5% of revenue in 2020.Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $97 million and generated $6 million of cash from operations this quarter compared with $9 million in the prior-year period. We generated $3 million of free cash flow for the quarter compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2020. We expect to return to historical cash flow and free cash flow generation levels as we move through the remainder of 2021. Our leverage ratio was 3.3 at the end of the second quarter. In terms of purchases of property and equipment, we spent $3 million during the second quarter, reflecting a lower investment requirement in the current economic environment. For 2021 in total, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.In conclusion and echoing Steve's comments, we are certainly pleased with our second quarter results and look forward to continued strong performance in the second half of the year and beyond. Through our operational focus and the strength of our defense business, along with the favorable impacts of the trends for commercial aerospace, domestic air travel demand and the 737 MAX production, we look forward to continuing delivering top-line -- continued top-line growth and strong underlying performance heading into and through 2022.I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks.

Today, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Compan",1507,"Well, thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. Today, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. Team has done an excellent job with safety protocols put in place since March 2020. We continue to work with authorities on best practice throughout our many operations. The total number of cases is roughly 214 since the beginning of the pandemic. And within the company, we had 14 cases in Q2 2021.
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun second quarter results were very strong with the company delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, all organic, for the first time since Q1 2020. The company's defense business continues to be a major success with upward momentum growing again year-over-year and with the main contributor to the quarter. The challenges in the commercial aerospace market were overcome again by the team. So we have seen some good signs, for example, with growth at Spirit AeroSystems in Q2. We're optimistic that we will start seeing meaningful OEM build rate increases starting in 2022. In addition to revenue growth, we posted gross margins of 23%, which is the highest level reached in 10 years of the company, along with adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.6%, which is an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of 9%, which is excellent progress.
The quality of earnings was high as well with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.69 a share versus $0.43 a share for Q2 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 a share versus $0.48 in 2020. These numbers reflect the return to revenue growth we anticipated along with strong operating management. This is also a great story for our investors and this quarter was the beginning of a return to revenue growth for the full year of 2021 with the commercial aerospace market signed to recover in the quarters ahead. The company's second quarter revenue was higher with the Ducommun's defense business, as mentioned earlier, leading the way being up 20% versus prior year. Our defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and a robust business development approach. The majority of the gains in Q2 include the radar systems for Northrop Grumman, Raytheon TOW program, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAV to general atomics, Falex and other missile programs.
Our approach to the market is innovative products and processes that provide significant value to the customer, along with striving for the highest level of service. The numbers show that we continue to be rewarded for this strategy. I also want to mention as I have in the past, the Raytheon Missile and Defense business and the progress since signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. We've been hard at work in 3 areas: new programs, offloading, and share shift. I'm happy to report that 2021 will be a record year overall with this legacy Raytheon business, growing from less than $90 million in 2020 and to over $115 million in 2021, an increase of more than 25%. What a great story. The defense results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. As previously mentioned, we have wins now in the TOW missile, which was a share shift from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile to dorsal fin assembly, both for Raytheon Missile and Defense. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under $80 million in 2019.
Another defense structural highlight in Q2 was that Nobles worldwide has secured significant content to supply integrated ammunition handling systems as part of the Stryker and CWS increased lethality program recently awarded to Oshkosh defense. The total program for 6 years can be worth up to $943 million to Oshkosh and their partners. I am also overall still optimistic about the fence opportunities for Ducommun going forward. Despite concerns regarding the recent budget discussions in Washington and the change in administration. This is again due to our value offering and still a modest revenue base. A good amount of runway is still ahead of us here to come. In regards to defense backlog, it remains strong in ending Q2 with a backlog of $501 million. The commercial aerospace backlog also began to show some signs of recovery, increasing sequentially from $266 million at the end of Q1 million to $276 million at the end of Q2. This is certainly a good sign. The total backlog was $814 million for the company and this is very good. So a very good number based on the environment.
Now I want to take a few minutes to discuss my thoughts on the commercial aerospace business. We were notified in May with press release approval in July that Ducommun was recognized as an Airbus, detailed parts partner and award a long-term 5-year contract. The commitment from the current industry leader allows us to provide a titanium work package for key products on the A320 and A330 programs. We were and are thrilled and honored to be awarded for the first time at D2P partner recognition, which is a major accomplishment at Airbus representing preferred supplier status along with a long-term 5-year contract. This is a significant step forward for Ducommun and its industry-leading titanium structural component business. To me, it is the highest level of endorsement. And as I mentioned in the press release, a major milestone in the 172-year history of our company. This contract extends through 2026 and will provide many years of great value to Ducommun and its shareholders.
Company's cost actions are also continuing to pay dividends. You can certainly see that even before the pandemic, the company was working on initiatives to offset the 737 MAX, the effectiveness of our operational leadership and actions show the gross profit margins year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with the diluted EPS. I also want to mention our efforts on pricing and this is also having a positive impact on the company's financials. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide good revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters ahead, we'll see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We're also very well positioned with a high narrow-body to wide-body ratio for our business and have the capacity and strong operating team to deliver on the forecasted rate increases.
We will return overall revenue growth this year, anticipate Ducommun's total revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus 2020. Future growth will be accomplished by leveraging our newly built-out defense business, strong positions in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, with Airbus being a big part of our future as well as our 3 acquisitions which continue to deliver. We also remain active in the market for M&A for new companies that fit our model and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $113 million, once again representing strong organic growth versus 2020, up 20%. We drove revenue on some key defense platforms. As mentioned earlier, we saw increased demand for our radar systems, TOW missile, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAVS, Falex and other missile programs. The second quarter's military and space revenue represented more than 70% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon. And again, ended the second quarter with a strong backlog of $501 million, which represents 62% of Ducommun's total backlog.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.6 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, decline in revenue was not as sharp as in prior quarters. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn and is well-positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun expects a meaningful improvement in this market in the second half of 2021, and as mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace stands at roughly $276 million at the end of the second quarter, slightly increased sequentially, as I mentioned earlier, compared to Q1. We stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place to support the expected bill rate increases in the next few years and we are excited to get started.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

Turning to our second quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $160.2 million versus $147.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. The 8.7% increase year-over-year primarily reflects $18.5 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector, partially offset by $2.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $814 million, slightly higher than that at the end of Q1, reflecting program timing, slowly improving commercial demand and an uptick in industrial orders. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of $36.8 million for the quarter versus $32.7 million in the prior-year period. Gross margin rose 80 basis points to 23.0% from 22.2% in the 2020 second quarter, with the increase primarily reflecting favorable manufacturing volume, along with a strong product mix and cost control efforts. The 23% gross margin was our highest quarterly gross margin performance in more than a decade. For the past few years, we've talked about our margin expansion journey that we are on, the second quarter margin highlights that progress. SG&A was $23.7 million in the second quarter versus $22 million last year with the increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. Ducommun reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.1 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $10 million or 6.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was due to the higher revenue, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.
Excluding restructuring charges and Guaymas-related expenses, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was $13.8 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to $10.7 million or 7.3% of revenue in the comparable period last year. Interest expense was $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $3.7 million in the prior-year period, driven mainly by lower interest rates, along with the impact of a decrease in total debt outstanding. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $8.4 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses in both periods, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.74 versus $0.48 in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $23.4 million or 14.6% of revenue compared to $20.3 million or 13.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $102.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $92 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect an $11.6 million increase in the sales of the Company's military and space customers, along with $2.8 million of higher revenue across commercial aerospace platforms, partially offset by lower industrial sales. Electronic Systems operating income for the second quarter was $14.4 million or 14% of revenue versus $10.4 million or 11.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The higher-margin reflects favorable product mix and higher volumes. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $55.4 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $6.9 million of higher revenue with to come -- within the Company's military and space markets, partially offset by $4.9 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications.
Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $5.6 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to $6.2 million or 11.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decrease was largely due to unfavorable product mix. Excluding one-time charges in both periods, second quarter adjusted operating margin was 10.9% in 2021 compared to 12.4% last year. CG&A expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $6.9 million or 4.3% of revenue versus $6.6 million or 4.5% of revenue in 2020.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $97 million and generated $6 million of cash from operations this quarter compared with $9 million in the prior-year period. We generated $3 million of free cash flow for the quarter compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2020. We expect to return to historical cash flow and free cash flow generation levels as we move through the remainder of 2021. Our leverage ratio was 3.3 at the end of the second quarter. In terms of purchases of property and equipment, we spent $3 million during the second quarter, reflecting a lower investment requirement in the current economic environment. For 2021 in total, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.
In conclusion and echoing Steve's comments, we are certainly pleased with our second quarter results and look forward to continued strong performance in the second half of the year and beyond. Through our operational focus and the strength of our defense business, along with the favorable impacts of the trends for commercial aerospace, domestic air travel demand and the 737 MAX production, we look forward to continuing delivering top-line -- continued top-line growth and strong underlying performance heading into and through 2022.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Today, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. Team has done an excellent job with safety protocols put in place since March 2020. We continue to work with authorities on best practice throughout our many operations. The total number of cases is roughly 214 since the beginning of the pandemic. And within the company, we had 14 cases in Q2 2021.
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun second quarter results were very strong with the company delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, all organic, for the first time since Q1 2020. The company's defense business continues to be a major success with upward momentum growing again year-over-year and with the main contributor to the quarter. The challenges in the commercial aerospace market were overcome again by the team. So we have seen some good signs, for example, with growth at Spirit AeroSystems in Q2. We're optimistic that we will start seeing meaningful OEM build rate increases starting in 2022. In addition to revenue growth, we posted gross margins of 23%, which is the highest level reached in 10 years of the company, along with adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.6%, which is an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of 9%, which is excellent progress.
The quality of earnings was high as well with the company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.69 a share versus $0.43 a share for Q2 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 a share versus $0.48 in 2020. These numbers reflect the return to revenue growth we anticipated along with strong operating management. This is also a great story for our investors and this quarter was the beginning of a return to revenue growth for the full year of 2021 with the commercial aerospace market signed to recover in the quarters ahead. The company's second quarter revenue was higher with the Ducommun's defense business, as mentioned earlier, leading the way being up 20% versus prior year. Our defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and a robust business development approach. The majority of the gains in Q2 include the radar systems for Northrop Grumman, Raytheon TOW program, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAV to general atomics, Falex and other missile programs.
Our approach to the market is innovative products and processes that provide significant value to the customer, along with striving for the highest level of service. The numbers show that we continue to be rewarded for this strategy. I also want to mention as I have in the past, the Raytheon Missile and Defense business and the progress since signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. We've been hard at work in 3 areas: new programs, offloading, and share shift. I'm happy to report that 2021 will be a record year overall with this legacy Raytheon business, growing from less than $90 million in 2020 and to over $115 million in 2021, an increase of more than 25%. What a great story. The defense results also show great opportunities when we leverage our structural product lines with defense OEMs. As previously mentioned, we have wins now in the TOW missile, which was a share shift from another supplier and other new programs such as the Standard Missile to dorsal fin assembly, both for Raytheon Missile and Defense. Along with our acquisitions, this part of the business will be north of $110 million in revenue for 2021, where it was under $80 million in 2019.
Another defense structural highlight in Q2 was that Nobles worldwide has secured significant content to supply integrated ammunition handling systems as part of the Stryker and CWS increased lethality program recently awarded to Oshkosh defense. The total program for 6 years can be worth up to $943 million to Oshkosh and their partners. I am also overall still optimistic about the fence opportunities for Ducommun going forward. Despite concerns regarding the recent budget discussions in Washington and the change in administration. This is again due to our value offering and still a modest revenue base. A good amount of runway is still ahead of us here to come. In regards to defense backlog, it remains strong in ending Q2 with a backlog of $501 million. The commercial aerospace backlog also began to show some signs of recovery, increasing sequentially from $266 million at the end of Q1 million to $276 million at the end of Q2. This is certainly a good sign. The total backlog was $814 million for the company and this is very good. So a very good number based on the environment.
Now I want to take a few minutes to discuss my thoughts on the commercial aerospace business. We were notified in May with press release approval in July that Ducommun was recognized as an Airbus, detailed parts partner and award a long-term 5-year contract. The commitment from the current industry leader allows us to provide a titanium work package for key products on the A320 and A330 programs. We were and are thrilled and honored to be awarded for the first time at D2P partner recognition, which is a major accomplishment at Airbus representing preferred supplier status along with a long-term 5-year contract. This is a significant step forward for Ducommun and its industry-leading titanium structural component business. To me, it is the highest level of endorsement. And as I mentioned in the press release, a major milestone in the 172-year history of our company. This contract extends through 2026 and will provide many years of great value to Ducommun and its shareholders.
Company's cost actions are also continuing to pay dividends. You can certainly see that even before the pandemic, the company was working on initiatives to offset the 737 MAX, the effectiveness of our operational leadership and actions show the gross profit margins year-over-year and a solid operating income percentage along with the diluted EPS. I also want to mention our efforts on pricing and this is also having a positive impact on the company's financials. In regards to the outlook, our significant backlog in defense with the many growth programs mentioned earlier will provide good revenue in 2021. We estimate that revenue will be led by defense, but over the quarters ahead, we'll see more commercial aerospace volume returned to Ducommun. We're also very well positioned with a high narrow-body to wide-body ratio for our business and have the capacity and strong operating team to deliver on the forecasted rate increases.
We will return overall revenue growth this year, anticipate Ducommun's total revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus 2020. Future growth will be accomplished by leveraging our newly built-out defense business, strong positions in commercial aerospace, especially on narrow-body revenues, with Airbus being a big part of our future as well as our 3 acquisitions which continue to deliver. We also remain active in the market for M&A for new companies that fit our model and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $113 million, once again representing strong organic growth versus 2020, up 20%. We drove revenue on some key defense platforms. As mentioned earlier, we saw increased demand for our radar systems, TOW missile, F-18, Apache helicopter, UAVS, Falex and other missile programs. The second quarter's military and space revenue represented more than 70% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also continue to be very well positioned for further growth across defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon. And again, ended the second quarter with a strong backlog of $501 million, which represents 62% of Ducommun's total backlog.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year to $37.6 million, as expected, driven by bill rate declines on a number of commercial aerospace platforms, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, decline in revenue was not as sharp as in prior quarters. Ducommun also has effectively adjusted cost and managed the downturn and is well-positioned once rates stabilize and increase over the long term. Ducommun expects a meaningful improvement in this market in the second half of 2021, and as mentioned earlier, has a very bright future. The backlog within our commercial aerospace stands at roughly $276 million at the end of the second quarter, slightly increased sequentially, as I mentioned earlier, compared to Q1. We stand ready with the team, processes and capital in place to support the expected bill rate increases in the next few years and we are excited to get started.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the Company's 10-Q and Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve mentioned, Ducommun's second quarter marked our first quarter",1007,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the Company's 10-Q and Q2 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve mentioned, Ducommun's second quarter marked our first quarter of top-line year-over-year growth since the pandemic began early in 2020. This growth all driven organically, combined with our strong margin performance in the second quarter helped deliver outstanding overall performance. We anticipate the favorable year-over-year compares on revenue to continue throughout the remainder of 2021. We see this as we expect measured improvement in the commercial aerospace market, while military demand remains strong.
Turning to our second quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $160.2 million versus $147.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. The 8.7% increase year-over-year primarily reflects $18.5 million of higher revenue within the military and space sector, partially offset by $2.1 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the second quarter was approximately $814 million, slightly higher than that at the end of Q1, reflecting program timing, slowly improving commercial demand and an uptick in industrial orders. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of $36.8 million for the quarter versus $32.7 million in the prior-year period. Gross margin rose 80 basis points to 23.0% from 22.2% in the 2020 second quarter, with the increase primarily reflecting favorable manufacturing volume, along with a strong product mix and cost control efforts. The 23% gross margin was our highest quarterly gross margin performance in more than a decade. For the past few years, we've talked about our margin expansion journey that we are on, the second quarter margin highlights that progress. SG&A was $23.7 million in the second quarter versus $22 million last year with the increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. Ducommun reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.1 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $10 million or 6.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was due to the higher revenue, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.
Excluding restructuring charges and Guaymas-related expenses, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was $13.8 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to $10.7 million or 7.3% of revenue in the comparable period last year. Interest expense was $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $3.7 million in the prior-year period, driven mainly by lower interest rates, along with the impact of a decrease in total debt outstanding. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $8.4 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. Excluding one-time expenses in both periods, adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.74 versus $0.48 in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $23.4 million or 14.6% of revenue compared to $20.3 million or 13.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $102.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $92 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect an $11.6 million increase in the sales of the Company's military and space customers, along with $2.8 million of higher revenue across commercial aerospace platforms, partially offset by lower industrial sales. Electronic Systems operating income for the second quarter was $14.4 million or 14% of revenue versus $10.4 million or 11.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The higher-margin reflects favorable product mix and higher volumes. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus $55.4 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $6.9 million of higher revenue with to come -- within the Company's military and space markets, partially offset by $4.9 million of lower sales across our commercial aerospace applications.
Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $5.6 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to $6.2 million or 11.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin decrease was largely due to unfavorable product mix. Excluding one-time charges in both periods, second quarter adjusted operating margin was 10.9% in 2021 compared to 12.4% last year. CG&A expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $6.9 million or 4.3% of revenue versus $6.6 million or 4.5% of revenue in 2020.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $97 million and generated $6 million of cash from operations this quarter compared with $9 million in the prior-year period. We generated $3 million of free cash flow for the quarter compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2020. We expect to return to historical cash flow and free cash flow generation levels as we move through the remainder of 2021. Our leverage ratio was 3.3 at the end of the second quarter. In terms of purchases of property and equipment, we spent $3 million during the second quarter, reflecting a lower investment requirement in the current economic environment. For 2021 in total, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million to support ongoing product development and sustaining capital.
In conclusion and echoing Steve's comments, we are certainly pleased with our second quarter results and look forward to continued strong performance in the second half of the year and beyond. Through our operational focus and the strength of our defense business, along with the favorable impacts of the trends for commercial aerospace, domestic air travel demand and the 737 MAX production, we look forward to continuing delivering top-line -- continued top-line growth and strong underlying performance heading into and through 2022.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Tell you, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company re",1379,"Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. Tell you, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. Company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March of 2020. We continue to follow our best practices, aligning with health authorities throughout our many operations. 
Total number of cases is roughly 279 since the beginning of the pandemic, and within the company, we had 65 cases in Q3 of 2021. I also want to mention the company will be following the OSHA vaccination requirements, and we are currently awaiting those rules from the government. 
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results were strong, the company delivering year-over-year revenue of 9%, all organic. Company's defense business delivered another solid performance and the commercial business showed year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since Q4 2019 in the quarter. 
The commercial aerospace markets are recovering, and we are seeing some bright spots. For example, Spirit Aerosystems was 5% of revenue for the quarter and also going from a position of our 19th largest custom revenue in Q3 of 2020 to the fourth in Q3 of 2021. We are optimistic as well that Ducommun will start seeing meaningful OEM bill rate increases from recent comments from Airbus and Boeing starting in 2022. 
Additional revenue growth, we posted solid gross margins of 21.6% along with adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.6%. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of 9%, which is excellent progress as we continue to build our track record of delivering impressive financial results in any environment. 
The quality of earnings was high as well, company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.78 a share versus $0.54 a share for Q3 2020, a 44% increase, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 a share versus [ $0.69 ] in 2020. [ Both dollars ] reflect the return to revenue growth commitment we had anticipated and communicated mid last year. This is also a great story for our investors as Q3 was also the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth with significant runway ahead. 
The company's third quarter revenue was higher with Ducommun's commercial business showing year-over-year growth for the first time since Q4 2019, up 34%, and continued solid defense business versus prior year. Defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and robust business development. The majority of gains in Q3 include the F-18, F-35, UAVs and General Atomics, which more than doubled, Raytheon to program and other missile programs.
Our approach to the market continues to be innovative products and processes that provide significant value to the defense customer, along with striving for consistent high levels of service. The current numbers and backlog show we continue to be rewarded for this strategy.
I also want to mention as in the past, the Raytheon missile and defense business and the progress since signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. We have been hard at work in 3 areas: new programs, off [indiscernible] and share shift. And I'm happy to report that 2021 will be a record year overall with this legacy Raytheon business growing from less than $90 million in 2020 to over $115 million in 2021, an increase of more than 25% with much more runway ahead. 
Another highlight of this partnership occurred in Q3. As Ducommun won a contract with Raytheon, we'll now be supplying critical circuit card assemblies for the SPY-6 radar program with over $15 million annual run rate. This is a major win for our defense circuit card business on a very prestigious program and a great example of our ability to help defense primes off-load production and drive significant value for them with more opportunities ahead. 
In addition, I continue to be optimistic about defense opportunities for our company despite the overall industry challenges. With examples like the SPY-6 on just mentioned, GA becoming a larger customer, our newly developing Northrop relationship and other revenue opportunities. 
In regards to the defense backlog remains strong and ending Q3 with a backlog of $498 million, the commercial aerospace backlog also showed some signs of recovery, increasing sequentially for the second consecutive quarter from $276 million at the end of Q2 to $286 million at the end of Q3 2021, a very good sign. The total backlog was $836 million for the company, and it's a good number based on the environment. 
The company's cost actions are also continuing to pay dividends. You can certainly see even before the pandemic the company was working on initiatives to offset the 737 MAX. The effectiveness of our operations leadership and actions show in the solid gross profit margins and the very good operating income percentages along with the diluted EPS. I also want to mention our pricing efforts continue and are having a positive impact. 
In regards to the outlook, a significant backlog of defense and more momentum in commercial aerospace provide good revenue in Q4 and again in 2022. We estimate that revenue will remain strong in defense, but over the quarters ahead, we will see more and more commercial aerospace volume return to come. 
I want to make clear to our investors and our analysts, we are very well positioned with our high narrow-body to wide-body ratio for our business and also as important, have the capacity, supply chain and strong operating team to deliver in the forecasted rates ahead. 
We also remain active in the market for M&A, looking for new companies that fit our model and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.6 million, a slight increase versus 2020. The solid showing was from revenue on key defense platforms. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for F-35, F-18, UAVs, tow and other missile programs. Third quarter military space revenue represented 70% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also contend to be very well positioned for further growth, as I mentioned earlier, across defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon. And again, ended third quarter with a strong backlog of $498 million, which represents 60% of our total backlog. 
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue increased year-over-year to $41.2 million, driven mainly by build increases on large aircraft platforms, and we're also seeing some good year-over-year growth of our business jet customers, both Gulfstream and Bombardier. 
Ducommun expects a meaningful improvement in the market overall in 2022 and 2023, and the future, we believe, is very bright. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $286 million at the end of Q3, a slight increase sequentially compared to Q2 2021 and the second consecutive quarter of growth for the company. 
Before having Chris review our financial results, I want to mention that our 3 acquisitions since I joined Ducommun have all been winners for the company, our shareholders, and new acquisitions continue to be a very important component of our vision and strategic plan. Having said that, available capital is a critical catalyst, and therefore, we have undertaken a review of our Southern California industrial legacy real estate portfolio. 
Industrial properties in Southern California, as in Seattle and other areas, are an extremely high demand, and the company recently initiated the marketing of one of our facilities as an expected sale leaseback transaction. We anticipate signing and closing on this transaction in the next few months. This transaction is expected to generate in excess of at least $90 million of after-tax cash that we'll then be able to deploy mainly for strategic acquisitions and debt repayment. We will also continue to evaluate additional sale-leaseback opportunities as we move forward in California and are excited about the opportunity and the value that we create for the company and our shareholders. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our update about the outlook for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Execution during Q3, like much of 2021 has been a journey focusing on areas that we can control. Demonstrating strong performance and minimizing the impact of some of the things we can't control like commercial aerospace recovery pacing along with other pandemic-related complexities make our Q3 performance even more noteworthy. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $163.2 million versus $150.4 million for the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase reflects $10.4 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platforms and $2.6 million of higher sales within the military and space sector. All of this growth was organic. 
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $835.5 million, the highest level since the start of the pandemic, reflecting strength in the military electronics markets as well as growth across our commercial aerospace platforms. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
We posted total gross profit of $35.3 million for the quarter versus $33.5 million in the prior year period, while gross margins were 21.6% and 22.3% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Slight decline in margin year-over-year reflects unfavorable product mix. SG&A was $22 million in the third quarter versus $22.1 million last year, reflecting the company's ongoing cost controls and streamlined operations. 
Ducommun reported operating income for the third quarter of $13.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, excluding restructuring expenses and costs related to the previously reported Guaymas fire was $14.1 million or 8.6% of revenue this quarter compared to $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year. 
Interest expense was $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $3.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower interest rates and a lower outstanding debt balance. The company reported net income for the third quarter of $9.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to net income of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding onetime expenses, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 was $0.83 and $0.69, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $23.9 million or 14.6% of revenue compared to $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $104.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $103.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $1.2 million increase in sales with the customers' military and space customers and a slight $0.2 million uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. 
Electronic Systems operating income for the third quarter was $15.3 million or 14.6% of revenue versus $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue in the prior year period, reflecting the higher revenue and continued strong operational results at our performance centers. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $58.5 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $46.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications and $1.4 million of greater revenue from the company's military-based markets. The year-over-year growth helps demonstrate the underlying commercial aerospace demand recovery from the trough levels in the prior year. 
Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $4.5 million or 7.6% of revenue compared to $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin increase was due to favorable volume and fewer onetime charges. Excluding restructuring expenses and the impact of the Guaymas fire, the segment operating margin was 8.8% in 2021 versus 7.7% last year. 
CG&A expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $6.4 million or 3.9% of revenue versus $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2020. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $99 million and generated $5.5 million of cash from operations this quarter compared to $4.9 million in the prior year period. Q4 is typically our strongest cash flow generation quarter, and we expect that to be the case this year. Our investment in inventory and level loading performance centers continues to be the most significant component of our incremental working capital investment. Our trailing debt-to-EBITDA ratio was [ 3.2 at ] 2.2x at the end of the third quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, we are planning on an opportunistic unlocking of some of the equity we have in our Southern California real estate through a potential sale leaseback of our Gardena facility. Once completed, we expect the result is that we are in an even better position to pursue acquisitions, either with the cash we expect to generate or with the additional debt capacity created from potentially paying down debt. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.4 million during the quarter, reflecting lower investment requirements in the current economic environment. For the full year 2021, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in capital expenditures. 
In conclusion, the third quarter, as expected, once again highlighted the stability and strength of Ducommun's product lines and the efficiency of our performance center, focused factory operations. While military demand remains high, commercial deliveries are picking up, a trend we see continuing and we believe will gather momentum in the quarters to come. We will stay focused on employee safety, growth, solid bottom line results and enhancing shareholder value as we assess the business for further ways to increase returns on capital. The company is in great shape as we look to deliver a strong finish to 2021 and head into 2022.
 I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Tell you, as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company. After which, Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.
Company remains focused, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees. The team has done an excellent job with the safety protocols put in place since March of 2020. We continue to follow our best practices, aligning with health authorities throughout our many operations.
Total number of cases is roughly 279 since the beginning of the pandemic, and within the company, we had 65 cases in Q3 of 2021. I also want to mention the company will be following the OSHA vaccination requirements, and we are currently awaiting those rules from the government.
As mentioned in the press release, Ducommun's third quarter results were strong, the company delivering year-over-year revenue of 9%, all organic. Company's defense business delivered another solid performance and the commercial business showed year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since Q4 2019 in the quarter.
The commercial aerospace markets are recovering, and we are seeing some bright spots. For example, Spirit Aerosystems was 5% of revenue for the quarter and also going from a position of our 19th largest customer by revenue in Q3 of 2020 to the fourth in Q3 of 2021. We are optimistic as well that Ducommun will start seeing meaningful OEM build rate increases from recent comments from Airbus and Boeing starting in 2022.
In addition to revenue growth, we posted solid gross margins of 21.6% along with adjusted EBITDA margins of 14.6%. The team also posted adjusted operating income margins of 9%, which is excellent progress as we continue to build our track record of delivering impressive financial results in any environment.
The quality of earnings was high as well, company reaching GAAP diluted EPS of $0.78 a share versus $0.54 a share for Q3 2020, a 44% increase; and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 a share versus $0.69 in 2020. Those numbers reflect the return to revenue growth commitment we had anticipated and communicated mid last year. This is also a great story for our investors as Q3 was also the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth with significant runway ahead.
The company's third quarter revenue was higher with Ducommun's commercial business showing year-over-year growth for the first time since Q4 2019, up 34%, and continued solid defense business versus prior year. Defense business revenues continue to show excellent progress on shipments and robust business development. The majority of gains in Q3 include the F-18, F-35, UAVs and General Atomics, which more than doubled Raytheon TOW program and other missile programs.
Our approach to the market continues to be innovative products and processes that provide significant value to the defense customer, along with striving for consistent high levels of service. The current numbers and backlog show we continue to be rewarded for this strategy.
I also want to mention, as in the past, the Raytheon missile and defense business and the progress since signing the strategic supplier agreement with them in July of 2019. We have been hard at work in 3 areas: new programs, offload and share shift. And I'm happy to report that 2021 will be a record year overall with this legacy Raytheon business growing from less than $90 million in 2020 to over $115 million in 2021, an increase of more than 25% with much more runway ahead.
Another highlight of this partnership occurred in Q3. As Ducommun won a contract with Raytheon, we'll now be supplying critical circuit card assemblies for the SPY-6 radar program with over $15 million annual run rate. This is a major win for our defense circuit card business on a very prestigious program and a great example of our ability to help defense primes off load production and drive significant value for them with more opportunities ahead.
In addition, I continue to be optimistic about defense opportunities for our company despite the overall industry challenges. With examples like the SPY-6 one just mentioned, GA becoming a larger customer, our newly developing Northrop relationship and other revenue opportunities.
In regards to the defense backlog, remains strong and ending Q3 with a backlog of $498 million. The commercial aerospace backlog also showed some signs of recovery, increasing sequentially for the second consecutive quarter from $276 million at the end of Q2 to $286 million at the end of Q3 2021, a very good sign. The total backlog was $836 million for the company, and it's a good number based on the environment.
The company's cost actions are also continuing to pay dividends. You can certainly see even before the pandemic the company was working on initiatives to offset the 737 MAX. The effectiveness of our operations, leadership and actions show in the solid gross profit margins and the very good operating income percentages along with the diluted EPS. I also want to mention our pricing efforts continue and are having a positive impact.
In regards to the outlook, a significant backlog in defense and more momentum in commercial aerospace provide good revenue in Q4 and again in 2022. We estimate that revenue will remain strong in defense, but over the quarters ahead, we will see more and more commercial aerospace volume returning to Ducommun.
I want to make clear to our investors and our analysts, we are very well positioned with our high narrow-body to wide-body ratio for our business and also as important, have the capacity, supply chain and strong operating team to deliver in the forecasted rates ahead. We also remain active in the market for M&A, looking for new companies that fit our model and believe this will only be an accelerator to higher results.
Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $113.6 million, a slight increase versus 2020. The solid showing was from revenue on key defense platforms. As mentioned earlier, we saw increases in demand for F-35, F-18, UAVs, TOW and other missile programs. Third quarter military space revenue represented 70% of Ducommun's revenue in the period. We also contend to be very well positioned for further growth, as I mentioned earlier, across defense platforms over the next several quarters in all sectors, especially at Raytheon; and again, ended third quarter with a strong backlog of $498 million, which represents 60% of our total backlog.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue increased year-over-year to $41.2 million driven mainly by build rate increases on large aircraft platforms, and we're also seeing some good year-over-year growth of our business jet customers, both Gulfstream and Bombardier.
Ducommun expects a meaningful improvement in the market overall in 2022 and 2023, and the future, we believe, is very bright. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stands at roughly $286 million at the end of Q3, a slight increase sequentially compared to Q2 2021 and the second consecutive quarter of growth for the company.
Before having Chris review our financial results, I want to mention that our 3 acquisitions since I joined Ducommun have all been winners for the company, our shareholders, and new acquisitions continue to be a very important component of our vision and strategic plan. Having said that, available capital is a critical catalyst, and therefore, we have undertaken a review of our Southern California industrial legacy real estate portfolio.
Industrial properties in Southern California, as in Seattle and other areas, are an extremely high demand, and the company recently initiated the marketing of one of our facilities as an expected sale leaseback transaction. We anticipate signing and closing on this transaction in the next few months. This transaction is expected to generate in excess of at least $90 million of after-tax cash that we'll then be able to deploy mainly for strategic acquisitions and debt repayment. We will also continue to evaluate additional sale leaseback opportunities as we move forward in California and are excited about the opportunity and the value that we create for the company and our shareholders.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results and",1040,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's 10-Q and Q3 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call.
As Steve discussed, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our update about the outlook for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Execution during Q3, like much of 2021, has been a journey focusing on areas that we can control. Demonstrating strong performance and minimizing the impact of some of the things we can't control like commercial aerospace recovery pacing along with other pandemic-related complexities make our Q3 performance even more noteworthy.
Now turning to our third quarter results. Let me review some of the highlights. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $163.2 million versus $150.4 million for the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase reflects $10.4 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platforms and $2.6 million of higher sales within the military and space sector. All of this growth was organic.
Ducommun's overall backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $835.5 million, the highest level since the start of the pandemic, reflecting strength in the military electronics markets as well as growth across our commercial aerospace platforms. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm-fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
We posted total gross profit of $35.3 million for the quarter versus $33.5 million in the prior year period, while gross margins were 21.6% and 22.3% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Slight decline in margin year-over-year reflects unfavorable product mix. SG&A was $22 million in the third quarter versus $22.1 million last year, reflecting the company's ongoing cost controls and streamlined operations.
Ducommun reported operating income for the third quarter of $13.4 million or 8.2% of revenue compared to $10.3 million or 6.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income, excluding restructuring expenses and costs related to the previously reported Guaymas fire was $14.1 million or 8.6% of revenue this quarter compared to $12.4 million or 8.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year.
Interest expense was $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $3.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower interest rates and a lower outstanding debt balance. The company reported net income for the third quarter of $9.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to net income of $6.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding onetime expenses, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 was $0.83 and $0.69, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $23.9 million or 14.6% of revenue compared to $21.6 million or 14.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2020, reflecting the items I just discussed.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $104.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $103.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $1.2 million increase in sales with the customers' military and space customers and a slight $0.2 million uptick in revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms. Electronic Systems operating income for the third quarter was $15.3 million or 14.6% of revenue versus $14.9 million or 14.4% of revenue in the prior year period, reflecting the higher revenue and continued strong operational results at our performance centers.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $58.5 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus $46.9 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications and $1.4 million of greater revenue from the company's military and space markets. The year-over-year growth helps demonstrate the underlying commercial aerospace demand recovery from the trough levels in the prior year.
Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $4.5 million or 7.6% of revenue compared to $1.8 million or 3.8% of revenue last year. The year-over-year operating margin increase was due to favorable volume and fewer onetime charges. Excluding restructuring expenses and the impact of the Guaymas fire, the segment operating margin was 8.8% in 2021 versus 7.7% last year.
CG&A expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $6.4 million or 3.9% of revenue versus $6.4 million or 4.2% of revenue in 2020.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We have available liquidity of $99 million and generated $5.5 million of cash from operations this quarter compared to $4.9 million in the prior year period. Q4 is typically our strongest cash flow generation quarter, and we expect that to be the case this year. Our investment in inventory and level loading performance centers continues to be the most significant component of our incremental working capital investment. Our trailing debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2 -- at 2.2x at the end of the third quarter.
As Steve mentioned, we are planning on an opportunistic unlocking of some of the equity we have in our Southern California real estate through a potential sale leaseback of our Gardena facility. Once completed, we expect the result is that we are in an even better position to pursue acquisitions either with the cash we expect to generate or with the additional debt capacity created from potentially paying down debt.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.4 million during the quarter, reflecting lower investment requirements in the current economic environment. For the full year 2021, we anticipate spending between $16 million to $18 million in capital expenditures.
In conclusion, the third quarter, as expected, once again highlighted the stability and strength of Ducommun's product lines and the efficiency of our performance center focused factory operations. While military demand remains high, commercial deliveries are picking up, a trend we see continuing and we believe will gather momentum in the quarters to come. We will stay focused on employee safety, growth, solid bottom line results and enhancing shareholder value as we assess the business for further ways to increase returns on capital. The company is in great shape as we look to deliver a strong finish to 2021 and head into 2022.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

It just gets us better positioned for when the commercial aerospace rates go up meaningfully, we believe, higher in 2022.
We've got our commitments. We certainly have strengthened the company through a difficult period for us and for the entire industry. And that's really due to our effective strategy, our dedicated people and our operational leadership.
In closing, as in the past, I just want to thank and tell all our employees that I'm proud of them and all their efforts with the many challenges of the continued issues on the pandemic and the 737 MAX. All our members show up at our operations every day and though, stressful, they get the job done for our customers, for our nations and allies, and each other.
So with that, I'll turn it over for questions. Thank you."

Second thing is, is that we're going to follow the OSHA requirements.

So that one, we're very, very proud of, I would say.
What I'm seeing, and that's one of the reasons I'm optimistic about our defense business with our -- we're fairly still -- our penetration is fairly still at a light level. I think what I'm hearing, what I'm seeing is that there's more competition. So margins are being pressured, and folks that were more vertically integrated in the past, you just can't do that anymore. They're not -- they're more firm fixed pricing. There's other things that are going on.
