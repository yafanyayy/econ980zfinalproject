Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to start by thanking all 2,700 of my Equity Residential colleagues across the country, for their dedication to serving our 150,000 residents during a very difficult year. Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020, and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021.
Today, I will start with some color on the current state of our business and its future prospects. Then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we'll take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations.
Turning to the business. We are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic and renewed shutdowns in our markets, gives us even more of a cause for optimism.
If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well.
Admittedly, though, pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out.
While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, take some time to fully manage fast itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results. As we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020.
But just as our reported results lagged, our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods. The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021.
While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive.
Turning to the long term. We believe that the fundamental factors that have long made equity residential an attractive place to invest your capital, remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country. Centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences. Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs.
And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen.
Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened.
Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers.
Third, we have a highly-skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring.
In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths.
Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings.
But our portfolio can always be improved, and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. You've seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington, D.C., with strong resident demographics.
We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters.
To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis."

So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business so let me start by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2",2304,"Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business so let me start by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances.
Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.
In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about 1/3 of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets.
While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on.
So first, demand. Demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpaced move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven't seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December's levels, but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell.
Turning to pricing. The chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful.
We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year.
Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight.
Now let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November.
Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation.
At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months.
Boston will have its challenges in '21, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year.
New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020.
Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents' basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don't want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions.
For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy at rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market.
Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district.
The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they've been averaging just below 1 month.
2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021.
Heading West. Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down.
In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets, during the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications.
Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation, and the increase in this quarter's job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product.
The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about 2/3 of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications.
Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company's plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe an in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again.
There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state, and clearly, that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market.
Supply in '21 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay at home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city.
Our focus in San Francisco in '21 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in '21, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020.
Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area despite some pretty difficult pandemic related headlines in the L.A. area. Our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications.
Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire Corridor. West L.A. continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income.
For '21, L.A. should be 1 of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency.
I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021.
In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue. And that through '21, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Garechana."

This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.As part of the release and manageme",1352,"Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.
As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal.
Let's start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required.
In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out.
First, physical occupancy. You heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue. And that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement.
Next, pricing. Much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduce concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear.
The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won't fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results.
And finally, some thoughts on bad debt. As Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions.
In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results.
Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery.
Now some color on same store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I'd like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic.
Now a little color on the major categories. Real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual, will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out.
Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%.
That leaves us with the final 2 categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we're expecting higher natural gas prices, which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020.
Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The backloaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021.
A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent, positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A."

John, so in terms of values, and let's focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there's just been very little -- and you know, there's very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there's one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that's an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate -- excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it's just 1 deal. And I don't have a lot of others.
In San Francisco, there's certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we're probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they'll ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn't make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into '22. And the idea that we'd sell at a big discount doesn't make sense to me, but I think you will see us to be more active sellers in those 2 places.
Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers.
D.C., too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven't seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There's some rules in D.C. that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I'll pause there, and I hope that's responsive."

But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg, as you know. So we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we're buying than the stuff we're selling. But a lot of stuff we're selling is interesting to the buyers because they're levering it up or they've got a renovation play. Or some other way they're juicing their IRR that we either don't believe in or can't underwrite. So I guess that's how I'd answer. It's kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it's 1% better."

The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it's really a marginal shift in this stuff.
So from the demographic side, no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you've got some affordability opportunities right now. So you're seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it's still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%.
So actually, everything we've looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in from an affordability from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us."

When you go specific to New York, we really haven't seen any material change on that front at all. It's actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter.

Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now, and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home. These were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic. I mean we're rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire, so I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, are disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I'm guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the Tri-state area is not actually going to matter very much to us."

I mean, what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team even before the pandemic, and the Board had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan.
We do think there's going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We're either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they're going to need to pay closer at pre-pandemic value because they're almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we're going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit. And then we'll sell a few of those assets later. So it's not that we don't believe in the urban centers, we'll stay overweighted to them, but not this overweighted.
And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That's probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I'm not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we're thinking about developing a couple of deals. They're just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that's sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So we -- you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco. And overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don't have an order of magnitude to give you, but that's a source.
And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area. And to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We're looking at a development deal in the Tri-state area, we've acquired in Jersey City over the last year or 2. So it's not like we're not interested in staying invested in the area. It's just spreading the money out a little bit. So I guess I'd have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets."

I think New York will continue to be a great urban center and San Francisco will eventually recover. But I think places like Denver now have an urban center. It's not as dense as it needs to be, but it's attractive, and we have 3 buildings in Downtown Denver, and those are well occupied. So I guess I'd say, I think the trend towards urbanization, I think, is inexorable over the whole world and in the United States. I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what's going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there's just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown. So I just think some of these other cities are also densifying, but I don't believe that urbanization is going to end in the United States. I think it's just merely been interrupted."

Handell, so I think all 3 of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year, will certainly be in lease-up for some time. We've been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn't seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least 2 deals we like that we would consider starting this deal this year, pardon me. One is in the district of Columbia proper. It's in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So we really like the location. And because of Topa, and I know you've been around a lot, so you know what Topa is, but the quick brief there as it's a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it's being sold in the district of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base. So building like we've done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that deal would likely start this year.
Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal, Handell, is that's a density play. It's us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it's very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it's a place we really like. It's a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We're looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there's a couple of things in Denver, we're thinking about as development opportunities, again. We'd like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we're looking at are either path of growth, I'd say, between urban and suburban or suburban development.
So I'd expect us to start those 2 deals I just mentioned, maybe 1 or 2 other things, we'll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we'll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out."

At this time, I don't expect like the April and May to do anything materially different. I'm optimistic that we're going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you're seeing is really systemic across all the markets. But again, I have the most improvement to gain or the most area to make up in San Francisco and New York.

I think it isn't going to be an accretive one. I think it's going to be about even now. And I think what we're buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That's good.

But the fact that we're seeing -- we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there's certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are being the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn't in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November, were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York.
So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I'd also add, it's the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field, feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they're this well occupied.
When you're on your back heels, it's harder to do. So I would say we're positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter.

And what pressure do we think that, that's going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it's a very granular process.
And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you've got -- you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply.

What we see that's being generated in '21, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets.
Now in Washington, D.C., that number seems completely unaffected. I mean start seeing relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that's an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward."

But I will say that we didn't -- and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt. Is that we didn't take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration's bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last -- yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We're still analyzing all of that. So we're not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that's very helpful.
Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we're thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I've taken your question a little longer, but I think it's important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings."

We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations.
Turning to the business. We are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well.
Admittedly, though, pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out.
While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020.
But just as our reported results lagged our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods. The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021.
While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive.
Turning to the long term. We believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital, remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country. Centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences. Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen.
Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers.
Third, we have a highly-skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths.
Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings.
But our portfolio can always be improved, and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. You've seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington, D.C., with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters.
To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis."
28209,693219789,2205999,"Equity Residential, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through",2301,"Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances.
Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.
In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about 1/3 of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets.
 While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on.
So first, demand. Demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven't seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December's levels, but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell.
Turning to pricing. The chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful.
We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year.
Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight.
Now let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation.
At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in '21, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year.
New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020.
Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents' basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don't want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions.
For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market.
Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they've been averaging just below 1 month. 
2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021.
Heading West. Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down.
In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation, and the increase in this quarter's job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. 
San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about 2/3 of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company's plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again.
There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state, and clearly, that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market.
Supply in '21 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city.
Our focus in San Francisco in '21 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in '21, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020.
Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the L.A. area. Our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West L.A. continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income.
For '21, L.A. should be 1 of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency.
I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021.
In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue. And that through '21, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Garechana."

This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.As part of the release and manageme",1351,"Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.
As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal.
Let's start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out.
First, physical occupancy. You heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue. And that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing. Much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear.
The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won't fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results.
And finally, some thoughts on bad debt. As Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions.
In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery.
Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I'd like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic.
Now a little color on the major categories. Real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out.
Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%.
That leaves us with the final 2 categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we're expecting higher natural gas prices, which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020.
Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The backloaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021.
A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent, positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A."

John, so in terms of values, and let's focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there's just been very little -- and you know, there's very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there's one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that's an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate -- excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it's just 1 deal. And I don't have a lot of others. 
In San Francisco, there's certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we're probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they'll ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably -- our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn't make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into '22. And the idea that we'd sell at a big discount doesn't make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those 2 places. 
Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. 
D.C., too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven't seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There's some rules in D.C. that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I'll pause there, and I hope that's responsive?"

I -- again, we've seen deals we've underwritten, for example, in Denver lately that are 7 unlevered IRR deals. Maybe even some high 6s. A lot of stuff we're selling might be 1% lower than that. But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg, as you know. So we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we're buying than the stuff we're selling. But a lot of stuff we're selling is interesting to the buyers because they're levering it up or they've got a renovation play or some other way they're juicing their IRR that we either don't believe in or can't underwrite. So I guess that's how I'd answer. It's kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it's 1% better."

The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it's really a marginal shift in this stuff. 
So from the demographic side, no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you've got some affordability opportunities right now. So you're seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it's still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we've looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us."

So for the portfolio, we're expecting to be up at 54%. 
New York is still 1 of those markets, that we're off -- we're off what is normal for that market. So we're still sitting below 50%, and we should be up above 60%.

Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now, and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home. These were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic. I mean we're rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I'm guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the tri-state area is not actually going to matter very much to us."

So I wouldn't expect that, Amanda, to change very much just because again, our portfolio is more suited to couples and a few roommate situations and some families, certainly, but it's just -- it is like we added 3 bedroom units to the portfolio to make it more family-friendly in the last couple of quarters."

I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. 
We do think there's going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We're either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they're going to need to pay close to -- close or at pre-pandemic value because they're almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we're going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit. And then we'll sell a few of those assets later. So it's not that we don't believe in the urban centers, we'll stay overweighted to them, but not this overweighted. 
And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That's probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I'm not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we're thinking about developing a couple of deals. They're just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that's sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So we -- you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco. And overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don't have an order of magnitude to give you, but that's a source. 
And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area. And to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We're looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we've acquired in Jersey City over the last year or 2. So it's not like we're not interested in staying invested in the area. It's just spreading the money out a little bit. So I guess I'd have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets."

So I guess I'd say, I think the trend towards urbanization, I think, is inexorable over the whole world and in the United States. I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what's going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there's just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown. So I just think some of these other cities are also densifying, but I don't believe that urbanization is going to end in the United States. I think it's just merely been interrupted."

So I think all 3 of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. Will certainly be in lease-up for some time. We've been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn't seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least 2 deals we like that we would consider starting this deal -- this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It's in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you've been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it's a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it's being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base. So building like we've done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. 
Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and -- is that's a density play. It's us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it's very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it's a place we really like. It's a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We're looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there's a couple of things in Denver, we're thinking about as development opportunities, again. We'd like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we're looking at are either path of growth, I'd say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. 
So I'd expect us to start those 2 deals I just mentioned, maybe 1 or 2 other things, we'll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we'll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out."

At this time, I don't expect like the April and Mays to do anything materially different. I'm optimistic that we're going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you're seeing is really systemic across all the markets. But again, I have the most improvement to gain or the most area to make up in San Francisco and New York.

I think it isn't going to be an accretive one. I think it's going to be about even now. And I think what we're buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That's good. And I think what we'll have then is just more opportunities to invest and develop across a larger number of markets and the steadier platform win inevitable issues come up in the future.

But the fact that we're seeing -- we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there's certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn't in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York.
So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I'd also add, it's the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they're this well occupied.
When you're on your back heels, it's harder to do. So I would say we're positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter.

So I'll just start at the top and just say, so right now, when you think about the natural shifts that happened between the fourth quarter into the first quarter. When we look at supply for '20 and '21, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it's really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront.
So when we think about supply, we're looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we're looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that's going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it's a very granular process.
And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you've got -- you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply.
From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past."

If I can just add something on some sort of new research we've done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at -- just -- it's tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we're trying to determine what does it look like in '23. And a couple of our guys, it's really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that's very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what's relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in '20 and '21. What we see that's being generated in '21, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets.
Now in Washington, D.C., that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that's an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward."

But I will say that we didn't -- and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn't take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration's bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last -- yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We're still analyzing all of that. So we're not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that's very helpful.
Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we're thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I've taken your question a little longer, but I think it's important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings."

Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020, and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021.
Today, I will start with some color on the current state of our business and its future prospects. Then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we'll take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations.
Turning to the business. We are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well.
Admittedly, though, pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out.
While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020.
But just as our reported results lagged our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods. The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021.
While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive.
Turning to the long term. We believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital, remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country. Centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences. Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen.
Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers.
Third, we have a highly-skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths.
Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings.
But our portfolio can always be improved, and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. You've seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington, D.C., with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters.
To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis."
28209,693219789,2256664,"Equity Residential, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through",2301,"Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances.
Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.
In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about 1/3 of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets.
 While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on.
So first, demand. Demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven't seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December's levels, but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell.
Turning to pricing. The chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful.
We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year.
Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight.
Now let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation.
At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in '21, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year.
New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020.
Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents' basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don't want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions.
For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market.
Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they've been averaging just below 1 month. 
2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021.
Heading West. Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down.
In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation, and the increase in this quarter's job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. 
San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about 2/3 of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company's plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again.
There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state, and clearly, that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market.
Supply in '21 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city.
Our focus in San Francisco in '21 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in '21, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020.
Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the L.A. area. Our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West L.A. continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income.
For '21, L.A. should be 1 of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency.
I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021.
In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue. And that through '21, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Garechana."

This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.
As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal.
Let's start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out.
First, physical occupancy. You heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue. And that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing. Much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear.
The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won't fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results.
And finally, some thoughts on bad debt. As Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions.
In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery.
Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I'd like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic.
Now a little color on the major categories. Real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out.
Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%.
That leaves us with the final 2 categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we're expecting higher natural gas prices, which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020.
Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The backloaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021.
A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent, positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A."

John, so in terms of values, and let's focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there's just been very little -- and you know, there's very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there's one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that's an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate -- excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it's just 1 deal. And I don't have a lot of others. 
In San Francisco, there's certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we're probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they'll ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably -- our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn't make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into '22. And the idea that we'd sell at a big discount doesn't make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those 2 places. 
Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. 
D.C., too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven't seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There's some rules in D.C. that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I'll pause there, and I hope that's responsive?"

But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg, as you know. So we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we're buying than the stuff we're selling. But a lot of stuff we're selling is interesting to the buyers because they're levering it up or they've got a renovation play or some other way they're juicing their IRR that we either don't believe in or can't underwrite. So I guess that's how I'd answer. It's kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it's 1% better."

The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it's really a marginal shift in this stuff. 
So from the demographic side, no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you've got some affordability opportunities right now. So you're seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it's still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we've looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us."

I mean we're rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I'm guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the tri-state area is not actually going to matter very much to us."

I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. 
We do think there's going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We're either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they're going to need to pay close to -- close or at pre-pandemic value because they're almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we're going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit. And then we'll sell a few of those assets later. So it's not that we don't believe in the urban centers, we'll stay overweighted to them, but not this overweighted. 
And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That's probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I'm not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we're thinking about developing a couple of deals. They're just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that's sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So we -- you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco. And overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don't have an order of magnitude to give you, but that's a source. 
And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area. And to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We're looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we've acquired in Jersey City over the last year or 2. So it's not like we're not interested in staying invested in the area. It's just spreading the money out a little bit. So I guess I'd have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets."

I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what's going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there's just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown.

So I think all 3 of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. Will certainly be in lease-up for some time. We've been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn't seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least 2 deals we like that we would consider starting this deal -- this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It's in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you've been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it's a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it's being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base. So building like we've done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. 
Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and -- is that's a density play. It's us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it's very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it's a place we really like. It's a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We're looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there's a couple of things in Denver, we're thinking about as development opportunities, again. We'd like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we're looking at are either path of growth, I'd say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. 
So I'd expect us to start those 2 deals I just mentioned, maybe 1 or 2 other things, we'll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we'll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out."

I'm optimistic that we're going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you're seeing is really systemic across all the markets.

Or is it more of your view about just people returning to cities and that could create leasing demand?"

I'm going to start, and I think Michael is going to supplement. But the fact that we're seeing -- we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there's certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn't in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York.
So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I'd also add, it's the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they're this well occupied.
When you're on your back heels, it's harder to do. So I would say we're positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter.
I don't know, Michael, if you have something you'd add?"

The actual, the velocity and the strength of the leasing season that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 has actually shifted this profile a little bit, and put us now for 35% of our leases expiring in the third quarter of 21% and 22% in the fourth quarter. So I actually view this as a little bit of a positive that we shifted some of these expirations to be back-half loaded, which gives us more time to even recover some of this rate and then get through those leases."

We actually flip to kind of the loss to lease model back in that fourth quarter.

So I'll just start at the top and just say, so right now, when you think about the natural shifts that happened between the fourth quarter into the first quarter. When we look at supply for '20 and '21, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it's really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront.
So when we think about supply, we're looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we're looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that's going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it's a very granular process.
And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you've got -- you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply.
From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past."

If I can just add something on some sort of new research we've done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at -- just -- it's tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we're trying to determine what does it look like in '23. And a couple of our guys, it's really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that's very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what's relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in '20 and '21. What we see that's being generated in '21, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets.
Now in Washington, D.C., that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that's an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward."

But I will say that we didn't -- and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn't take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration's bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last -- yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We're still analyzing all of that. So we're not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that's very helpful.
Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we're thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I've taken your question a little longer, but I think it's important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings."

Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020, and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021.

Then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we'll take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations.
Turning to the business. We are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well.
Admittedly, though, pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out.
While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020.
But just as our reported results lagged our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods. The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021.
While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive.
Turning to the long term. We believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital, remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country. Centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences. Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen.
Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers.
Third, we have a highly-skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths.
Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings.
But our portfolio can always be improved, and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. You've seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington, D.C., with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters.
To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis."

So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through",2301,"Thanks, Mark. So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances.
Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.
In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about 1/3 of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets.
 While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on.
So first, demand. Demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven't seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December's levels, but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell.
Turning to pricing. The chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful.
We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year.
Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight.
Now let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation.
At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in '21, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year.
New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020.
Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents' basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don't want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions.
For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market.
Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they've been averaging just below 1 month. 
2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021.
Heading West. Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down.
In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation, and the increase in this quarter's job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. 
San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about 2/3 of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company's plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again.
There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state, and clearly, that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market.
Supply in '21 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city.
Our focus in San Francisco in '21 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in '21, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020.
Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the L.A. area. Our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West L.A. continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income.
For '21, L.A. should be 1 of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency.
I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021.
In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue. And that through '21, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Garechana."

This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.As part of the release and manageme",1351,"Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A.
As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal.
Let's start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out.
First, physical occupancy. You heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue. And that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing. Much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear.
The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won't fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results.
And finally, some thoughts on bad debt. As Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions.
In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery.
Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I'd like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic.
Now a little color on the major categories. Real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out.
Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%.
That leaves us with the final 2 categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we're expecting higher natural gas prices, which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020.
Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include: a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The backloaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021.
A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent, positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A."

John, so in terms of values, and let's focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there's just been very little -- and you know, there's very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there's one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that's an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate -- excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it's just 1 deal. And I don't have a lot of others. 
In San Francisco, there's certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we're probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they'll ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably -- our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn't make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into '22. And the idea that we'd sell at a big discount doesn't make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those 2 places. 
Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. 
D.C., too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven't seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There's some rules in D.C. that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I'll pause there, and I hope that's responsive?"

But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg, as you know. So we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we're buying than the stuff we're selling. But a lot of stuff we're selling is interesting to the buyers because they're levering it up or they've got a renovation play or some other way they're juicing their IRR that we either don't believe in or can't underwrite. So I guess that's how I'd answer. It's kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it's 1% better."

The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it's really a marginal shift in this stuff. 
So from the demographic side, no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you've got some affordability opportunities right now. So you're seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it's still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we've looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us."

I'll just start off and say, just overall, when we've looked at the percent of residents moving to buy homes, again, this is one of those sets, we really have not seen a difference.

It's actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think relative to our assumptions as we move forward, I think you heard in my prepared remarks, we're starting to see some improvement in the percent of residents renewing. So for the portfolio, we're expecting to be up at 54%. 
New York is still 1 of those markets, that we're off -- we're off what is normal for that market. So we're still sitting below 50%, and we should be up above 60%. And so I think our modeling and our assumptions going forward is that we start to see a little bit of improvement in our ability to retain those residents.

And as far as we can tell, that continues to be the case historically. Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now, and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home. These were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic. I mean we're rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I'm guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the tri-state area is not actually going to matter very much to us."

I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. 
We do think there's going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We're either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they're going to need to pay close to -- close or at pre-pandemic value because they're almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we're going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit. And then we'll sell a few of those assets later. So it's not that we don't believe in the urban centers, we'll stay overweighted to them, but not this overweighted. 
And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That's probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I'm not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we're thinking about developing a couple of deals. They're just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that's sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So we -- you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco. And overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don't have an order of magnitude to give you, but that's a source. 
And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area. And to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We're looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we've acquired in Jersey City over the last year or 2. So it's not like we're not interested in staying invested in the area. It's just spreading the money out a little bit. So I guess I'd have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets."

I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what's going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there's just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown.

So I think all 3 of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. Will certainly be in lease-up for some time. We've been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn't seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least 2 deals we like that we would consider starting this deal -- this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It's in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you've been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it's a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it's being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base. So building like we've done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. 
Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and -- is that's a density play. It's us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it's very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it's a place we really like. It's a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We're looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there's a couple of things in Denver, we're thinking about as development opportunities, again. We'd like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we're looking at are either path of growth, I'd say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. 
So I'd expect us to start those 2 deals I just mentioned, maybe 1 or 2 other things, we'll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we'll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out."

And I think at this point, it's too early to understand May, June and July kind of timeframes."

As you guys look back over the history of the company, though, EQR has morphed from the El Paso or the sort of Midwest low-rise to sort of urban culminating with Archstone and now you're sort of going back.
But in that process, there was dilution and that investors took as far as earnings. As you envision the next markets that you're going to enter and the transitioning to decrease your exposure in some of the majors like New York or San Francisco, do you envision like that same sort of dilution? Or the way you guys see it, you can see it sort of in a modest pace that earnings can still grow, and so that we don't go through that same dilution that we experienced previously."

Now I think those 2 cap rates are close to each other. Part of that is a product of what's going on in New York and San Francisco. But I don't envision this to be a dilutive exercise. I think it isn't going to be an accretive one. I think it's going to be about even now. And I think what we're buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That's good. And I think what we'll have then is just more opportunities to invest and develop across a larger number of markets and the steadier platform win inevitable issues come up in the future.
So I don't expect dilution from the process. Again, I would have told you in early '19, I was hoping there'd be accretion in the process, but I don't think that's realistic right now."

So I'm just kind of wondering what we should really be taking out of this about your confidence level of getting some improvement in these 2 quarters, which are, again, not really where you make your year, which is second quarter, third quarter in terms of occupancy and rent? What is really giving you guys confidence about your ability to do better in the spring? Is it actually something you're seeing in the data right now?

I'm going to start, and I think Michael is going to supplement. But the fact that we're seeing -- we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there's certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn't in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York.
So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I'd also add, it's the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they're this well occupied.
When you're on your back heels, it's harder to do. So I would say we're positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter.

So I actually view this as a little bit of a positive that we shifted some of these expirations to be back-half loaded, which gives us more time to even recover some of this rate and then get through those leases."

When we look at supply for '20 and '21, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it's really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront.
So when we think about supply, we're looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we're looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that's going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it's a very granular process.
And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you've got -- you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply.
From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past."

If I can just add something on some sort of new research we've done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at -- just -- it's tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we're trying to determine what does it look like in '23. And a couple of our guys, it's really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that's very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what's relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in '20 and '21. What we see that's being generated in '21, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets.
Now in Washington, D.C., that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that's an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward."

But I will say that we didn't -- and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn't take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration's bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last -- yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We're still analyzing all of that. So we're not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that's very helpful.
Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we're thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I've taken your question a little longer, but I think it's important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings."

We are pleased to report that we are seeing significant improvement in our operations, driven by continued strong demand all across our portfolio. This, in turn, allowed us to extend the gains in occupancy we discussed on the prior earnings call. 
We are currently 96% occupied, 160 basis point improvement since December 31, 2020. We are especially encouraged by our numbers as we enter our primary leasing season, the period of peak demand in our business and by the continuing reopening activities in our cities. The improving pricing we noted on last quarter's call has accelerated over the past few months. Pricing trend, which is a leading indicator of where market rents are going and is computed net of concessions, is up 14% this year, and we have already recovered 60% of the pricing reduction we suffered as a result of the pandemic. 
In fact, on a pricing trend basis, collective pricing in our markets outside of New York and San Francisco is likely to recover completely by the end of May. The New York and San Francisco markets declined by more than our other markets, so they have further to go to regain pre-pandemic pricing, but momentum is strong in those 2 markets, and they are making good progress towards full recovery. 
To provide additional color on our operating trends, we posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. 
After I give a quick overview of guidance changes and investment activities, Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide more detail on our current performance and forward trajectory. 
After that, we'll take your questions. 
The encouraging trends, I just mentioned, led us to raise our guidance ranges for physical occupancy, same-store revenue, same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations as disclosed in last night's release. 
The midpoint of our same-store revenue range was raised 100 basis points to negative 7%, the midpoint of our NOI range was raised 150 basis points to negative 12% and the midpoint [indiscernible] stronger and earlier than anticipated recovery trends in both our residential and nonresidential operations across all our markets. 
We are well positioned heading into our prime leasing season, but our reported same-store revenue numbers will lag the recovery in our operating statistics as we work through the impact of lower rents and of concessions. 
In terms of the first quarter's numbers, the impact of the pandemic is readily apparent. We said previously that our reported same-store revenue numbers would get worse before they get better, and that's exactly what happened. Same-store revenues declined 10.5% for the quarter, which, while it was a bit better than we expected, is still among the worst revenue numbers in our history. 
We believe that our first quarter results will be our low point for the year and that they will improve from this point on. 
Turning to investments. While no dispositions or acquisitions closed this quarter, we have been active in the transaction market, and we expect to have a considerable amount of activity to report on next quarter. 
As we've said on prior calls, in order to create the most stable, growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are broadening our portfolio over time to increase our exposure to suburban properties in our existing markets, where the resident demographic is similar to our existing affluent urban resident population. 
We are also working on increasing our investment in Denver and continuing to consider a select number of new markets, that have large and growing affluent resident bases, favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and lower political risk. 
While asset prices are high in the locations in which we seek to invest, our funding source for these acquisitions comes from sales of existing properties, especially in California, where we are obtaining pricing that exceeds our pre-pandemic valuations. 
We expect to complete this transaction activity with minimal dilution and to stay consistent with our strategy of acquiring newer assets with modest capital expenditure burdens. 
The 1 piece of notable investment activity that did occur in the quarter was our $5 million investment and a fund that preserves affordable housing across our country. 
This [ fore profit ] fund is run by long time experts in the affordable housing preservation and finance area. Using our equity capital and that of other investors as well as government financing, the fund acquires and improves the quality of existing affordable housing communities that would otherwise be at risk of either physical neglect or where the affordable restrictions are about to expire. 
We have been clear on prior calls of our steadfast opposition to rent control and other short sighted policies that do not help solve the affordable housing shortage. Economists consistently say that rent control, in fact, leads to disinvestment in existing housing and impedes the creation of new housing. 
We support solution-focused investment like this fund that preserve or create affordable housing and favor the elimination of overly restrictive zoning codes that limit housing production where it's needed most. 
Along with ongoing engagement with public officials in our markets, this investment demonstrates our commitment to being part of the solution with respect to the affordable housing gap. 
To sum up, we are encouraged by the progress being made on vaccinations as well as the reopening of cities. Recent announcements made by employers, particularly in the tech industry regarding return to office are welcome news. We believe that the new operating model for most companies will be a hybrid of in-office and work from home and that our portfolio will benefit from workers looking to live close to the office. 
The unique cultural and entertainment options that are becoming available again, as cities reopen, are also magnets to our affluent renter demographic, and we'll draw them back to the cities and to the lifestyle, many of them crave. 
Our customer base has stayed well employed during the pandemic and can afford our current rents and absorb future rent increases as market conditions improve. 
2021 is indeed turning out to be a year of recovery for our company. As we have said before, equity residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions has typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. 
All of this is, of course, premised on continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other economic conditions remain supportive. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support during these challenging times. We are well positioned to benefit from a return to normal as the pandemic subsides. We are optimistic about the future of our business and believe that our portfolio will thrive.

They're excited about reopening of these experiences and feel a sense of urgency to return, especially knowing that these lower rents won't last for long. 
As you may remember from prior calls, we have focused our approach on maximizing revenues by balancing occupancy with rate and concessions, which has proved successful thus far. Our confidence in the recoveries of our cities, coupled with this disciplined approach, kept us from overreacting in 1 direction or the other and we are well positioned as the recovery takes off to sell our excess inventory at net effective rates that are currently 14% higher than the end of last year. 
In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. 
So first, demand. Demand was strong through both the winter season and early spring with a continued trend of increased applications and move-in activity that is well above seasonal norms and has fueled a stronger-than-expected occupancy recovery. 
Occupancy is currently 96%. And as of 2 weeks ago, is now above the prior year comp period. And for the first time, beginning to approach 2019 levels. This occupancy strength is contributing to the improvement in our revenue growth recovery. 
Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions and is a good indicator of where market rents are headed, has improved across all markets during the first quarter and through April. We continue to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. 
In January, concessions averaged just under 6 weeks on about 1/3 of our applications. By March and into April, this has been reduced to about 20% of applications receiving on average 4 weeks, and we expect this to continue to decline into May. As stated in the management presentation, we have seen a 14% improvement in pricing trend from December 31 to April 23. Renewal rate negotiation pressure continues as we renew residents who signed leases at the onset of the pandemic before the declines and pricing trends occurred. 
Outside of Southern California and Denver, our other markets have pricing trend below prior year, which put pressure on renewal negotiations. This situation is improving weekly. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the other markets, excluding New York and San Francisco, to be positive by the end of May. April renewal rate achieved should be 200 basis points better than March, which was a negative 4.5%. The percent of residents renewing also continues to improve, with March and April, both achieving above 55%. These levels remain below our historical average for this time of year, but the gap is closing. 
Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved continue to improve with sequential improvement in new lease change expected for the next several quarters. 
As previously discussed, renewal rate achieved was pressured in Q1, but the pressure will continue to moderate as pricing trend improves and as the rate on expiring leases which were written pre and early onset in the pandemic narrows with current market rents. 
On Pages 6 through 8 of our management presentation, we have provided color on pricing trends, physical occupancy, percent of residents renewing and leasing concessions for each market. 
So I will not repeat that here. But let me provide some brief market-specific commentary. I will start in Boston, where we are seeing an uptick in interest from students as many colleges have announced plans for campuses to open again in the fall. 
We may well benefit from limits on dorm occupancies as some students will need to find alternative housing. This market will face some headwinds from new supply, particularly in the city, where we are still dealing with some non-stabilized lease-ups from last year as well as a few new deals expected to deliver in the back half of 2021. 
New York is starting to see positive momentum. Demand is good, driven by both bargain hunters looking to upgrade and people returning to Manhattan in anticipation of Office reopenings. 
Specifics around office reopenings remain unclear, but indications are that it will be a hybrid that has employees back in the office, at least part of the week by summer and early fall. 
In New York, concessions remain part of the marketing strategy, even while we are raising rates. This market held on to widespread concession use through most of the first quarter, but the latter weeks has shown concession use starting to decline. 
Unlike any of our other markets, New York has a more significant number of local operators not on yield management, who tend to use concessions more frequently. New supply is basically nonexistent in Manhattan, however, supply pressure on the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey in the back half of this year may impact that submarket. Our migration data suggests that this market is beginning to return to normal as applications from outside the New York MSA and move-outs leaving the MSA, both continue to trend closer to normal pre-pandemic levels. 
Turning to D.C. During the pandemic, physical occupancy held up better in D.C. than any of our other East Coast markets. Absorption of new supply also has generally remained healthy that has slowed compared to 2019 levels. 
While demand in this market remains robust, we are facing some headwinds from new supply in 2021. D.C. has an excellent track record of absorbing new supply, but with more than 12,000 units being delivered this year, that track record will be challenged. 
Heading to the West Coast. Seattle trends are moving in the right direction, but the market has shown periods of price resistance. Tech companies continue to hire and are moving towards reopening offices. Amazon's recent announcement of its commitment to an office centric culture as their baseline is a very good sign for driving demand. The expiration of the H1B visa band at the end of March should also be a good driver rebound in 2021 with the largest concentration in the CBD belt on submarket. 
San Francisco to recovery. Concession use in this market has shown a meaningful decline. Our communities located in the city of San Francisco are starting to feel vibrant again. Late in the first quarter, we saw a flurry of announcements from Bay Area tech firms with regards to return to office. 
Many of the tech firms, including Google, are taking a firmer than expected stance with regards to office attendance, as they recognize the importance of in-person work in both product creation and company culture. Schools are reopening with colleges planning for students to return to campus in the fall, and demand for our 2 and 3 bedrooms has clearly increased in the last several weeks. 
New supply will be elevated in 2021 with a large concentration in the South Bay, which may create some pricing headwinds for us. Southern California has been the strongest part of our portfolio during the pandemic. 
Los Angeles, despite being 1 of the most lockdown cities in the country, continues to have good demand. The city is opening back up, and the governor has set mid-June for a full reopening. The most encouraging sign in this market is the pickup in activity in the content creation sector. 
Television and movies that we're filming in other states during the pandemic are returning to LA. [ 2021 ] new supply deliveries will be well spread out across the submarkets to Koreatown submarket. Orange County and San Diego continue to be the real standouts in terms of performance. These markets have the highest occupancies and the best, albeit still negative, revenue performance. But we see same-store revenue growth in these markets turning positive in the second quarter. 
These markets should continue to benefit as the state opens back up, and travel and leisure activity picks up. New supply will be at normal levels and generally well spread out across the submarkets. 
While Southern California is generally 1 of our better performing areas, it has and continues to experience the highest levels of delinquency. We have mobilized our teams to assist our residents in applying for available federal rental assistance dollars, while California was ahead of most states in creating a rental assistant application process. The state is just beginning to process applications and to send out money. We will be aggressive in pursuing these California relief funds as well as other programs throughout the country. 
Finally, in Denver, demand remained strong across the market, although pricing pressure and widespread concession use is common downtown. Our 2 suburban Denver properties have little concession use and are seeing good demand and revenue growth. 
New supply will be elevated from 2020 levels, but good job growth should be a driver of the absorption of that supply. 
Across all of our markets, our focus will remain on increasing rates and continuing to reduce and eliminate concessions, our strategy of not chasing occupancy at any cost during the winter is paying off. 
So far, we have been able to grow our occupancy, while at the same time, recovering just over 60% of the decline in rate that we experienced from March to December of 2020. We believe that this approach will continue to benefit us as we move forward. I'll close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. I am confident that we have the best team in the industry, and they are demonstrating the power of working together as they lead the markets through the recovery phase and remain relentless in serving our customers and taking care of each other. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

So I think there's probably about a month or 2 lag that you start to see as we'll start to cross over. Now remember, the comp period from last year gets easier as we work our way through May and June. So our focus is really around that pre-pandemic period, which is what were rents like in each 1 of these assets at the very beginning of March 2020, and where we have good acceleration, we're focused on what was that high mark from '19 and how fast can we go after that. So I think as we keep pushing forward and keep getting that momentum over prior year, you'll start to see that blended rate improvement really kick into gear. You could see what happened just sequentially from March to April. I would expect you're going to see that same kind of real big pop as you work your way, April into May."

So I'm going to look at cap rates, talk a little bit about cap rates with you, though we all know that's only part of the picture. A lot of these markets, almost all of them that were either in or interested in with the exception of Manhattan, Brooklyn and call it, the city of San Francisco are trading at or higher than they did at the pandemic period. 
So mean we're looking at cap rates, for example, in Denver, 3.75% to 4.25%. 
I mean there isn't a market that's screening cheap. And in terms of expensive, I'd say the recovery is well-priced in. It's probably a charitable way to say it. I think these cap rates are low because people have confidence because even in the Sunbelt markets or places like Denver, there were declines in revenue. And I think what people are seeing is you're going to make that up, and you're going to make that up pretty quickly. And so they're willing to kind of capitalize that into the price. So with the NOI is still relatively low, that makes the cap rates low. So I guess I'd say there aren't any bargains we see. But what works for us is if we can sell some of these assets that whether it's locational or we have an overconcentration. We're able to get rid of, John, at pretty low cap rates, too at values in a lot of cases that are the highest, not just the pandemic, but we've ever seen and buy assets we really like at the same cap rates, even if they are, frankly, in the very low 4s and in the 3s, that's still a good trade for us. We still think that gives us that diversification we talk about, maybe a little better growth going forward. Again, we're always looking at newer assets, so we're not arbitraging new properties for old. We're typically buying in our markets. And in Denver, for example, assets that are 2016 vintage or newer."

But maybe we'll talk about the whole company for a second, and then we'll go to the market's question because we have been noodling on that a little. We're certainly not in a position to give '22 or 23 guidance. But I think when you look at how this company performed, equity residential perform coming out of recessions and thinking back to the tech bust in the 2002 vintage period and great financial crisis in '09. You've had a couple of years of negative growth. And then you've had kind of an in-between year, a transition year where we were right at 0 for same-store revenue. And then you've had that snapback that you're referring to, where we're averaging 5% for 3 or more years of same-store revenue growth. 
What I think is different this time or is likely to be, first off, the decline was much larger. Absolutely. Both last year and this year, larger than the order of magnitude in those 2 prior cases. But I think we're going to skip the transition year and go straight, given the velocity, Michael, speaking of. We're going to go straight to a number that's considerably higher than that sort of transitional 0 to de minimis same-store revenue growth. 
When you look by market, 1 market I was thinking a bit about before the call was New York. And we certainly hear a lot about New York and that kicked around a little bit. But when you look at the numbers after the great financial crisis, they had a couple of years. They had quarters where the numbers were 7% quarter-over-quarter. And I'd remind everyone that simply removing concessions is an 8% increase for a given lease in revenue year-over-year. 
So I think New York will put up some pretty good numbers, but in fairness, that's based on some pretty big declines. And I think the same is true for San Francisco. I think we've got a lot of confidence in Southern California. I think that market is doing very well. I think Seattle has been a little uneven. So I'll let Michael maybe comment on that. 
A lot of confidence in Boston, the recovery has been great in that market. There's a lot of good things happening in Boston. And again, in D.C., and we haven't talked about it in a while, but we're still going to have Amazon's HQ2 coming, and that's very close to numerous of our assets. So I feel like when I look at the markets, San Francisco and New York might post very significant quarter-over-quarter year-over-year numbers. But in fairness, that has to be judged by the level of decline that occurred the last few years. But when you just do compound numbers, I think Southern Cal is going to feel good. I think Boston is going to have a really nice recovery and come out of this more quickly than any place else. 
And I guess I'll defer to you, Michael, as you think about Seattle, because I just don't know how to think about that?"

I mean -- and when you look at single-family, and I was just out there with our Chief Investment Officer a few weeks ago in Denver, great quality of life, a lot of good things to say about job quality and lifestyle in Denver, but also single-family has gotten a lot more expensive. 
I mean, townhouse is that routinely are $600,000, nice homes but not elaborate. And again, our rents at that level compete well. And I feel like you could see some real outperformance for higher-end apartments in places like Denver and presumably places like Austin, the issue is that the market is pricing that in. 
And that cap rates are pretty darn low. But again, if we're trading out of assets we don't want, and it's at the same cap rate, and we're buying a better kind of growth stream, we think that math is going to work out for us."

The good news in that market is concessions have really abated. So now we have an opportunity just to grow that face rent. The opposite opportunity exists in New York right now, whereas concessions held down strong, and now our focus is let's keep trying to pull back those concessions. 
Even while concessions maintain that high level in the first quarter, we were trying to pressure test just raising up rate. So we have this a different opportunity in both of these markets to really go forward.

Well, I will tell you, I think on the past calls, I talked about the pressure we were having with studios and just not seeing a lot of demand for new leases there. That clearly is changing as we work our way through that first quarter and through April, just sequentially, from our point of April 23 to the end of that first quarter. We've improved 150 basis points in our occupancy of studios. So we're not back all the way where we were, but we're clearly starting to see that demand. And that's really an interesting standpoint because we're not seeing as much of the acceleration in the rate recovery on studios yet. 
So you're still seeing that attractive price point and that leads to that next demographic piece just from the overall affordability and like the household income. So what we've done is we're really focused right now in new residents that moved in with us during the first quarter. What do we know about them? 
So first, from the overall age profile and demographic, really pretty much in line with our historical average. Those move-ins had 33 -- they were 33 years old. It's a little bit less in like in New York market where we were 33.5. But historically, we were up in like a 35-year old, kind of moving in. So not a big change on the age. On the affordability index, which is really rent as a percent of income, we really saw no significant change across any of our markets. The portfolio is still averaging at 19%. So rent as a percent of income is 19%. When you drill into that because rates are still down, that means what gave is a little bit of a decline in the annual household income for our new residents moving in. 
It's just not a significant number, though. These are still affluent renters that are moving in with us. The most significant decline came in New York. But our average renters for Q1 household income was $215,000 in that market, and their rent to income ratio is still at 18.5%. So we've been kind of watching these demographic trends to see what's happening. The pattern of going after the larger units, the 1 and 2 bedrooms, we talked about on the last call, still there. We're well occupied on that front. Now the opportunity is studios."

So like where are people coming to us from the new residents as well as when we look where are our residents that are leaving going. And I will tell you in San Francisco, we're trending back towards normal pre-pandemic levels, but applications from within the same MSA and state, both still remain elevated. Huge improvement sequentially from what we saw in the Q3 and Q4 period of last year, but they're both still slightly elevated, which really just means that you're still seeing kind of this deal seeker or people trying to take advantage of it just moving within the market. 
The New York front has really almost returned back to normal. It still has some elevated level of deal seekers from within the same MSA. But really, that is materially lower. We were up in like 80% of all of our applications in New York were coming to us from within the same MSA. Right now, we're back down to 65%, which is right in line with our historical norms."

I mean, that's our goal, is to keep pushing and trying to find that resistance point. We haven't seen a change in the demographic profile. So I think from an affordability standpoint, the applicants coming in, they're all approved based on the gross rent. So regardless of concessions, they're approved on that gross rent and they're used to paying us that gross rent after they get past that first or second month. So I think that's something we'll have to watch in the markets where we -- like New York and San Fran, where we really kind of have momentum to dial back even more on that concession use. But to date, for the month of April, we have not seen any material change in that demographic."

Our thought isn't to compete with those sort of rework type remote work providers. It's more to provide an amenity to our residents that they're either paying for directly on a per use basis, maybe it's repurposed ground floor retail that we put a great Internet hub in and some furniture and then off to the races or maybe it's just space and existing amenities that were bifurcating a little bit more so people can use it. 
So I don't really have an ROI for you as much as it's stickiness. And I'll say that 1 thing we don't want to do is just hold on the empty retail for too long, assuming we can get cities to let us rezone it. We do have retail space that was vacated, and we're just giving a lot of thoughtfulness to whether we're just going to put new retail tenants in that space. And then have forbid 2, 3, 4 years later, go through the same experience again. Because retail is a tough business. We're glad we have very little of it. So we may repurpose some of that additional space as potentially amenity space for our residents. But you shouldn't expect us to use it significantly as an independent rental stream."

I would say on development, that's an area where in the past, we have used the ATM or have used other mechanisms to raise money because you can't 1031 into developments. You really need to have independent capital. Often, it's been pretty small. So we've used debt capital. But again, as our cost of equity improves here and as our -- it becomes a more relevant funding source, I'm open to it. Another way, by the way, to address our market concentration, our desire to rebalance is to make the whole company bigger. So you could use, again, ATMs and issuances to buy assets and not recycle. But as long as the 1031 and buy assets, I'm sorry, in new markets or in Denver, for example. But that's a process that could have more dilution associated with it.

I guess I understand the lower Capex, certainly, but how the IRR is that different or even better in a place like Denver with cap rates already pretty low.

I think the assets we're selling often do have significant capital that needs to be invested. And I appreciate that's more of an AFFO thing than an FFO thing. But as you know, we think a lot about CapEx at EQR. And so in a lot of these cases, we're buying new product in Denver, and we're selling old product in California. And so I think the shareholders are much better off on an AFFO basis. I'll also say, again, when we're in Denver, looking at $2 to $2.20 a foot rents per month in a place where incomes are rising very quickly. And we got a lot of momentum. That to me, as compared to $3.50, $4 rents in California, it makes me feel like, boy, why couldn't that number very quickly get to Seattle's number in the higher 2s and low 3s? 
Why can't that happen over an accelerated period of time? 
So we're not underwriting crazy numbers in Denver, but we are underwriting significant same-store significant rent growth in the first few years and then some sort of normalization. But I feel like I've got likely more upside in places like that for the reasons I just mentioned. And we already have tons of California exposure. So if California does draft up, as you said, even better, great. We already have -- we'll always have 40% of the company in that state. But maybe we don't need to have 45-plus percent in that state.

So when you think about a lot of units that don't have outside access that don't have windows, I think Michael would tell you, those are going to be card units to rent. We do have a couple of buildings in the portfolio that were repurposed. One is a great asset that used to be the U.S. steel headquarters down there the New York Stock Exchange on Broadway. That's a great asset that's really cool. It's also a pretty narrow asset. Everyone has window access and the [indiscernible] property works. We have some out West as well. Same thing, floor plate is a little bit smaller. There's an interior courtyard. I don't know what happens with a building that takes up half a block or more.

And what is the occupancy of that submarket that we're operating in. Because when we're looking at this, we're always trying to stay, call it, 100, 200 basis points above what we would say is market occupancy. But when -- right now, when you're in this recovery phase, the overall market occupancy is not as relevant as drilling in to the assets that you're competing against and what are those occupancies. 
So I think this balancing Act of clearly in these more hard hit areas, like the New York and San Francisco, is to really focus on recovering everything. Grab your occupancy and keep pushing aggressively on rate and dialing back concessions. San Francisco responded well on the pullback of concessions. New York was a little bit more resistant. And a lot of that has to do with the type of ownership that exists there."

But there may be buildings where we just can't move concessions. And Michael, but we've got great demand, but we just have that demand is super price sensitive. Then you'll see us just grow occupancy. But for the most part, now, we're in a better position. That demand we talked about in the fall, led to the occupancy improvements over the winter is leading to the pricing improvements now. And shortly, we hope will lead to the outer abatement of concessions, though that's not in our guidance. We think it sessions exist all the way through the fourth quarter, just a lot lower. But there's sort of this cycle we're in that I think is a very positive one."

We are pleased to report that we are seeing significant improvement in our operations, driven by continued strong demand all across our portfolio. This, in turn, allowed us to extend the gains in occupancy we discussed on the prior earnings call. 
We are currently 96% occupied, 160 basis point improvement since December 31, 2020. We are especially encouraged by our numbers as we enter our primary leasing season, the period of peak demand in our business and by the continuing reopening activities in our cities. The improving pricing we noted on last quarter's call has accelerated over the past few months. Pricing trend, which is a leading indicator of where market rents are going and is computed net of concessions, is up 14% this year, and we have already recovered 60% of the pricing reduction we suffered as a result of the pandemic. 
In fact, on a pricing trend basis, collective pricing in our markets outside of New York and San Francisco is likely to recover completely by the end of May. The New York and San Francisco markets declined by more than our other markets, so they have further to go to regain pre-pandemic pricing, but momentum is strong in those 2 markets, and they are making good progress towards full recovery. 
To provide additional color on our operating trends, we posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. 
After I give a quick overview of guidance changes and investment activities, Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide more detail on our current performance and forward trajectory. 
After that, we'll take your questions. 
The encouraging trends, I just mentioned, led us to raise our guidance ranges for physical occupancy, same-store revenue, same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations as disclosed in last night's release. 
The midpoint of our same-store revenue range was raised 100 basis points to negative 7%, the midpoint of our NOI range was raised 150 basis points to negative 12% and the midpoint of our NFFO range was raised by $0.05 to $2.75 per share. These improvements were almost entirely driven by stronger and earlier than anticipated recovery trends in both our residential and nonresidential operations across all our markets. 
We are well positioned heading into our prime leasing season, but our reported same-store revenue numbers will lag the recovery in our operating statistics as we work through the impact of lower rents and of concessions. 
In terms of the first quarter's numbers, the impact of the pandemic is readily apparent. We said previously that our reported same-store revenue numbers would get worse before they get better, and that's exactly what happened. Same-store revenues declined 10.5% for the quarter, which, while it was a bit better than we expected, is still among the worst revenue numbers in our history. 
We believe that our first quarter results will be our low point for the year and that they will improve from this point on. Turning to investments. While no dispositions or acquisitions closed this quarter, we have been active in the transaction market, and we expect to have a considerable amount of activity to report on next quarter. 
As we've said on prior calls, in order to create the most stable, growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are broadening our portfolio over time to increase our exposure to suburban properties in our existing markets, where the resident demographic is similar to our existing affluent urban resident population. 
We are also working on increasing our investment in Denver and continuing to consider a select number of new markets, that have large and growing affluent resident bases, favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and lower political risk. 
While asset prices are high in the locations in which we seek to invest, our funding source for these acquisitions comes from sales of existing properties, especially in California, where we are obtaining pricing that exceeds our pre-pandemic valuations. 
We expect to complete this transaction activity with minimal dilution and to stay consistent with our strategy of acquiring newer assets with modest capital expenditure burdens. The 1 piece of notable investment activity that did occur in the quarter was our $5 million investment and a fund that preserves affordable housing across our country. 
This for-profit fund is run by long time experts in the affordable housing preservation and finance area. Using our equity capital and that of other investors as well as government financing, the fund acquires and improves the quality of existing affordable housing communities that would otherwise be at risk of either physical neglect or where the affordable restrictions are about to expire. 
We have been clear on prior calls of our steadfast opposition to rent control and other short-sighted policies that do not help solve the affordable housing shortage. Economists consistently say that rent control, in fact, leads to disinvestment in existing housing and impedes the creation of new housing. 
We support solution-focused investment like this fund that preserve or create affordable housing and favor the elimination of overly restrictive zoning codes that limit housing production where it's needed most. 
Along with ongoing engagement with public officials in our markets, this investment demonstrates our commitment to being part of the solution with respect to the affordable housing gap. 
To sum up, we are encouraged by the progress being made on vaccinations as well as the reopening of cities. Recent announcements made by employers, particularly in the tech industry regarding return to office are welcome news. We believe that the new operating model for most companies will be a hybrid of in-office and work from home and that our portfolio will benefit from workers looking to live close to the office. 
The unique cultural and entertainment options that are becoming available again, as cities reopen, are also magnets to our affluent renter demographic, and will draw them back to the cities and to the lifestyle, many of them crave. 
Our customer base has stayed well employed during the pandemic and can afford our current rents and absorb future rent increases as market conditions improve. 2021 is indeed turning out to be a year of recovery for our company. As we have said before, equity residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions has typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. 
All of this is, of course, premised on continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other economic conditions remain supportive. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support during these challenging times. We are well positioned to benefit from a return to normal as the pandemic subsides. We are optimistic about the future of our business and believe that our portfolio will thrive. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael?"

So with the first quarter now in the books and our spring leasing season ramping up, we continue to see strong performance build upon the early indicators we were seeing on our last call. The accelerated distribution of the vaccines have clearly had an impact on many of the states and cities where we operate as they push for return to a more normal environment. 
Our teams in our various markets are sharing positive news of neighborhoods that are starting to feel alive again as more and more companies get ready to reopen offices. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of work-from-home, we see our demographic is drawn to the amazing culture, food and art that our urban locations offer. They're excited about reopening of these experiences and feel a sense of urgency to return, especially knowing that these lower rents won't last for long. 
As you may remember from prior calls, we have focused our approach on maximizing revenues by balancing occupancy with rate and concessions, which has proved successful thus far. Our confidence in the recoveries of our cities, coupled with this disciplined approach, kept us from overreacting in 1 direction or the other and we are well positioned as the recovery takes off to sell our excess inventory at net effective rates that are currently 14% higher than the end of last year. 
In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, demand. Demand was strong through both the winter season and early spring with a continued trend of increased applications and move-in activity that is well above seasonal norms and has fueled a stronger-than-expected occupancy recovery. 
Occupancy is currently 96%. And as of 2 weeks ago, is now above the prior year comp period. And for the first time, beginning to approach 2019 levels. This occupancy strength is contributing to the improvement in our revenue growth recovery. 
Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions and is a good indicator of where market rents are headed, has improved across all markets during the first quarter and through April. We continue to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. 
In January, concessions averaged just under 6 weeks on about 1/3 of our applications. By March and into April, this has been reduced to about 20% of applications receiving on average 4 weeks, and we expect this to continue to decline into May. As stated in the management presentation, we have seen a 14% improvement in pricing trend from December 31 to April 23. Renewal rate negotiation pressure continues as we renew residents who signed leases at the onset of the pandemic before the declines and pricing trends occurred. 
Outside of Southern California and Denver, our other markets have pricing trend below prior year, which put pressure on renewal negotiations. This situation is improving weekly. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the other markets, excluding New York and San Francisco, to be positive by the end of May. April renewal rate achieved should be 200 basis points better than March, which was a negative 4.5%. The percent of residents renewing also continues to improve, with March and April, both achieving above 55%. These levels remain below our historical average for this time of year, but the gap is closing. 
Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved continue to improve with sequential improvement in new lease change expected for the next several quarters. As previously discussed, renewal rate achieved was pressured in Q1, but the pressure will continue to moderate as pricing trend improves and as the rate on expiring leases which were written pre and early onset in the pandemic narrows with current market rents. 
On Pages 6 through 8 of our management presentation, we have provided color on pricing trends, physical occupancy, percent of residents renewing and leasing concessions for each market. So I will not repeat that here. But let me provide some brief market-specific commentary. I will start in Boston, where we are seeing an uptick in interest from students as many colleges have announced plans for campuses to open again in the fall. 
We may well benefit from limits on dorm occupancies as some students will need to find alternative housing. This market will face some headwinds from new supply, particularly in the city, where we are still dealing with some non-stabilized lease-ups from last year as well as a few new deals expected to deliver in the back half of 2021. 
New York is starting to see positive momentum. Demand is good, driven by both bargain hunters looking to upgrade and people returning to Manhattan in anticipation of office reopenings. 
Specifics around office reopenings remain unclear, but indications are that it will be a hybrid that has employees back in the office, at least part of the week by summer and early fall. In New York, concessions remain part of the marketing strategy, even while we are raising rates. This market held on to widespread concession use through most of the first quarter, but the last several weeks has shown concession use starting to decline. 
Unlike any of our other markets, New York has a more significant number of local operators not on yield management, who tend to use concessions more frequently. New supply is basically nonexistent in Manhattan, however, supply pressure on the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey in the back half of this year may impact that submarket. Our migration data suggests that this market is beginning to return to normal as applications from outside the New York MSA and move-outs leaving the MSA, both continue to trend closer to normal pre-pandemic levels. 
Turning to D.C. During the pandemic, physical occupancy held up better in D.C. than any of our other East Coast markets. Absorption of new supply also has generally remained healthy that has slowed compared to 2019 levels. 
While demand in this market remains robust, we are facing some headwinds from new supply in 2021. D.C. has an excellent track record of absorbing new supply, but with more than 12,000 units being delivered this year, that track record will be challenged. 
Heading to the West Coast. Seattle trends are moving in the right direction, but the market has shown periods of price resistance. Tech companies continue to hire and are moving towards reopening offices. Amazon's recent announcement of its commitment to an office centric culture as their baseline is a very good sign for driving demand. The expiration of the H1B visa ban at the end of March should also be a good driver of demand as the tech sector was heavily reliant on this program for talent. On the supply front, new supply deliveries will rebound in 2021 with the largest concentration in the CBD down town submarket.
San Francisco, one of the markets hardest hit by the pandemic is clearly on the road to recovery. Concession use in this market has shown a meaningful decline. Our communities located in the city of San Francisco are starting to feel vibrant again. Late in the first quarter, we saw a flurry of announcements from Bay Area tech firms with regards to return to office. 
Many of the tech firms, including Google, are taking a firmer than expected stance with regards to office attendance, as they recognize the importance of in-person work in both product creation and company culture. Schools are reopening with colleges planning for students to return to campus in the fall, and demand for our 2 and 3 bedrooms has clearly increased in the last several weeks. 
New supply will be elevated in 2021 with a large concentration in the South Bay, which may create some pricing headwinds for us. Southern California has been the strongest part of our portfolio during the pandemic. Los Angeles, despite being 1 of the most lockdown cities in the country, continues to have good demand. The city is opening back up, and the governor has set mid-June for a full reopening. The most encouraging sign in this market is the pickup in activity in the content creation sector. 
Television and movies that were filming in other states during the pandemic are returning to LA. 2021 new supply deliveries will be well spread out across the submarkets, with most of the expected pressure coming to us in the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket. Orange County and San Diego continue to be the real standouts in terms of performance. These markets have the highest occupancies and the best, albeit still negative, revenue performance. But we see same-store revenue growth in these markets turning positive in the second quarter. 
These markets should continue to benefit as the state opens back up, and travel and leisure activity picks up. New supply will be at normal levels and generally well spread out across the submarkets. While Southern California is generally 1 of our better performing areas, it has and continues to experience the highest levels of delinquency. 
We have mobilized our teams to assist our residents in applying for available federal rental assistance dollars, while California was ahead of most states in creating a rental assistant application process. The state is just beginning to process applications and to send out money. We will be aggressive in pursuing these California relief funds as well as other programs throughout the country. 
Finally, in Denver, demand remained strong across the market, although pricing pressure and widespread concession use is common downtown. Our 2 suburban Denver properties have little concession use and are seeing good demand and revenue growth, new supply will be elevated from 2020 levels, but good job growth should be a driver of the absorption of that supply. 
Across all of our markets, our focus will remain on increasing rates and continuing to reduce and eliminate concessions, our strategy of not chasing occupancy at any cost during the winter is paying off. So far, we have been able to grow our occupancy, while at the same time, recovering just over 60% of the decline in rate that we experienced from March to December of 2020. 
We believe that this approach will continue to benefit us as we move forward through 2021 and close that gap. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. I am confident that we have the best team in the industry, and they are demonstrating the power of working together as they lead the markets through the recovery phase and remain relentless in serving our customers and taking care of each other. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

So I think the way to think about this is pricing trend from Page 5 in that management presentation is the leading indicator of where the improvement is going to come to blended rate. And then after you see the improvement in blended rate, you start to see the improvement in revenue growth. 
So I think there's probably about a month or 2 lag that you start to see as we'll start to cross over. Now remember, the comp period from last year gets easier as we work our way through May and June. So our focus is really around that pre-pandemic period, which is what were rents like in each 1 of these assets at the very beginning of March 2020, and where we have good acceleration, we're focused on what was that high mark from '19 and how fast can we go after that. 
So I think as we keep pushing forward and keep getting that momentum over prior year, you'll start to see that blended rate improvement really kick into gear. You could see what happened just sequentially from March to April. I would expect you're going to see that same kind of real big pop as you work your way, April into May."

So I'm going to look at cap rates, talk a little bit about cap rates with you, though we all know that's only part of the picture. A lot of these markets, almost all of them that we're either in or interested in with the exception of Manhattan, Brooklyn and call it, the city of San Francisco are trading at or higher than they did at the pandemic period. 
So we were looking at cap rates, for example, in Denver, 3.75% to 4.25%. I mean there isn't a market that's screening cheap. And in terms of expensive, I'd say the recovery is well-priced in. It's probably a charitable way to say it. I think these cap rates are low because people have confidence because even in the Sun Belt markets or places like Denver, there were declines in revenue. 
And I think what people are seeing is you're going to make that up, and you're going to make that up pretty quickly. And so they're willing to kind of capitalize that into the price. So with the NOI is still relatively low, that makes the cap rates low. So I guess I'd say there aren't any bargains we see. But what works for us is if we can sell some of these assets that whether it's locational or we have an overconcentration. 
We're able to get rid of, John, at pretty low cap rates, too at values in a lot of cases that are the highest, not just the pandemic, but we've ever seen and buy assets we really like at the same cap rates, even if they are, frankly, in the very low 4s and in the 3s, that's still a good trade for us. 
We still think that gives us that diversification we talk about, maybe a little better growth going forward. Again, we're always looking at newer assets, so we're not arbitraging new properties for old. We're typically buying in our markets. And in Denver, for example, assets that are 2016 vintage or newer."

But maybe we'll talk about the whole company for a second, and then we'll go to the market's question because we have been noodling on that a little. We're certainly not in a position to give '22 or '23 guidance. 
But I think when you look at how this company performed, Equity Residential perform coming out of recessions and thinking back to the tech bust in the 2002 vintage period and great financial crisis in '09. You've had a couple of years of negative growth. 
And then you've had kind of an in-between year, a transition year where we were right at zero for same-store revenue. And then you've had that snapback that you're referring to, where we're averaging 5% for 3 or more years of same-store revenue growth. 
What I think is different this time or is likely to be, first off, the decline was much larger. Absolutely. Both last year and this year, larger than the order of magnitude in those 2 prior cases. But I think we're going to skip the transition year and go straight, given the velocity, Michael is speaking of. We're going to go straight to a number that's considerably higher than that sort of transitional zero to de minimis same-store revenue growth. 
When you look by market, 1 market I was thinking a bit about before the call was New York. And we certainly hear a lot about New York and that kicked around a little bit. But when you look at the numbers after the great financial crisis, they had a couple of years. They had quarters where the numbers were 7% quarter-over-quarter. And I'd remind everyone that simply removing concessions is an 8% increase for a given lease in revenue year-over-year. 
So I think New York will put up some pretty good numbers, but in fairness, that's based on some pretty big declines. And I think the same is true for San Francisco. I think we've got a lot of confidence in Southern California. I think that market is doing very well. I think Seattle has been a little uneven. So I'll let Michael maybe comment on that. 
A lot of confidence in Boston, the recovery has been great in that market. There's a lot of good things happening in Boston. And again, in D.C., and we haven't talked about it in a while, but we're still going to have Amazon's HQ2 coming, and that's very close to numerous of our assets. So I feel like when I look at the markets, San Francisco and New York might post very significant quarter-over-quarter year-over-year numbers. 
But in fairness, that has to be judged by the level of decline that occurred the last few years. But when you just do compound numbers, I think Southern Cal is going to feel good. I think Boston is going to have a really nice recovery and come out of this more quickly than any place else. 
And I guess I'll defer to you, Michael, as you think about Seattle, because I just don't know how to think about that?"

I mean -- and when you look at single-family, and I was just out there with our Chief Investment Officer a few weeks ago in Denver, great quality of life, a lot of good things to say about job quality and lifestyle in Denver, but also single-family has gotten a lot more expensive. 
I mean, townhouse is that routinely are $600,000, nice homes but not elaborate. And again, our rents at that level compete well. And I feel like you could see some real out-performance for higher-end apartments in places like Denver and presumably places like Austin, the issue is that the market is pricing that in. 
And that cap rates are pretty darn low. But again, if we're trading out of assets we don't want, and it's at the same cap rate, and we're buying a better kind of growth stream, we think that math is going to work out for us."

If you isolate like Downtown, San Francisco to the 9 properties or 2,500 units we have. We're still materially off from where we were at this time last year. 
The good news in that market is concessions have really abated. So now we have an opportunity just to grow that face rent. The opposite opportunity exists in New York right now, whereas concessions held down strong, and now our focus is let's keep trying to pull back those concessions. Even while concessions maintain that high level in the first quarter, we were trying to pressure test just raising up rate. 
So we have this a different opportunity in both of these markets to really go forward. So I wouldn't say it's -- let's pause occupancy and claw back all the rate or let's keep rates where they are and get all the occupancy. It's this constant push on both levers."

Well, I will tell you, I think on the past calls, I talked about the pressure we were having with studios and just not seeing a lot of demand for new leases there. That clearly is changing as we work our way through that first quarter and through April, just sequentially, from our point of April 23 to the end of that first quarter. We've improved 150 basis points in our occupancy of studios. 
So we're not back all the way where we were, but we're clearly starting to see that demand. And that's really an interesting standpoint because we're not seeing as much of the acceleration in the rate recovery on studios yet. 
So you're still seeing that attractive price point and that leads to that next demographic piece just from the overall affordability and like the household income. So what we've done is we're really focused right now in new residents that moved in with us during the first quarter. What do we know about them? 
So first, from the overall age profile and demographic, really pretty much in line with our historical average. Those move-ins had 33 -- they were 33 years old. It's a little bit less in like in New York market where we were 33.5. But historically, we were up in like a 35-year old, kind of moving in. So not a big change on the age. 
On the affordability index, which is really rent as a percent of income, we really saw no significant change across any of our markets. The portfolio is still averaging at 19%. So rent as a percent of income is 19%. When you drill into that because rates are still down, that means what gave is a little bit of a decline in the annual household income for our new residents moving in. 
It's just not a significant number, though. These are still affluent renters that are moving in with us. The most significant decline came in New York. But our average renters for Q1 household income was $215,000 in that market, and their rent to income ratio is still at 18.5%. So we've been kind of watching these demographic trends to see what's happening. The pattern of going after the larger units, the 1 and 2 bedrooms, we talked about on the last call, still there. We're well occupied on that front. Now the opportunity is studios."

Huge improvement sequentially from what we saw in the Q3 and Q4 period of last year, but they're both still slightly elevated, which really just means that you're still seeing kind of this deal seeker or people trying to take advantage of it just moving within the market. The New York front has really almost returned back to normal. 
It still has some elevated level of deal seekers from within the same MSA. But really, that is materially lower.

I mean, that's our goal, is to keep pushing and trying to find that resistance point. We haven't seen a change in the demographic profile. So I think from an affordability standpoint, the applicants coming in, they're all approved based on the gross rent. So regardless of concessions, they're approved on that gross rent and they're used to paying us that gross rent after they get past that first or second month. 
So I think that's something we'll have to watch in the markets where we -- like New York and San Fran, where we really kind of have momentum to dial back even more on that concession use. But to date, for the month of April, we have not seen any material change in that demographic."

So we're trying to be careful. We're certainly happy that we're improving, and we see that as an absolute. But pretty soon, it won't be relevant to judge us against 2020 anymore. It's when do we get back to pre-pandemic 2019, early, early 2020, and we're making progress towards that. 
So to answer your question, yes, that will probably happen and those lines will cross. That's partly because we do feel like we can keep pushing pricing trend, that's partly because it went down so hard in 2020 in fairness. But I think you're going to see us talk more and more if things keep going this well about how and when we'll get back to late 2019, early, early 2020 type of pricing. Is that helpful?"

The other thing you got to remember with the use of concessions is many times, what we're doing right now is we'll have concessions in place on vacant units to create the sense of urgency to fill our vacancy, and we will not offer concessions on noticed units, which is residents that said they're moving out somewhere at the end of May or into June.

So I don't really have an ROI for you as much as its stickiness.

And then you haven't forbid 2, 3, 4 years later, go through the same experience again. Because retail is a tough business. We're glad we have very little of it.

I would say on development, that's an area where in the past, we have used the ATM or have used other mechanisms to raise money because you can't 1031 into developments. You really need to have independent capital. Often, it's been pretty small. 
So we've used debt capital. But again, as our cost of equity improves here and as our -- it becomes a more relevant funding source, I'm open to it. Another way, by the way, to address our market concentration, our desire to rebalance is to make the whole company bigger. 
So you could use, again, ATMs and issuances to buy assets and not recycle. But as long as the 1031 -- and buy assets, I'm sorry, in new markets or in Denver, for example. But that's a process that could have more dilution associated with it. So I just want to be kind of thoughtful about it."

I think the assets we're selling often do have significant capital that needs to be invested. And I appreciate that's more of an AFFO thing than an FFO thing.

And so I think the shareholders are much better off on an AFFO basis. I'll also say, again, when we're in Denver, looking at $2 to $2.20 a foot rents per month in a place where incomes are rising very quickly. And we got a lot of momentum. That to me, as compared to $3.50, $4 rents in California, it makes me feel like, boy, why couldn't that number very quickly get to Seattle's number in the higher 2s and low 3s? 
Why can't that happen over an accelerated period of time?  So we're not underwriting crazy numbers in Denver, but we are underwriting significant same-store -- significant rent growth in the first few years and then some sort of normalization.

Well, first off, anything that helps the affordable housing shortage is worth trying. So we'll start with that premise. Because, again, some of the conversations or articles I've read and you've likely read are about, can that help with affordable housing. I'm not sure, but let's give it a world because that's a real issue. 
But we -- the problem with converting offices, often, these are older office buildings, large floor plates, limited windows. So when you think about a lot of units that don't have outside access that don't have windows, I think Michael would tell you, those are going to be card units to rent. 
We do have a couple of buildings in the portfolio that were repurposed. One is a great asset that used to be the U.S. Steel headquarters down there the New York Stock Exchange on Broadway. That's a great asset that's really cool. It's also a pretty narrow asset. Everyone has window access and the property works. 
We have some out-West as well. Same thing, floor plate is a little bit smaller. There's an interior courtyard. I don't know what happens with a building that takes up half a block or more. And you're just trying to turn it all into apartments. I'm not sure how that's going to work. So I'm not that concerned with it as competitive to higher-end apartments. 
And I think we'd be open to trying to figure out a way to make it into affordable units. But again, this window issue is not a small one. Most people want to see the outdoors. I mean that's -- again, I think Mike will be very unhappy if we gave them hundreds of units to rent without windows."

The only thing I would tell you from the ranges and the shifting of the ranges that you have to keep in perspective is where we started from. And that range, that initial NFFO range that we gave at the beginning of the year was very wide, right? So with a $0.20 difference. 
So it was probably abnormally wide relative to typical years in other time frames. But I wouldn't read anything into we shifted up the guidance range on revenue, on NOI and then we paired off the bottom end of the NFFO range, but I won't read anything of not raising the top end, if I'm answering your question."

But is that we continue to see the good momentum that Michael has kind of outlined, and we continue to see the reductions that we mentioned, for instance, between like March and April. 
So we continue to think on a cash basis that they will decline. Because of the GAAP treatment and the straight-line amortization, in fact, we think that the cash numbers are going to flip soon such that the cash numbers are better than the GAAP numbers, meaning you're amortizing more concessions than you're actually granting on new ones. 
So you saw in the first quarter, the GAAP number was better than the reported cash number. I think that's going to flip, and that's what's encompassed in our guidance, if that makes sense. But it's a continued decline as we work through the recovery, and we're already seeing that well on the way, as Michael outlined."

And so I guess I'm wondering why if you're going into the higher turnover season over the next second quarter, third quarter? Why if you're still below on occupancy than sort of long-term goals? Why would you be pulling back concessions in the market?"

But when -- right now, when you're in this recovery phase, the overall market occupancy is not as relevant as drilling into the assets that you're competing against and what are those occupancies. So I think this balancing Act of clearly in these more hard-hit areas, like the New York and San Francisco, is to really focus on recovering everything. 
Grab your occupancy and keep pushing aggressively on rate and dialing back concessions. San Francisco responded well on the pullback of concessions. New York was a little bit more resistant. And a lot of that has to do with the type of ownership that exists there."

I mean we intend to raise both rate, diminish concessions and drive occupancy. But there may be buildings where we just can't move concessions. And Michael, but we've got great demand, but we just have that demand is super price sensitive. Then you'll see us just grow occupancy. But for the most part, now, we're in a better position. 
That demand we talked about in the fall, led to the occupancy improvements over the winter is leading to the pricing improvements now. And shortly, we hope will lead to the other abatement of concessions, though that's not in our guidance. We think concessions exist all the way through the fourth quarter, just a lot lower.

Then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see the remainder of the year playing out, followed by Bob Garechana and any color on our guidance changes and balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. Also, as Marty mentioned, we are pleased to have Alex Brackenridge, EQR's Chief Investment Officer, available during the Q&A period. 
For those of you who do not know Alex, he's a 28-year veteran in this company. He literally started work here the day we went public in 1993. And and took over as our CIO in 2020. As you can see from the release, he and his team have done exceptional work of late on the transaction side. 
Turning to operations. All of our operating metrics continue to improve at a faster rate than we assumed earlier in the year. We are seeing demand levels well above 2019 in all our markets. And this has allowed us to continue growing occupancy, while at the same time raising rates. This resulted in a company materially raising annual same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO guidance while our quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results remained negative, the decline was less than what we expected and our sequential same-store revenue and NOI showed positive growth for the first time since the pandemic began. 
As we have discussed on prior calls, improvement in our reported quarter-over-quarter same-store numbers will lag the recovery in our operating fundamentals as we work these now higher rents and lower concessions through our rent roll. We believe that our business is set up for an extended period of higher than trend growth beginning in 2022 as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes in our target demographic. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. 
On the investment side, we are active buyers and sellers in the second quarter and expect to continue being active capital recyclers. Consistent with what I've said on prior calls, we are allocating capital to places that are attractive to our affluent renter base, including the suburbs of our established coastal markets as well as Denver and our 2 new markets of Austin and Atlanta. We are making these trades with no dilution, even given higher pricing levels for the properties we are targeting because we are able to sell our older and less desirable properties at low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates. 
Earlier this month, we reentered the Texas market after an 11-year absence by acquiring 2 well-located new assets in Austin, Texas. These properties are located in a desirable area with high housing costs that is equidistant between Downtown Austin and the Domain Hub on the north side. 
We acquired these 2 properties for $96 million and approximately a 3.9% cap rate and about $195,000 per unit. We expect to acquire a mix of urban and suburban assets in the Austin market. During the second quarter and in July, we acquired 2 properties in Atlanta. Sky House South in Midtown for $115 million with a 3.6% cap rate. This is a deal we did previously disclose. 
And a few days ago, we acquired a second property in Atlanta in the bustling Midtown West neighborhood. We acquired this new property for $135 million, and it is about half occupied. And once it completes lease-up, we expect it will stabilize at a 4.1% cap rate. 
We also continued adding to our Denver presence by purchasing an asset in the suburban Central Park area of Denver for $95 million. This property is located just west of the large and growing Fitzsimons medical campus draws residents attracted to its access to abundant outdoor amenities. We expect this property, which is also in lease-up currently, to stabilize at a 4.2% cap rate. We're also pleased to add to the portfolio of property each in the suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C. 
The Boston property is located in Burlington, Massachusetts and is a new asset that we acquired for $134.5 million at a 4.1% cap rate. This property is in a difficult-to-build suburb of Boston with high single-family housing costs and good access to high-paying jobs. The D.C. asset is located in Fairfax, Virginia, and is a 2016 asset that we acquired for $70 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is well located with both good highway and good metro access and proximity to the growing job base in Northern Virginia. 
Both the Burlington and Fairfax assets are located in submarkets where our existing assets have performed particularly well. Year-to-date, we have bought $645 million of properties and expect to close on another $850 million in acquisitions, a good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation by the end of the year. 
We will fund these buys with an approximately equivalent amount of dispositions, mostly from California of older and less desirable assets, which we sold are under contract to sell at significantly above our pre-pandemic estimate of value. 
Turning to development. We put into service and began leasing our newly developed property in Alameda Island, a short ferry ride to the city of San Francisco, built on the site of a former naval base. This property has terrific views of the skyline and an evolving restaurant in bars that we think is attractive to our clientele. 
Over the next few months, we will complete our other 2 current development projects, including the Alcott in Central Boston, the largest development project in the company's history. Early leasing efforts on this project and our development project in Bethesda, Maryland are going well. And our current estimates are that these 3 projects will stabilize at a development yield of approximately 5%, considerably higher than prevailing acquisition cap rates. These properties will be meaningful contributors to NFFO starting in late 2022. We see development as a good complement to our acquisition activities as we spread more of our footprint to the suburbs of our established markets as well as to our new markets. 
We expect a significant amount of our development activity going forward to be done through joint venture arrangements. This allows us to leverage our partners in place sourcing and entitlement teams in locations like our new markets where we do not currently have a development presence. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during this particularly busy leasing season, and we're all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael."

As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the ove",1089,"Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. 
Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, we continue to see very good demand for our apartment homes. Our national call center and Ella, our AI leasing agent, are responding to record high levels of inbound interest for our apartments which is converting into high volumes of self-guided tours. This overall level of demand continues to drive applications and move in. Portfolio-wide physical occupancy is currently 96.5%, which is back to 2019 levels. and Southern California markets are slightly above. 
At this point, we expect to run the portfolio above 96% through the remainder of the third quarter. This strength in occupancy is allowing us to push rate and drive revenue growth. Overall, we are more than halfway through the typical peak leasing season and the momentum has been very strong, providing us the opportunity to raise rates, reduce concessions and grow occupancy. These fundamentals are delivering RV recovery. 
From March to December of 2020, pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions, declined approximately $500 per unit. From January 2021 to today, pricing trend has grown $660 and is now not only above prior year levels in all markets, but every market, except for San Francisco is also above 2019 peak pricing trend levels. Today, the portfolio is approximately $100 higher per unit than our peak 2019 levels. Our priority has been to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. At the end of the first quarter, about 20% of applications we're receiving on average 4 weeks in concessions. 
As of July, we are now running with less than 3% of our applications receiving on average just over 2 weeks, and we expect this to continue to drop off even further. To give you perspective, the total dollar of concessions granted peaked in the month of February at just north of $6 million for the same-store portfolio. 
For July, we will be at $1.5 million for the month, and August should be less than $750,000. Last week, only 12 properties had any concessions being offered. The percent of residents renewing has stabilized around 55%, which is very much in line with historical averages but below the record high 60% levels that we had in 2019 and early 2020. 
As you saw in the press release, achieved renewal increase, new lease change and blended rate all continued to improve in July, and we expect further improvement through the balance of the year as the comp period becomes more favorable and the business continues to strengthen. 
As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus will continue to be to push rates in our markets and manage our renewal negotiations. In our management presentation, we provided color on all of our markets but I wanted to take a minute to highlight New York and San Francisco as they tend to be the markets we receive the most questions about. Both markets are recovering nicely with concession use nearly nonexistent in our New York portfolio and declining rapidly in San Francisco. 
New York is seeing stronger demand right now, and we think it is primarily due to greater clarity around employer return to office plans. New York employers, particularly the banks and financial firms have called their employees back to the office, and you could feel it in the economic activity in many areas of Manhattan. We see it in our portfolio after 9 consecutive weeks of record application volume. In San Francisco, however, the return to office and reopening is a little more ambiguous. Employers have been slower to call employees back in with many initially targeting after Labor Day. Adding to the uncertainty in San Francisco is the reintroduction of strong recommendations for indoor masking and some delays in reopening, which were announced last week, the situation market and a slower full recovery of occupancy. 
That said, occupancy is 95.4% today in San Francisco and is growing as is pricing trend. At this pace, we expect the San Francisco pricing trend to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are seeing some indicators that we could see an extended leasing season with a second wave of demand in New York, Boston and Seattle. Our leasing teams in these markets have been dealing with prospects that are looking for move-in dates in late August and September and hearing from them that these moves are in connection with their need to be back in the office or in the case of Boston back on campus. This demand is more robust than historical patterns, which could suggest an extended peak leasing season in those markets, and matches up nicely with our lease expirations, which are more weighted towards the back of the year than usual. 
Combining all of the data points I've just shared and those included in the management presentation, we see an unprecedented opportunity to grow sequential revenue over the next several quarters as the impact of better rates, nearly nonexisting concessions and higher occupancy compound. We acknowledge how badly our operations declined over the last 16 months, but the current recovery appears to be strong enough to both quickly recapture all that was lost in the pandemic and take us into a new period of strong operating fundamentals. 
Finally, I want to take a minute and give you an update on the government assistance program for renters. As we've discussed on previous calls, approximately $50 billion in rental assistance for those impacted financially by the pandemic was made available in the various relief bills. We are laser-focused on accessing the rental relief funds and are working very closely with our eligible residents to apply for this relief. 
Processing to date has been relatively slow in our markets, but we were able to recover approximately $5 million in the quarter. Bob will provide some color on our expectations for collections for the remainder of 2021 in his remarks. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. This pace of recovery would not be possible without them, and they remain relentless in taking care of each other and serving our customers. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob."
28209,1672705410,2352893,"Equity Residential, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night's release, along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet and capital markets. As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and",647,"Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night's release, along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet and capital markets. As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and is exceeding our prior expectations for the same-store portfolio. The continued strong operating momentum from this leasing season has led us to raise our annual same-store revenue guidance from negative 6% to negative 8% to negative 4% to negative 5%, an improvement at the midpoint of 250 basis points. Strong expense controls and favorable real estate tax outcomes which I will talk about in a moment also allowed us to reduce our same-store expense guidance range to an increase of 2.75% to 3.25%, resulting in an NOI range of negative 7.5% to negative 8.5%, which is a 400 basis point improvement at the midpoint relative to our prior guidance. 
Drivers of our revenue guidance increase of 250 basis points are roughly 150 basis points of improving operating fundamentals that Michael just outlined, 60 basis points or $15 million for the full year and related lower bad debt, primarily due to anticipated rental assistance collections and the remaining 40 basis points is due to improved performance in our nonresidential business. 
Before I move on to expenses, a quick comment on our bad debt assumptions. The back half of the year has about $10 million of additional assumed rental assistance collections on top of the $5 million we've already received. We feel very confident about this amount because we either received it in July or after some real digging can see that it is far along in the approval process. There are other resident accounts being worked on, but they are not as far along. 
Given the lack of transparency and the relative slow processing speed to date, it is difficult to handicap how much will successfully get processed and whether we will receive these funds in 2021 or it will spill over into 2022. 
On the expense side, we have also seen improvements versus prior expectations, which led us to center the midpoint of expense guidance at 3%, which was the low end of our prior guidance range. This reduction is in part due to the modest growth experienced in Q2 2021 even with a really challenging comparable period from Q2 of 2020. While some expense categories experienced a typically high percentage growth change quarter-over-quarter due to this comparability issue, overall expenses were less than originally anticipated. 
Key categories driving the current period and anticipated full year lower were real estate taxes and payroll. Reduction in growth expectations for real estate taxes is primarily driven by lower than forecasted excess values in some key markets. 
Lower payroll growth expectations are primarily driven by our progress in optimizing staffing utilization as well as higher-than-usual staffing vacancies. We expect that 2021 will be our third consecutive year of low payroll growth, having delivered a 3-year average below 1%, while keeping other controllable expenses like repairs and maintenance in check. 
As a result of these same-store guidance changes, we raised the midpoint of our normalized FFO from $2.75 to $2.90. A couple of closing comments on the balance sheet and debt capital markets. With the impact of the pandemic on our operations increasingly in the rearview mirror, it is clear that our balance sheet has held up remarkably well. Despite unprecedented pressure on operations, our credit metrics have remained well within our stated net debt-to-EBITDA leverage policy of between 5.5x to 6.5x. 
The debt capital markets are also incredibly attractive at the moment for issuers like us. This creates opportunities to term out commercial paper with treasuries and credit spreads at or near record lows, the potential of which has been incorporated into our revised guidance range. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

So that's really the total tie of possibility if you think about it. When you break it down kind of more granularly, we always run with $10 million, $11 million worth of receivable or bad debt. So it's probably a number that's a little bit below that. And again, so that leaves probably another 5 to 10 potential long run. 
The really hard part, as I kind of mentioned in my remarks, is just the frequency and the process associated with this. So it's a pretty long process. Michael's team is all over it. We've gotten the best transparency we could, but it does require both the resident and us to match information to get it run through the process. And then it takes a while to even after approved, have the cash kind of come through the door. And that's where the volatility arises in the numbers, which we wanted to highlight and be really clear about given what we have in guidance."

So I'm going to kick it over to him to talk a little bit about how long it takes to kind of create a portfolio that makes sense in those markets. But I want to point out to you that it depends also on the saleability. If we're able to continue to sell properties well, that will fuel the engine to buy properties well. So it depends both on transaction volume in those new markets that Alex will speak to and our ability to continue to dispose as we very successfully done the date of properties at good prices in places like California, New York and D.C., where we're trying to lighten the load a bit."

As you think about next year, we are doing some things now with some lease terms for the new leases we're writing. 
But again, we saw about a 5% shift, so meaning we have about a 5% more expirations in the back half of 2021 than we normally would have otherwise seen. My guess is over the course of 2022, that clearly starts to mitigate back towards a normal pattern. But again, the strength of the fourth quarter this year could put us in a situation where we'll have more expirations in the fourth quarter of next year as well.

And by that, I'm going to refer to not only the age of the new residents that moved in, in the quarter, but also the average household income for those residents. 
So during the second quarter, our average age for move-ins was 30 -- just over 33 years old, slightly below the historical average for second quarters in previous years that was at 34, but pretty much right in line. And when you think about the overall affordability index, I've said on previous calls, our range of rent as a percent of income between all of our markets goes between 17 at the low to 23% at the high. 
And as a portfolio for the move-ins that occurred in the second quarter, we were just over 19%. And that is very much in line with the historical averages for this portfolio. So I think what you take away from that is our rents clearly have increased sequentially. And -- but so have the average household incomes for the residents that have been moving in. So sequentially, we averaged at $152,000 was the average household income in the second quarter, that's up from just under $150,000 for move-ins in the first quarter.

But again, when you start doing large-scale transactions, you can end up competing against different groups of people. Some of the deals we've done were off-market transactions. We located them on our own. So we are very open to portfolio transactions. We're open, for example, to OP unit operating partnership unit deals, which often end up being larger deals as well. But we just haven't seen a lot of that offered and a lot of the portfolios we do see have some assets we like and a lot of assets we don't. So buying them one at a time gives us an advantage.

I think to your point, we need to learn to manage this and live with this virus. As much as we all were hoping it was just done and over. I think it's going to be part of our lives for an extended period of time. 
On the good side, we've all sort of learned or many of us have learned how to live with it. And I think society will manage through it. I think if you do have widespread city closures, that could be a concern and would certainly be a derailer for us. I would say though that as you think about the way we've all learned about how lockdowns work, the mental health impact on people, the economic disarray that lockdowns close, these sort of citywide shutdowns, the deferral of other needed medical procedures. There's a lot of good reasons when -- especially when you have a vaccine that 60% of the population over 16 has taken at least 1 dose of. That seems like a more thoughtful way to proceed along with masks to us. So we're not trying to whistle past the graveyard or otherwise ignore the Delta variant. It's just our sense that policymakers have different tools at their disposable -- disposal, excuse me, and better knowledge than they did back in 2020, and that widespread lockdowns are not as likely as they were in the past."

Michael and I were there a month ago and all our buildings are 95% occupied. Concessions are nearly nonexistent. And that's before the city. At the end of June, and it just reopened, and it wasn't very activated, to be honest, and the office population wasn't that high.

But paying promote does not have a terribly material impact on the yield even in a fairly successful deal.

It had a -- that's not 0, 20 basis points is real, but it -- when you think about the fact that EQR doesn't have to carry all that overhead doesn't have dead deal cost, doesn't have failed deal cost and could be expert capital allocators.

And I'll tell you, so far, we remain optimistic about the renewal performance for the remainder of the year. We just started in July and August to see the renewal quotes going out to folks that had previously come in with concessions. So about 17% of our offers for July and August went out to those folks that received a concession. And so far, the retention and ability to bring them up to market has played out. Now as we progress through September and into December, that number, 17% grows to about 25% of our offers will be to individuals that came in on a concession. 
So the strong demand that we have right now is really driving the confidence and in our ability to backfill at current rates. So while we don't want to drive the additional vacancy, we're going to work with residents and potentially stair step. If the demand remains as strong as it is, we will bring everybody up to market or we will have some increased turnover because we can replace those units at higher rates in a very short order of time. 
So the other thing I just want to call out is our residents are used to paying us that gross rent amount and the concessions that we granted were granted in usually the first or second full month of occupancy with us. So our challenge and our opportunity is really more around bringing them up to the gross street rents that you see today. 
And like I said, if the demand at the front door remains as strong as it is, we have a high degree of confidence because their options to go elsewhere in that market are going to be very limited because we're at market rates now."

But the primary thing that we look for in a new market is that renter. The knowledge-based industry renter who's got a resilient job growing income. And that -- those numbers are up dramatically in Atlanta and certainly in Austin, but also in Denver. And that comes then with these much more vibrant urban settings that they're choosing to live in and kind of foster and be part of. And that's a big part of why they stay in these neighborhoods longer than in the old days. And we had a much lower rents. We had much more turnover and single-family home prices were so much lower, particularly in the kind of neighborhoods that folks were living that our renter was using to live in that, that was a big source of competition, whereas today, in a market like Atlanta to find an affordable house, you have to go out really far. And a lot of people just don't want to make that trade-off when they've been living in Midtown or Midtown West or Buckhead. They're enjoying the life that they have, and they're just less likely to move out. And that's been a big change from the way it was when we were there 10, 15 years ago."

And that's a great question, now I'm just going to build on it, it's Mark. I mean, rents that we used to charge were $150 rents. And our situation when we exited those markets was our best renters could immediately afford to purchase a home, and our worst renters didn't pay us and left in the middle of the night. And it was a whole different demographic. And now this demographic is much more like a coastal demographic. They're well employed in financial technology, new media, other fields. They enjoy these urban amenities and these dense suburban amenities. 
They might want to buy a home, but home prices. And we spend a lot of time on this in Atlanta because average prices in Atlanta for the metro aren't very high for homes. They're about the national average. But in the areas near where the employment centers are people work, and the neighborhoods that Alex mentioned they want to live, it is quite high. Atlanta has got a lot of traffic. So if you want to move just like you can move in New York, you can move to [indiscernible], but it's a good distance where before in Atlanta, it wasn't much of a distance. 
So again, we got a lot of our folks siphoned. So we're looking at rents in the $2 to $2.5 a foot in these areas, double what it was before, a demographic that's got much higher incomes single-family situation that to us looks a lot better than it did when we left these markets a decade or a decade ago. 
And then again, that combines with the political risk that you and I and others have talked about on these calls for a long time. That's considerably more favorable than some of the other markets we're in."

Today, I'll give some brief remarks on our operating trajectory and investment activity, then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see the remainder of the year playing out, followed by Bob Garechana adding color on our guidance changes and balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions.
Also, as Marty mentioned, we are pleased to have Alec Brackenridge, EQR's Chief Investment Officer, available during the Q&A period. For those of you who do not know Alec, he's a 28-year veteran in this company. He literally started work here the day we went public in 1993 and took over as our CIO in 2020. As you can see from the release, he and his team have done exceptional work of late on the transactions side.
Turning to operations. All of our operating metrics continue to improve at a faster rate than we assumed earlier in the year. We are seeing demand levels well above 2019 in all our markets. And this has allowed us to continue growing occupancy, while at the same time raising rates. This resulted in the company materially raising annual same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO guidance. While our quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results remained negative, the decline was less than what we expected, and our sequential same-store revenue and NOI showed positive growth for the first time since the pandemic began.
As we have discussed on prior calls, improvement in our reported quarter-over-quarter same-store numbers will lag the recovery in our operating fundamentals as we work these now higher rents and lower concessions through our rent roll.
We believe that our business is set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022 as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes in our target demographic. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward.
On the investment side, we are active buyers and sellers in the second quarter and expect to continue being active capital recyclers. Consistent with what I've said on prior calls, we are allocating capital to places that are attractive to our affluent renter base, including the suburbs of our established coastal markets as well as Denver and our 2 new markets of Austin and Atlanta. We are making these trades with no dilution, even given higher pricing levels for the properties we are targeting because we are able to sell our older and less desirable properties at low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates.
Earlier this month, we reentered the Texas market after an 11-year absence by acquiring 2 well-located new assets in Austin, Texas. These properties are located in a desirable area with high housing costs that is equidistant between Downtown Austin and the Domain Hub on the north side. We acquired these 2 properties for $96 million, and approximately, a 3.9% cap rate and about $195,000 per unit. We expect to acquire a mix of urban and suburban assets in the Austin market.
During the second quarter and in July, we acquired 2 properties in Atlanta. SkyHouse South in Midtown for $115 million with a 3.6% cap rate. This is a deal we did previously disclose. And a few days ago, we acquired a second property in Atlanta in the bustling Midtown West neighborhood. We acquired this new property for $135 million, and it is about half occupied. And once it completes lease-up, we expect it will stabilize at a 4.1% cap rate.
We also continued adding to our Denver presence by purchasing an asset in the suburban Central Park area of Denver for $95 million. This property is located just west of the large and growing Fitzsimons medical campus and draws residents attracted to its access to abundant outdoor amenities. We expect this property, which is also in lease-up currently, to stabilize at a 4.2% cap rate.
We're also pleased to add to the portfolio of property each in the suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C. The Boston property is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and is a new asset that we acquired for $134.5 million at a 4.1% cap rate. This property is in a difficult-to-build suburb of Boston with high single-family housing costs and good access to high-paying jobs.
The D.C. asset is located in Fairfax, Virginia, and is a 2016 asset that we acquired for $70 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is well located with both good highway and good metro access and proximity to the growing job base in Northern Virginia. Both the Burlington and Fairfax assets are located in submarkets, where our existing assets have performed particularly well.
Year-to-date, we have bought $645 million of properties and expect to close on another $850 million in acquisitions, a good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation by the end of the year. We'll fund these buys with an approximately equivalent amount of dispositions, mostly from California of older and less desirable assets, which we sold or are under contract to sell at significantly above our pre-pandemic estimate of value.
Turning to development. We've put into service and began leasing our newly developed property in Alameda island, a short ferry ride to the city of San Francisco. Built on the side of a former naval base, this property has terrific views of the skyline and an evolving restaurant and bar scene that we think is attractive to our clientele.
Over the next few months, we'll complete our other 2 current development projects, including the Alcott in Central Boston, the largest development project in the company's history. Early leasing efforts on this project and our development project in Bethesda, Maryland, are going well. And our current estimates are that these 3 projects will stabilize at a development yield of approximately 5%, considerably higher than prevailing acquisition cap rates. These properties will be meaningful contributors to NFFO starting in late 2022.
We see development as a good complement to our acquisition activities as we spread more of our footprint to the suburbs of our established markets as well as to our new markets. We expect a significant amount of our development activity going forward to be done through joint venture arrangements. This allows us to leverage our partners in place sourcing and entitlement teams in locations like our new markets where we do not currently have a development presence.
Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during this particularly busy leasing season, and we're all very proud and grateful.
Go ahead, Michael."
28209,1672705410,2353180,"Equity Residential, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overa",1122,"Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends.
So first, we continue to see very good demand for our apartment homes. Our national call center in Ella, our AI leasing agent, are responding to record high levels of inbound interest for our apartments, which is converting into high volumes of self-guided tours. This overall level of demand continues to drive applications and move-in activity that is exceeding move-out, and ultimately, is delivering stronger-than-expected recovery in occupancy.
Portfolio-wide, physical occupancy is currently 96.5%, which is back to 2019 levels. San Francisco and Seattle are still trending slightly below 2019, and Southern California markets are slightly above. At this point, we expect to run the portfolio above 96% through the remainder of the third quarter. This strength in occupancy is allowing us to push rate and drive revenue growth.
Overall, we are more than halfway through the typical peak leasing season, and the momentum has been very strong, providing us the opportunity to raise rates, reduce concessions and grow occupancy. These fundamentals are delivering RV recovery.
From March to December of 2020, pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions, declined approximately $500 per unit. From January 2021 to today, pricing trend has grown $660, and is now not only above prior year levels in all markets but every market, except for San Francisco is also above 2019 peak pricing trend levels.
Today, the portfolio is approximately $100 higher per unit than our peak 2019 levels. Our priority has been to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. At the end of the first quarter, about 20% of applications were receiving on average 4 weeks in concessions.
As of July, we are now running with less than 3% of our applications receiving on average just over 2 weeks, and we expect this to continue to drop-off even further. To give you perspective, the total dollar of concessions granted peaked in the month of February at just north of $6 million for the same-store portfolio. For July, we will be at $1.5 million for the month, and August should be less than $750,000. Last week, only 12 properties had any concessions being offered.
The percent of residents renewing has stabilized around 55%, which is very much in line with historical averages but below the record high 60% levels that we had in 2019 and early 2020. As you saw in the press release, achieved renewal increase, new lease change and blended rate, all continued to improve in July, and we expect further improvement through the balance of the year as the comp period becomes more favorable and the business continues to strengthen. As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus will continue to be to push rates in our markets and manage our renewal negotiations.
In our management presentation, we provided color on all of our markets, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight New York and San Francisco as they tend to be the markets we receive the most questions about. Both markets are recovering nicely with concession use nearly nonexistent in our New York portfolio and declining rapidly in San Francisco.
New York is seeing stronger demand right now, and we think it is primarily due to greater clarity around employer return-to-office plans. New York employers, particularly the banks and financial firms have called their employees back to the office, and you could feel it in the economic activity in many areas of Manhattan. We see it in our portfolio after 9 consecutive weeks of record application volume.
In San Francisco, however, the return to office and reopening is a little more ambiguous. Employers have been slower to call employees back in, with many initially targeting after Labor Day. Adding to the uncertainty in San Francisco is the reintroduction of strong recommendations for indoor masking and some delays in reopening, which were announced last week. The situation in San Francisco is likely to lead to a delayed leasing season in that market and a slower full recovery of occupancy.
That said, occupancy is 95.4% today in San Francisco and is growing as is pricing trend. At this pace, we expect the San Francisco pricing trend to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are seeing some indicators that we could see an extended leasing season with a second wave of demand in New York, Boston and Seattle.
Our leasing teams in these markets have been dealing with prospects that are looking for move-in dates in late August and September and hearing from them that these moves are in connection with their need to be back in the office, or in the case of Boston, back on campus. This demand is more robust than historical patterns, which could suggest an extended peak leasing season in those markets, and matches up nicely with our lease expirations, which are more weighted towards the back of the year than usual.
Combining all of the data points I've just shared and those included in the management presentation, we see an unprecedented opportunity to grow sequential revenue over the next several quarters as the impact of better rates, nearly nonexistent concessions and higher occupancy compound. We acknowledge how badly our operations declined over the last 16 months, but the current recovery appears to be strong enough to both quickly recapture all that was lost in the pandemic and take us into a new period of strong operating fundamentals.
Finally, I want to take a minute and give you an update on the government assistance program for renters. As we've discussed on previous calls, approximately $50 billion in rental assistance for those impacted financially by the pandemic was made available in the various relief bills. We are laser-focused on accessing the rental relief funds and are working very closely with our eligible residents to apply for this relief.
Processing to date has been relatively slow in our markets, but we were able to recover approximately $5 million in the quarter. Bob will provide some color on our expectations for collections for the remainder of 2021 in his remarks.
Let me close by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. This pace of recovery would not be possible without them, and they remain relentless in taking care of each other and serving our customers.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob."

This morning, I'll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night's release, along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet and capital markets.As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway an",647,"Thanks, Michael. This morning, I'll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night's release, along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet and capital markets.
As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and is exceeding our prior expectations for the same-store portfolio. The continued strong operating momentum from this leasing season has led us to raise our annual same-store revenue guidance from negative 6% to negative 8% to negative 4% to negative 5%, an improvement at the midpoint of 250 basis points.
Strong expense controls and favorable real estate tax outcomes, which I will talk about in a moment, also allowed us to reduce our same-store expense guidance range to an increase of 2.75% to 3.25%, resulting in an NOI range of negative 7.5% to negative 8.5%, which is a 400 basis point improvement at the midpoint relative to our prior guidance.
Drivers of our revenue guidance increase of 250 basis points are roughly 150 basis points of improving operating fundamentals that Michael just outlined; 60 basis points or $15 million for the full year in related lower bad debt, primarily due to anticipated rental assistance collections; and the remaining 40 basis points is due to improved performance in our nonresidential business.
Before I move on to expenses, a quick comment on our bad debt assumptions. The back half of the year has about $10 million of additional assumed rental assistance collections on top of the $5 million we've already received. We feel very confident about this amount because we either received it in July, or after some real digging, can see that it is far along in the approval process.
There are other resident accounts being worked on, but they are not as far along. Given the lack of transparency and the relative slow processing speed to date, it is difficult to handicap how much will successfully get processed and whether we will receive these funds in 2021 or it will spill over into 2022.
On the expense side, we have also seen improvements versus prior expectations, which led us to center the midpoint of expense guidance at 3%, which was the low end of our prior guidance range. This reduction is in part due to the modest growth experienced in Q2 2021 even with a really challenging comparable period from Q2 of 2020. While some expense categories experienced a typically high percentage growth change quarter-over-quarter due to this comparability issue, overall expenses were less than originally anticipated.
Key categories driving the current period and anticipated full year lower were real estate taxes and payroll. Reduction in growth expectations for real estate taxes is primarily driven by lower than forecasted accessed values in some key markets.
Lower payroll growth expectations are primarily driven by our progress in optimizing staffing utilization as well as higher-than-usual staffing vacancies. We expect that 2021 will be our third consecutive year of low payroll growth, having delivered a 3-year average below 1%, while keeping other controllable expenses like repairs and maintenance in check. As a result of these same-store guidance changes, we raised the midpoint of our normalized FFO from $2.75 to $2.90.
A couple of closing comments on the balance sheet and debt capital markets. With the impact of the pandemic on our operations increasingly in the rearview mirror, it is clear that our balance sheet has held up remarkably well. Despite unprecedented pressure on operations, our credit metrics have remained well within our stated net debt-to-EBITDA leverage policy of between 5.5x to 6.5x.
The debt capital markets are also incredibly attractive at the moment for issuers like us. This creates opportunities to term out commercial paper with treasuries and credit spreads at or near record lows, the potential of which has been incorporated into our revised guidance range.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

So that's -- and it's almost entirely reserved against. So that's really the total pie of possibility if you think about it.
When you break it down kind of more granularly, we always run with $10 million, $11 million worth of receivable or bad debt. So it's probably a number that's a little bit below that. And again, so that leaves probably another $5 million to $10 million potential long run.
The really hard part, as I kind of mentioned in my remarks, is just the frequency and the process associated with this. So it's a pretty long process. Michael's team is all over it. We've gotten the best transparency we could, but it does require both the resident and us to match information to get it run through the process. And then it takes a while to, even after approved, have the cash kind of come through the door. And that's where the volatility arises in the numbers, which we wanted to highlight and be really clear about given what we have in guidance."

Some of those markets, Atlanta is a particularly large market, often are smaller markets. So there's different volumes there. So I'm going to kick it over to him to talk a little bit about how long it takes to kind of create a portfolio that makes sense in those markets. But I want to point out to you that it depends also on the saleability.
If we're able to continue to sell properties well, that will fuel the engine to buy properties well. So it depends both on transaction volume in those new markets that Alec will speak to and our ability to continue to dispose as we've very successfully done to date of properties at good prices in places like California, New York and D.C., where we're trying to lighten the load a bit."

If you have a second wave of demand coming into these markets, that is going to change the profile through the fourth quarter.
As you think about next year, we are doing some things now with some lease terms for the new leases we're writing. But again, we saw about a 5% shift, so we -- meaning, we have about a 5% more expirations in the back half of 2021 than we normally would have otherwise seen.
My guess is over the course of 2022, that clearly starts to mitigate back towards a normal pattern. But again, the strength of the fourth quarter this year could put us in a situation where we'll have more expirations in the fourth quarter of next year as well.

In any of our markets, right, when you think about the demographics coming in, and by that, I'm going to refer to not only the age of the new residents that moved in, in the quarter, but also the average household income for those residents.
So during the second quarter, our average age for move-ins was 30 -- just over 33 years old, slightly below the historical average for second quarters in previous years that was at 34, but pretty much right in line.
And when you think about the overall affordability index, I've said on previous calls, our range of rent as a percent of income between all of our markets goes between 17% at the low to 23% at the high. And as a portfolio for the move-ins that occurred in the second quarter, we were just over 19%. And that is very much in line with the historical averages for this portfolio.
So I think what you take away from that is our rents clearly have increased sequentially, but so have the average household incomes for the residents that have been moving in. So sequentially, we averaged at $152,000 was the average household income in the second quarter, that's up from just under $150,000 for move-ins in the first quarter.

So we are very open to portfolio transactions. We're open, for example, to OP unit, operating partnership unit, deals, which often end up being larger deals as well. But we just haven't seen a lot of that offered, and a lot of the portfolios we do see have some assets we like and a lot of assets we don't. So buying them one at a time gives us an advantage.

Cities are going to remain open. Things are going continue to progress, and our business will continue to improve.
I'm not as anxious about mask mandates, whether what the CDC did yesterday or some localities have done. I think to your point, we need to learn to manage this and live with this virus. As much as we all were hoping, it was just done and over. I think it's going to be part of our lives for an extended period of time.
On the good side, we've all sort of learned or many of us have learned how to live with it. And I think society will manage through it. I think if you do have widespread city closures, that could be a concern and would certainly be a derailer for us. I would say though that as you think about the way we've all learned about how lockdowns work, the mental health impact on people, the economic disarray that lockdowns closed these sort of citywide shutdowns, the deferral of other needed medical procedures, there's a lot of good reasons when -- especially when you have a vaccine that 60% of the population over 16% has taken at least one dose of. That seems like a more thoughtful way to proceed along with masks to us.
So we're not trying to whistle past the graveyard, or otherwise, ignore the delta variant.

And Denver is a little more urban than suburban, but has a big suburban component as well. So those markets have just really not been as affected and continue to progress right on straight through 2019 numbers. We think the leading indicators on coastal is what's going on in New York.
So with the city not even all the way opened a few months ago, we started a strong recovery. Now that recovery is in full swing, we see that recovery in San Francisco. Michael and I were there a month ago, and all our buildings are 95% occupied. Concessions are nearly nonexistent. And that's before the city at the end of June, and it just reopened, and it wasn't very activated, to be honest, and the office population wasn't that high.
So I would say to you that the leading indicators to us in the coastal markets are the coastal markets. I mean they are already recovering and doing very well. I think what you're going to see a year from now is that if things, again, continue to be supportive, the coastal markets will just keep going, like they were in late '19 or early '20, and that recovery from the pandemic is not the limit of the upside in those markets."

So as we said, we will continue to invest in the suburbs of our established markets, and one of them is actually an urban deal in one of those markets. So we'll certainly go through the details with you next quarter, but we are looking to replenish the pipeline. And in fact, we're hopeful there is -- there was a question earlier in the call, and I want to supplement the answer.
I mean, right now, there are -- most newer properties are going for some premium to replacement cost. So there is, in our mind, some reason to do more development as long as you're thoughtful about what your construction costs are, your execution risks, how you're funding it.

It had a -- that's not 0, 20 basis points is real, but it -- when you think about the fact that EQR doesn't have to carry all that overhead, doesn't have dead deal cost, doesn't have failed deal cost and could be expert capital allocators, I mean we all learned about some costs in business school, but it's still really hard to let go of a deal you've worked on.

And I'll tell you, so far, we remain optimistic about the renewal performance for the remainder of the year. We just started in July and August to see the renewal quotes going out to folks that had previously come in with concessions. So about 17% of our offers for July and August went out to those folks that received a concession.
And so far, the retention and ability to bring them up to market has played out. Now as we progress through September and into December, that number, 17% grows to about 25% of our offers, will be to individuals that came in on a concession.
So the strong demand that we have right now is really driving the confidence and in our ability to backfill at current rates. So while we don't want to drive the additional vacancy, we're going to work with residents, and potentially, stairstep. If the demand remains as strong as it is, we will bring everybody up to market, or we will have some increased turnover because we can replace those units at higher rates in a very short order of time.
So the other thing I just want to call out is our residents are used to paying us that gross rent amount, and the concessions that we granted were granted in usually the first or second full month of occupancy with us. So our challenge and our opportunity is really more around bringing them up to the gross street rents that you see today.
And like I said, if the demand at the front door remains as strong as it is, we have a high degree of confidence because their options to go elsewhere in that market are going to be very limited because we're at market rates now."

But the primary thing that we look for in a new market is that renter. The knowledge-based industry renter who's got a resilient job, growing income. And that -- those numbers are up dramatically in Atlanta, and certainly, in Austin, but also in Denver. And that comes then with these much more vibrant urban settings that they're choosing to live in and kind of foster and be part of. And that's a big part of why they stay in these neighborhoods longer than in the old days when we had a lot -- much lower rents. We had much more turnover. And single-family home prices were so much lower, particularly in the kind of neighborhoods that folks were living -- that our renter was choosing to live in that, that was a big source of competition.
Whereas, today, in a market like Atlanta to find an affordable house, you have to go out really far. And a lot of people just don't want to make that trade-off when they've been living in Midtown or Midtown West or Buckhead. They're enjoying the lives that they have, and they're just less likely to move out. And that's been a big change from the way it was when we were there 10, 15 years ago."

And our situation when we exited those markets was our best renters could immediately afford to purchase a home, and our worst renters didn't pay us and left in the middle of the night. And it was a whole different demographic.
And now this demographic is much more like a coastal demographic. They're well employed in financial, technology, new media, other fields. They enjoy these urban amenities and these dense suburban amenities.
They might want to buy a home, but home prices -- and we spend a lot of time on this in Atlanta because average prices in Atlanta for the metro aren't very high for homes. They're about the national average. But in the areas near where the employment centers are, people work, and the neighborhoods that Alec mentioned they want to live, it is quite high. Atlanta has got a lot of traffic. So if you want to move just like you can move in New York, you can move to your qualify, but it's a good distance wherein before in Atlanta, it wasn't much of a distance.
So again, we got a lot of our folks siphoned. So we're looking at rents in the $2 to $2.5 a foot in these areas, double what it was before, a demographic that's got much higher incomes. A single-family situation that to us looks a lot better than it did when we left these markets a decade or a decade ago.

I guess my question is, how much more fruit do you think there is less to shake from your existing relationships like, say, with Toll Brothers. You guys have a history of working together. It looks like you bought one of your Atlanta assets from them. They have a large development footprint in a lot of, let's call it, attractive markets. So they seem like an ideal partner.

Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and then we'll take your questions. 
We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company, and we are very pleased to report that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began. Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter, which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief payments made on behalf of our tenants. As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. 
We now expect our same-store revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of 2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the midpoint. All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation, you can find the building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market. We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic remains controlled. Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment. 
Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. 
This has caused the convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive climate for our strategic repositioning efforts. We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at prices that exceed our prepandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established markets at approximately equal cap rates. 
All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various [ stages ] of advanced negotiation already, all by year-end. We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our prepandemic estimates of value. Included in these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful. 
Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others. 
We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities. In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different partner and is not related to the Toll venture. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season, and we are all very proud and grateful. 
Go ahead, Michael."

The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying managemen",1521,"Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today, which is 60 basis points higher than 2019 and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. 
At this point, we expect to maintain strong occupancy through the balance of the year. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions, grew throughout the entire peak leasing season and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today, that same pricing trend has grown $637, which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered what we had lost in price. 
Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months is now being used on a very limited basis and in line with prepandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks. New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of traffic and applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have in the portfolio. 
Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large concessions and much lower rates this time last year. 
The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents in September and October is on track to be just below 65%, which is much better than the 55% historical norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at. 
At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations. Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year versus our more tenured residents. 
Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will continue watching very closely. Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rent that are significantly below current market prices. 
The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That, of course, does not mean that we will capture the full 13% in 2022, largely because leases expire throughout the year, not on January 1, and we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions which means the change is very dependent upon who actually moves out. 
Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible. Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022.  Remember, we have seen unprecedented demand even with only modest return to office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong. Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. 
We are currently running above 96.5% and would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022. And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive. 
Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter. Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal seasonality. 
On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall demand levels but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are 96.5% and  should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans. 
Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early next year. 
Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line. We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market but have been successful in mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing agent named Ella. 
On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the experience and service that our customers require which is evident by the all-time high online reputation Google rating of 4.2, all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer experience that our residents require. 
Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted, we have continued to work with them, including assisting them and applying for rent relief. We have received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year. Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring, our goal will be to continue working with residents to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021.

So a normal, and I'll say, a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us have consisted of 2 years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or so where same-store revenue growth was right around 0, slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a transition year. And in a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue growth numbers for high 4s, those kinds of things. 
Given the earn-in, given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year, and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that 0 and head right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers, that's subject to some regulatory [ flak ] here and there, we're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023. 
And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents, giving them great service. So hopefully, that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of next year's same-store revenue number."

In terms of the compounding, the compounding is going to start with the operations, with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. Look at '22 when we've given you some color. And certainly, it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is likely to pick up in '24, our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. 
And that will always be the big engine at EQR. Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets, especially in these newer markets, these suburban markets. So -- and we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5% on current rents and all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt, net cash flow, which we'll have more of starting next year and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter."

I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing guidance yet, but maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John. 
So you think about the big 4 categories, real estate taxes, we've had a good amount of success. That's 40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton of pressure from the municipalities, and I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into 2022, right? So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run rate, inclusive of 421as and other things. 
On the payroll side, we've done an excellent, excellent job, I think, of managing what has been an inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is experiencing, which is payroll pressure, and we've been really good at it thus far, and I don't think there's anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. 
We're just doing things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure. The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities, I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside of like the payroll side. Utilities are -- a big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what nat gas has done kind of recently, and that's the one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, I don't think that 2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time."

So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, so far, the deal-seeking residents that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have concessions.

Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project sites too dense.  So that maybe you go to a structured parking, which is more expensive, where you go underground, which is yet more expensive, on top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the other -- the typical yield parameters that we assess."

So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco, that submarket at 4,000 new units being delivered, it continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited concessions like in the stabilized portfolio. 
And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, on the concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the call that the overall level of competitiveness against our portfolio was expected to be less. 
When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022. So relative to this proximity of within 1 and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us."

And so we're going to get a break -- more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing. D.C. will kind of continue doing what DC does and deliver a lot, but we're going to feel a lot better about places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good setup. When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community hasn't not seen the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. 
And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand -- or excuse me, a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out. The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty good to us on supply. Dallas has supply, but it's spread out and it's a big demand market. So I guess that's the color we'd give you. Denver has a lot of supply [indiscernible] more downtown than otherwise. But Again, we have a portfolio we're building that in Denver will be a pretty diversified portfolio when we're done."

In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. 
I think the numbers [ early ] have to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur. But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number because as Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does this accounting work and roll those numbers up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it was in 2019. 
So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be merely very strong late in the year.

And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our typical development spending needs the last 3, 4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. 
And here, I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized. Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion [ or ] $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023, we have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash flow, and we expect to have that again next year and hopefully in some good abundance, incremental debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we will. I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development expectations for the company in the next few years."

[ That ] good cause eviction is just rent control by another name. It's bad policy. New York said rent control, you know you live there for -- since World War II and the housing situation in New York has not improved. This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. 
And there's a lot of better ideas like SP9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in Minneapolis that should have been thought about. So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going, and we'll work through our association to suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. 
It doesn't make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure and in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's a negative to investment in the city and in the state. In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their property taxes low if they can raise them. 
So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex, to kind of reimburses for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load New York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital for housing in New York."

And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture some of that rate. 
When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay.

Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices and New York is the highest with 21% loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market. 
And as I stated in my prepared remarks, the loss to lease is a snapshot of today, and it never has translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations. And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has ever been in for the ability to capture it. But I think you need several months into next year to really understand how you're going to translate that into revenue growth and how much of that is going to roll into 2023.

And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the space because of the performance matters you mentioned because though there were significant declines in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option that no other sector has. So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition, whatever the 10-year spot treasury rate was.  Right near the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close to that 3.7%. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. And so I think -- I don't feel like we're that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking, when we look at the whole sort of situation, it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding [indiscernible] you're seeing."

That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's continued to edge up.

So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail. 
On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting us. 
And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this, a lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets. So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are good leverage buys.

Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity, then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and then we'll take your questions.  
We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company, and we are very pleased to report that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began. 
Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter, which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief payments made on behalf of our tenants. 
As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. We now expect our same-store revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of 2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the midpoint. 
All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation, you can find the building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market. 
We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic remains controlled. 
Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment.  
Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. 
Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. This has caused the convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive climate for our strategic repositioning efforts. 
We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established markets at approximately equal cap rates.  
All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions, mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation already, all by year-end. 
We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our pre-pandemic estimates of value. Included in these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful.  
Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others.  
We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities. In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different partner and is not related to the Toll venture.  
Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season, and we are all very proud and grateful.  
Go ahead, Michael."
28209,1684382892,2414552,"Equity Residential, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Equity Residential","Executives","Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying managemen",1519,"Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today, which is 60 basis points higher than 2019 and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. At this point, we expect to maintain strong occupancy through the balance of the year. 
Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions, grew throughout the entire peak leasing season and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today, that same pricing trend has grown $637, which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered what we had lost in price.  
Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months, is now being used on a very limited basis and in line with pre-pandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks. 
New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of traffic in applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have in the portfolio.  
Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large concessions and much lower rates this time last year.  
The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents in September, and October is on track to be just below 65%, which is much better than the 55% historical norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at.  
At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations. Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year versus our more tenured residents. Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will continue watching very closely. 
Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rents that are significantly below current market prices.  
The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That, of course, does not mean that we will capture the full 13% in 2022, largely because leases expire throughout the year, not on January 1, and we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions, which means the change is very dependent upon who actually moves out. Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible.
Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022.  Remember, we have seen unprecedented demand even with only modest return-to-office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong. 
Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. We are currently running above 96.5% and would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022. 
And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive.  
Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter. Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal seasonality. 
On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall demand levels, but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are 96.5% and should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans.  
Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early next year.  
Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line. 
We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market, but have been successful in mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing agent named Ella.  
On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the experience and service that our customers require, which is evident by the all-time high online reputation Google rating of 4.2, all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer experience that our residents require.  
Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted, we have continued to work with them, including assisting them in applying for rent relief. We have received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year. 
Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring, our goal will be to continue working with residents to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021.

We're not giving '22 guidance, but as you said, we did try to lay out how we're thinking about things, what the building blocks are, what the team is trying to figure out as we look towards '22. When we made the comment both in the release and in my prepared remarks that it's setting up to be the best year in the company's history, I want to -- for same-store revenue growth, I do want to give a little context. 
So a normal, and I'll say, a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us, have consisted of 2 years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or so where same-store revenue growth was right around 0, slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a transition year. And then a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue growth numbers for high 4s, those kinds of things.  
Given the earn-in, given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year, and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that 0 and head right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers, that's subject to some regulatory flak here and there, we're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023.  
And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents, giving them great service. So hopefully, that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of next year's same-store revenue number."

In terms of the compounding, the compounding is going to start with the operations, with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. If you look at '22 when we've given you some color. And certainly, it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is likely to pick up in '24, our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. And that will always be the big engine at EQR. 
Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets, especially in these newer markets, these suburban markets. So -- and we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5% on current rents and all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt; net cash flow, which we'll have more of starting next year; and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter."

I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing guidance yet, but maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John.  
So if you think about the big 4 categories, real estate taxes, we've had a good amount of success. That's 40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton of pressure from the municipalities, and I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into 2022, right? So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run rate, inclusive of 421as and other things. 
On the payroll side, we've done an excellent, excellent job, I think, of managing what has been an inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is experiencing, which is payroll pressure, and we've been really good at it thus far, and I don't think there's anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. We're just doing things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure. 
The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities, I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside of like the payroll side. Utilities are -- a big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what nat gas has done kind of recently, and that's the one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, and I don't think that 2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time."

So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, so far, the deal-seeking residents that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have concessions.

Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project -- the site is too dense. So then maybe you go to a structured parking, which is more expensive, or you go underground, which is yet more expensive, on top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the other -- the typical yield parameters that we assess."

So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco, that submarket at 4,000 new units being delivered, it continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited concessions like in the stabilized portfolio. 
And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, on the concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the calls that the overall level of competitiveness against our portfolio was expected to be less.  
When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022, so relative to this proximity of within 1 and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us."

We told you sort of what we know, Jeff, which is this sort of earn-in, this loss to lease. We gave you, I think, some pretty specific parameters on where things like bad debt might be able to go. And then the big mysteries really are regulatory pressures, how the intra-period growth feels next year. And then where we end this year?

And that's really as a result of delays in starts or delays in completions of product that was underway during the pandemic. And so we're going to get a break -- more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing. D.C. will kind of continue doing what D.C. does and deliver a lot, but we're going to feel a lot better about places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good setup. 
When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community has not seen the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand -- or excuse me, a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out. 
The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty good to us on supply.

So assuming you agree with that, won't it be true that as things settle and you kind of have this -- all this stuff be a wash in terms of year-over-year comps, that the cadence of 2022 would be super strong year-over-year growth in the first half but a return to earth in the second half.

In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. I think the numbers early have to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur. But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number because as Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does his accounting work and roll those numbers up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it was in 2019.  
So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be merely very strong late in the year. But I think what you're going to see besides those operating statistics, Rich, is that quarterly normalized FFO number get better, I think, every quarter of next year."

And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our typical development spending needs the last 3, 4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. And here, I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized. 
Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion to $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023, we have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash flow, and we expect to have that again next year and hopefully in some good abundance, incremental debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we will -- I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development expectations for the company in the next few years."

Does good cause eviction is just rent control by another name? It's bad policy. New York has had rent control, and you know, you live there for -- since World War II and the housing situation in New York has not improved. This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. And there's a lot of better ideas like SB 9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in Minneapolis that should have been thought about. 
So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going, and we'll work through our association to suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. It doesn't make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure. And in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's a negative to investment in the city and in the state. 
In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their property taxes low if they can raise them. So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex, to kind of reimburse us for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load in New York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital for housing in New York."

So just a little bit more clarity, probably bring some incremental demand, and that most likely will happen after we get into the New Year. And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture some of that rate.  
When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay, we thought we were going to have pressure in the South Bay because of the new supply being delivered. We're really holding up really well there. Now the rate hasn't fully recovered, but the rate recovery in the South Bay is better than the rate recovery in Downtown San Francisco.

Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices, and New York is the highest with 21% loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market.  
And as I stated in my prepared remarks, the loss to lease is a snapshot of today, and it never has translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations. And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has ever been in for the ability to capture it.

But we're underwriting these deals and generally for Toll to bring them to us as we've said they need to be in that 5% yield range on current rents or better. And so right now, Alec and his team are buying at a 3.5% or so cap rate on existing assets. So that's at 3.5% to 5% difference, that 150 basis points or so of margin that, again, we think is compensating us for the risk. So when we buy the asset, we will be paying Toll of promote presumably. And so we'll be buying it at a slightly lower cap rate than that 5% in my example, assuming no intra-period rent growth. But again, because of the way the promote is structured and all of that, it's not that meaningful a difference. I mean we're 75% of the capital in the deal or the equity capital in the deal. So is that helpful to you?"

And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the space because of the performance matters you mentioned because though there were significant declines in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option that no other sector has. 
So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition, whatever the 10-year spot treasury rate was. Right near the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close to that 3.7%. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. And so I think -- I don't feel like we're that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking, when we look at the whole sort of situation, it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding trends you're seeing."

That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's continued to edge up. So there are some participants who have kind of stepped back and said, ""Well, I'm not going to win anyway. So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail. 
On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting us.  
And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this, a lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets. So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are good leverage buys. So that's one of the other thing that continues to force capital into our space."

I mean in our -- as maybe in Atlanta, they wouldn't be bounded by that. 
Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, for example, in Texas, there's a whole bunch of property tax limitations that are coming into place on both commercial real estate, residential real estate. Alec and his team underwrite these increases. So if cash flow isn't going up net-net, then those assets aren't going to be appealing to us. 
So I'm not sure what you said is certain because when you say same-store expenses, maybe property taxes go up more, but I'll tell you, California minimum wage is a lot higher. California -- all the other compliance costs that go with owning in California are much higher. So I think if you're talking about holistic same-store expenses, I'm not sure I believe, at least for the first 10 years or so of owning a California asset that there's going to be that much of a difference in same-store expense growth.

I'm going to start and if Bob or Michael have anything, they'll add. But I'm on 12 -- Page 12 of our press release, we give you a bunch of disclosure about residential bad debt and maybe this will bound this up for you.  
In 2019, our write-offs, so that would be a direct negative against residential revenues were about 40 basis points. That's a good run rate of delinquency in our portfolio rents we never receive and that burden same-store revenue. When you look at what happened last year in '20, where there were no recoveries and the pandemic was 3 quarters of the year and this year, you see on the bottom of 12, we're talking about numbers that are in the 2%, 2.5% range is a headwind. 
Now the problem we're having is forecasting for you where between 40 basis points and 2.5% does next year fall. And that depends on how quickly the courts process evictions; our success in continuing to work with our residents, which is always our first goal; whether government revenue -- or government rent relief programs kind of leak, Robert, into next year or mostly are covered this year. So that -- hopefully, that gives you a boundary, but that's what we have to be a little general about because there just isn't certainty in our mind and across so many court systems and so many jurisdictions for us to know how all that stuff plays out."
