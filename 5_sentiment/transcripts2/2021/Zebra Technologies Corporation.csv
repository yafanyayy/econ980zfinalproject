I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during the pandemic. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. Each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook. 
We generated more business in Q4 than any other quarter in our history. Our teams executed well to satisfy a faster than expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions. Demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on demand economy. We also drove improved profitability and cash flow while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
Our record Q4 results capped a challenging full year 2020, in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. However, we did achieve record free cash flow of $895 million for the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2021 outlook."

In Q4, we returned to profitable growth after a particularly challenging first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. Our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre pandemic levels, driven by a recovery of our run rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking Segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. 
Our Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions. We also realized strong growth in services and software, driven by our managed and support services and Zebra Retail Solutions. From a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in North America and significant growth in EMEA while Asia Pac and Latin America were slower to recover. In North America, sales increased 6%, printing, supplies, data capture and services were bright spots. In EMEA, sales increased 20%, printing, supplies, mobile computing and services grew double digits as we saw strong demand through our partner distribution channel. APAC sales were down 4% year-over-year, yet increased sequentially, printing and mobile computing were bright spots, and we saw modest growth in China. Latin America sales declined 15%, with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. Adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8%, driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of China import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin. Business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. We continue to diligently manage costs while accelerating high-return investments in the business. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. This was $271 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100%, primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. Lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes and interest also contributed to the improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our target maximum of 2.5x. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the new year with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021. In Q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. This outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. For the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14%, with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery. This outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year. 
We expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year. We do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in our end markets."

We have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. We continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations and innovation to drive sustainable growth. In 2020, we acquired Reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position. Slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. We are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' complex operational challenges. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real-time actionable insights. The result is a more intelligent enterprise, with optimized workflows. 
Through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. Retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. If goods are not delivered or made available for pickup, as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. To address this issue, retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency. We are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point-of-sale systems, RFID and other intelligent automation solutions. 
All of which are critical to digitizing their operations. Key benefits to the retailer include: better operational visibility and insights, increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real-time actionable information and more satisfied customers. Last month, we participated in the National Retail Federation's virtual sessions, where we showcased how Zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. At one of the sessions, AutoZone explained how our Reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting. We are proud to enable AutoZone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets. As I mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. In Q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers. In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes while last mile on-demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. The Italian Post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. Separately, the deployment of our TC 7 Series mobile computers to United States postal service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late Q1 with a goal of completion in Q3. In health care, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care, our highest growth end market opportunity. In Q4, we grew our relationship with one of America's leading health care providers. New acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. The most recent use case we addressed was COVID drive-through testing with our health care purposed TC 5 Series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system. 
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. We see vibrant opportunity to increase automation in workflows, and we are viewed as a visionary in this market. In Q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. This included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in North America. This customer initiated a multiyear rollout of our ET5 Series tablets, accessories and related services, for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors. Another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the United States. Using our TC 7 Series mobile computers, along with ZQ5 Series mobile printers, they implemented an automated parking citation application that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months. 
In closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. We are well positioned for ongoing success as the need to digitize and automate workflows continues to accelerate. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

First, I'd say that across all the verticals that we play in, we are uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers to  perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where COVID-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. So each of our 4 primary verticals had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021. And we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks. 
Now specifically for retail and e-commerce, I said we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel and e-commerce as part of the early phase of COVID. If you look at in the store, buy online, pick up at store and other delivery use cases, we're growing very rapidly. And in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them are also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. And we're starting to see pilots for our Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions starting to resume. Another trend that we see in retail is around equipping all associates with a device. That's also very synergistic with our Reflexis workforce and task management solutions where they work very much hand-in-hand. And the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad-based. It includes retail. Also, e-commerce is probably a little less of smaller companies. There's more large businesses. But the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw especially expand across the 4 verticals that we work in."

We do expect premium freight costs to persist around $30 million to $40 million, yet declining in the second half as air travel returns. And within the full year guide, we do expect OpEx to increase as a percent of sales once you include a full year of Reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post COVID, including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. 
I also think it's worth noting when you look at the full year EBITDA guide, Reflexis, as we stated, is going to be dollar neutral year, yet slightly dilutive given the investments in go-to-market and the platform. Then we do expect that to scale over time. On your second question, if you look at free cash flow, $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance, particularly in AR. We saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our Q4 sales were front-loaded, driving some of the benefit. As well as small incremental AR factoring, lower taxes, interest expense and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. 
So we look at -- for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just the exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing, the free cash flow conversion rate over the 2-year period."

We did benefit from a recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. There's 3 trends that I think are worth highlighting. The Android transition is one of those, but I'll start with new use cases. We talked earlier about the second trend, which was around -- worth putting a device in the hand of every worker. But the use cases has probably been the biggest driver. Think about omnichannel and retail. Health care is a newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. And then the third trend around the Android transition. We still have lots of momentum around the Android transition 
and a lot of opportunity left in that. We have -- our market share in Android is still around 60%, but Android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. We've often talked about the transition from -- transitioning older legacy Windows devices to Android. But today, I think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older Android devices is actually bigger. Our estimate is that they're now low double-digit millions of Android devices in the market with a somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old Windows devices used to have. And we expect that there's about a high single-digit million Windows devices out there. So it's more of a balance perspective, and we certainly like to get both of those.

In 2021, we expect that, that mix will return closer to normal, and therefore, simply because of the mix effect, we think that the average price points would normalize as well as a result of that, right? That  is an effect."

We had, obviously great growth in both printing and supplies, both printing and supplies were up double digits in the quarter. Our printing business is up across the portfolio.

We had, obviously great growth in both printing and supplies, both printing and supplies were up double digits in the quarter. Our printing business is up across the portfolio. We did, I think, benefit from some pent-up demand, particularly in EMEA. Remember, EMEA also was hit harder early on in the pandemic. So there was probably a little bit more of a rebound to be had there. I'd also say, though, that we have, early in 2020, we took a number of actions to strengthen our go-to-market and strengthen our channel ecosystem, particularly around printing. And I think that is now bearing fruit for us also. So we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing specifically. But we did see our business through -- or our smaller business, small and midsize business recover quite nicely. We recovered faster than we had expected. I think it's fair to say in Q4. Manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical. We have a strong vertical for printing generally but lighter over the last year, but that was also coming back and strengthening. And RFID was actually a very strong quarter for printing. I think it was a record quarter for Print RFID. 
And then on supplies, we did see a strong performance in supplies, particularly in North America. And Temptime also had a strong fourth quarter. Overall, though, I'd say that we have a very strong portfolio of smart and connected printers that have an unrivaled manageability through our link OS operating system, and that is a true differentiator in the market."

The sales to our larger companies, larger customers, that we talked about an earlier question, remained strong. And they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel, as an example. And I'd say our larger customers who are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic to align with how consumers wanted to behave how the economy was working at that point while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it. 
But I think now we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete. Competing in the same way they did prior to COVID is not necessarily going to be a successful formula. And I think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic, and we've been able to gain share. Our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes. And I think we were able to do that well and see some opportunities that way. So we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand, you can say, which helped us in Q4, and I expect it to help us in Q1 here also.

I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during the pandemic. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. 
For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. Each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook. 
We generated more business in Q4 than any other quarter in our history. Our teams executed well to satisfy a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions. Demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. 
We also drove improved profitability and cash flow, while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our record Q4 results capped a challenging full year 2020, in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. However, we did achieve record free cash flow of $895 million for the year.

In Q4, we returned to profitable growth after a particularly challenging first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. Our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre-pandemic levels, driven by a recovery of our run rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand. 
Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand, with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions. We also realized strong growth in services and software, driven by our managed and support services and Zebra retail solutions. 
From a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in North America and significant growth in EMEA, while Asia Pac and Latin America were slower to recover. In North America, sales increased 6%. Printing, supplies, data capture and services were bright spots. In EMEA, sales increased 20%. Printing, supplies, mobile computing and services grew double digits as we saw strong demand through our partner distribution channel. 
APAC sales were down 4% year-over-year, yet increased sequentially. Printing and mobile computing were bright spots, and we saw modest growth in China. Latin America sales declined 15%, with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8%, driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of China import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin. Business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. We continue to diligently manage costs, while accelerating high-return investments in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. This was $271 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100%, primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. 
Lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes and interest also contributed to the improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our target maximum of 2.5x. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the new year with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
In Q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. This outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. 
For the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14%, with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery. This outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year. 
We expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year. We do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in our end markets."

We have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. We continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations and innovation to drive sustainable growth. In 2020, we acquired Reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position. 
Slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. We are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' complex operational challenges. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real-time actionable insights. The result is a more intelligent enterprise, with optimized workflows. 
Through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. Retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. If goods are not delivered or made available for pickup, as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. To address this issue, retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency. 
We are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point-of-sale systems, RFID and other intelligent automation solutions, all of which are critical to digitizing their operations. Key benefits to the retailer include: better operational visibility and insights; increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real-time actionable information, and more satisfied customers. 
Last month, we participated in the National Retail Federation's virtual sessions, where we showcased how Zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. At one of the sessions, AutoZone explained how our Reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting. We are proud to enable AutoZone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets. As I mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. 
In Q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers. In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes, while last-mile on-demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. 
The Italian Post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. Separately, the deployment of our TC7 Series mobile computers to United States Postal Service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late Q1, with a goal of completion in Q3. In health care, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care, our highest-growth end market opportunity. 
In Q4, we grew our relationship with one of America's leading health care providers. New acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. The most recent use case we addressed was COVID drive-through testing with our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system. 
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. We see vibrant opportunity to increase automation in workflows, and we are viewed as a visionary in this market. 
In Q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. This included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in North America. This customer initiated a multiyear rollout of our ET5 Series tablets, accessories and related services for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors. 
Another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the United States. Using our TC7 Series mobile computers, along with ZQ5 Series mobile printers, they implemented an automated parking citation application that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months. 
In closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. We are well positioned for ongoing success as the need to digitize and automate workflows continues to accelerate. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

First, I'd say that across all the verticals that we play in, we are uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers to perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where COVID-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. So each of our 4 primary verticals had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021, and we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks. 
Now specifically for retail and e-commerce, I said we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel and e-commerce as part of the early phase of COVID. If you look at in-the-store, buy-online, pick-up-at-store and other delivery use cases, we're growing very rapidly. And in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them are also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. 
And we're starting to see pilots for our Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions starting to resume. Another trend that we see in retail is around equipping all associates with a device. That's also very synergistic with our Reflexis workforce and task management solutions, where they work very much hand-in-hand. 
And the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad-based. It includes retail. Also, e-commerce is probably a little less of smaller companies, there's more large businesses. But the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw especially expand across the 4 verticals that we work in."

Whereas small and medium-sized customers paused their spending and were a bit cautious. In particular, outside of the U.S., we saw this phenomenon. 
But we also learned that the solutions that we have, in particular on the printing and scanning side, are essential to these customers. And they ultimately need to come back and refresh those. And that is driving a lot of the pent-up demand that we were seeing in Q4 as they returned to make those essential purchases."

And within the full year guide, we do expect OpEx to increase as a percent of sales once you include a full year of Reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post-COVID, including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. I also think it's worth noting when you look at the full year EBITDA guide, Reflexis, as we stated, is going to be a dollar-neutral year, yet slightly dilutive given the investments in go-to-market and the platform. Then we do expect that to scale over time. 
On your second question, if you look at free cash flow, $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance, particularly in AR. We saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our Q4 sales were front-loaded, driving some of the benefit. As well as small incremental AR factoring, lower taxes, interest expense and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. So when we look at -- for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just the exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing the free cash flow conversion rate over the 2-year period."

I think, as you mentioned, scaling some of the newer markets with richer gross margin, Reflexis being one of those proof points. 
We always continue to focus on driving higher gross margin and productivity through all of our operational efficiencies across the business. And we've had a track record of doing that and driving profitable growth. And we do expect EBITDA margins to get back to the pre-pandemic levels in '21, and we really don't see any reason that, that should be constrained as we move forward in terms of continued expansion."

I'd say, first, maybe think about the business around our core near adjacencies and around the Enterprise Asset Intelligence or Intelligent Edge Solutions, so more the newer stuff. I do believe that our core business, AIT printing and scanning side, including services, are very healthy, good shape, and I expect them to continue to grow at a nice rate over the longer term. 
I don't expect printing to kind of break out from the pack here. Printing has been a bit more up and down over the last year. So we have probably a little bit more of a pent-up demand in printing solutions than we had in some of the other solutions. 
But if you look into our -- the Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision that we have in the Intelligent Edge Solutions, I do expect our software assets and some of our more intelligent automation solutions to grow faster than the company average from a gross margin perspective and, obviously, scale will help us here. But also as we invest in some of the newer solutions, we will -- there will be a kind of investment phase first, and then we will see margins expanding, we believe, quite nicely once revenue is starting to grow.

We did benefit from a recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. There's 3 trends that I think are worth highlighting. The Android transition is one of those, but I'll start with new use cases. 
We talked earlier about the second trend, which was around -- worth putting a device in the hand of every worker. But the use cases that's probably been the biggest driver, think about the omnichannel and retail. Health care is a newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. And then the third trend around the Android transition. We still have lots of momentum around the Android transition and a lot of opportunity left in that. 
We have -- our market share in Android is still around 60%, but Android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. We've often talked about the transition from -- transitioning older legacy Windows devices to Android. But today, I think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older Android devices is actually bigger. 
Our estimate is that they're now low double-digit millions of Android devices in the market with a somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old Windows devices used to have, and which we expect that there's about a high single-digit million Windows devices out there. So it's more of a balanced perspective, and we certainly like to get both of those. And -- but Android has been a great catalyst for growth for us."

And I think that is now bearing fruit for us also. So we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing, specifically. 
But we did see our business through -- or our smaller business -- small and mid-sized business recover quite nicely. We recovered faster than we had expected. I think it's fair to say, in Q4, manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical. We have a much -- strong vertical for printing, generally, but lighter over the last year, but that was also coming back and strengthening. And RFID was actually a very strong quarter for printing.

But I'd say that, starting with our products and solutions, are now mission-critical for our enterprise customers, and they need that to compete effectively in their on-demand economy. The sales to our larger companies, larger customers that we talked about in an earlier question, remained strong. 
And they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel, as an example. And I'd say our larger customers who are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic, to align with how consumers wanted to behave how the economy was working at that point, while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it. 
But I think, now, we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete. Competing in the same way they did prior to COVID is not necessarily going to be a successful formula. And I think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic, and we've been able to gain share. Our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes, and I think we were able to do that well and seize some opportunities that way. 
So we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand, you can say, which helped us in Q4, and I expect it to help us in Q1 here also. But more broadly, though, as we look forward, we are very excited about the business overall and the growth prospects that we have not just in Q4, Q1, but the longer term, based on our ability to help our customers digitize and automate their businesses."

I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers critical needs during the pandemic. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. 
For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. Each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook.  
We generated more business in Q4 than any other quarter in our history. Our teams executed well to satisfy a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions. Demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. 
We also drove improved profitability and cash flow, while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our record Q4 results capped a challenging full year 2020, in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. However, we did achieve record free cash flow of $895 million for the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2021 outlook."

In Q4, we returned to profitable growth after a particularly challenging first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. Our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre-pandemic levels, driven by a recovery of our run-rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand. 
Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand, with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions. We also realized strong growth in services and software, driven by our managed and support services and Zebra retail solutions. 
From a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in North America and significant growth in EMEA, while Asia Pac and Latin America were slower to recover. In North America, sales increased 6%. Printing, supplies, data capture and services were bright spots. In EMEA, sales increased 20%. Printing, supplies, mobile computing and services grew double-digits as we saw strong demand through our partner distribution channel. 
APAC sales were down 4% year-over-year, yet increased sequentially. Printing and mobile computing were bright spots, and we saw modest growth in China. Latin America sales declined 15%, with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8%, driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of China import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin. Business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. We continue to diligently manage costs, while accelerating high-return investments in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase.  
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. This was $271 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100%, primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. 
Lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes and interest also contributed to the improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our target maximum of 2.5x.  
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the new year with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
In Q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. This outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. 
For the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14%, with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery. This outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year.  
We expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year. We do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in our end markets."

We have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. We continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations and innovation to drive sustainable growth. In 2020, we acquired Reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position. 
Slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. We are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' complex operational challenges. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real-time actionable insights. The result is a more intelligent enterprise, with optimized workflows.  
Through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. Retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. If goods are not delivered or made available for pickup, as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. To address this issue, retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency. 
We are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point-of-sale systems, RFID and other intelligent automation solutions, all of which are critical to digitizing their operations. Key benefits to the retailer include: better operational visibility and insights; increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real-time actionable information, and more satisfied customers. 
Last month, we participated in the National Retail Federation's virtual sessions, where we showcased how Zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. At one of the sessions, AutoZone explained how our Reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting. We are proud to enable AutoZone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers.  
Now turning to Slide 12. We continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets. As I mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. 
In Q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers. In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes, while last-mile on-demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. 
The Italian Post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. Separately, the deployment of our TC7 Series mobile computers to United States Postal Service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late Q1, with a goal of completion in Q3. In health care, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care, our highest-growth end market opportunity. 
In Q4, we grew our relationship with one of America's leading health care providers. New acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. The most recent use case we addressed was COVID drive-through testing with our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system.  
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. We see vibrant opportunity to increase automation in workflows, and we are viewed as a visionary in this market. 
In Q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. This included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in North America. This customer initiated a multiyear rollout of our ET5 Series tablets, accessories and related services for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors. 
Another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the United States. Using our TC7 Series mobile computers, along with ZQ5 Series mobile printers, they implemented an automated parking citation application that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months.  
In closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. We are well-positioned for ongoing success as the need to digitize and automate workflows continues to accelerate.  
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

First, I'd say that across all the verticals that we play in, we are uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers to perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where COVID-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. So each of our 4 primary verticals had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021, and we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks.  
Now specifically for retail and e-commerce, I said we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel and e-commerce as part of the early phase of COVID. If you look at in-the-store, buy-online, pick-up-at-store and other delivery use-cases, we're growing very rapidly. And in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them are also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. 
And we're starting to see pilots for our Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions starting to resume. Another trend that we see in retail is around equipping all associates with a device. That's also very synergistic with our Reflexis workforce and task management solutions, where they work very much hand-in-hand. 
And the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad-based. It includes retail. Also, e-commerce is probably a little less of smaller companies, there's more large businesses. But the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw especially expand across the 4 verticals that we work in."

Whereas small and medium-sized customers paused their spending and were a bit cautious. In particular, outside of the U.S., we saw this phenomenon. 
But we also learned that the solutions that we have, in particular on the printing and scanning side, are essential to these customers. And they ultimately need to come back and refresh those. And that is driving a lot of the pent-up demand that we were seeing in Q4 as they returned to make those essential purchases."

We expect gross margin to improve year-on-year, primarily due to the order size mix normalizing, which we saw in Q4 and implied in our Q1 guide. We do expect premium freight costs to persist around $30 million to $40 million, yet declining in the second half as air travel returns. 
And within the full year guide, we do expect OpEx to increase as a percent of sales once you include a full year of Reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post-COVID, including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. I also think it's worth noting when you look at the full year EBITDA guide, Reflexis, as we stated, is going to be a dollar-neutral year, yet slightly dilutive given the investments in go-to-market and the platform. Then we do expect that to scale over time. 
On your second question, if you look at free cash flow, $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance, particularly in AR. We saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our Q4 sales were front-loaded, driving some of the benefit. As well as small incremental AR factoring, lower taxes, interest expense and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. So when we look at -- for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just the exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing the free cash flow conversion rate over the 2-year period."

The Xplore acquisition, where Xplore has a strong market, the rugged tablets are a strong product offering into those markets, has been instrumental in leading us there. 
But it also has been something we've been pursuing for some time, but it does take some time to build up the channel infrastructure as well as fine-tune the product offering and hire the appropriate type of dedicated and expert sales reps who can operate in those verticals. And we feel we now have that in place, and it's beginning to pay off."

We did benefit from a recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. There's 3 trends that I think are worth highlighting. The Android transition is one of those, but I'll start with new use cases. 
We talked earlier about the second trend, which was around -- worth putting a device in the hand of every worker. But the use cases that's probably been the biggest driver, think about the omnichannel and retail. Health care is a newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. And then the third trend around the Android transition. We still have lots of momentum around the Android transition and a lot of opportunity left in that. 
We have -- our market share in Android is still around 60%, but Android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. We've often talked about the transition from -- transitioning older legacy Windows devices to Android. But today, I think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older Android devices is actually bigger. 
Our estimate is that they're now low double-digit millions of Android devices in the market with a somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old Windows devices used to have, and which we expect that there's about a high single-digit million Windows devices out there. So it's more of a balanced perspective, and we certainly like to get both of those. And -- but Android has been a great catalyst for growth for us."

Both printing and supplies were up double-digits in the quarter. Our printing business is up across the portfolio. We did, I think, benefit from some pent-up demand, particularly in EMEA. Remember, EMEA also was hit harder early on in the pandemic. So there was probably a little bit more of a rebound to be had there. 
I'd also say, though, that we have, early in 2020, we took a number of actions to strengthen our go-to-market and strengthen our channel ecosystem, particularly around printing. And I think that is now bearing fruit for us also. So we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing, specifically. 
But we did see our business through -- or our smaller business -- small and mid-sized business recover quite nicely. We recovered faster than we had expected. I think it's fair to say, in Q4, manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical. We have a much -- strong vertical for printing, generally, but lighter over the last year, but that was also coming back and strengthening. And RFID was actually a very strong quarter for printing. I think it was a record quarter for print RFID.  
And then on supplies, we did see a strong performance in supplies, particularly in North America. And Temptime also had a strong fourth quarter. But overall, though, I'd say that we have a very strong portfolio of smart and connected printers that have an unrivaled manageability through our Link-OS operating system, and that is a true differentiator in the market."

But I'd say that, starting with our products and solutions, are now mission-critical for our enterprise customers, and they need that to compete effectively in their on-demand economy. The sales to our larger companies, larger customers that we talked about in an earlier question, remained strong. 
And they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel, as an example. And I'd say our larger customers who are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic, to align with how consumers wanted to behave how the economy was working at that point, while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it.  
But I think, now, we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete. Competing in the same way they did prior to COVID is not necessarily going to be a successful formula. And I think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic, and we've been able to gain share. Our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes, and I think we were able to do that well and seize some opportunities that way. 
So we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand, you can say, which helped us in Q4, and I expect it to help us in Q1 here also.

And I think we've had a good healthy clip of new customers, and I expect that we will continue to add new use cases, new applications. 
If you look at our portfolio of solutions, we've invested meaningfully to ensure we can expand the number of use cases that help address our customers' most pressing problems. So we feel good about our competitive positioning and our ability to win some of these new use cases. They may not necessarily be brand-new customers, but they're brand-new use-cases. 
Joe, I don't know if you have any comments?"

I mean I would add, I mean, to your point about is there a big margin difference between the 2, I would say, not noticeably.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional first quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 28% or 25% on an organic basis. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3%, a 620 basis point year-over-year improvement. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.79, a 79% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Our teams executed well to satisfy a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel and continued strong demand from large customers to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. 
We realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our 4 regions. Each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. We also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses. While at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
Given our momentum and pace of innovation, we are increasingly confident in our growth prospects. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results in more detail and discuss our improved 2021 outlook."

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Direct sales t",748,"Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. 
Direct sales to large customers grew double digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. Our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 21.4%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing. We realized strong double-digit growth in services and software and also had strong growth in our RFID solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies, each growing double digits. 
In EMEA, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all subregions and solutions offerings. 
APAC returned to growth with sales up 19%, led by strength in China, Australia, New Zealand and India. 
Latin America also returned to growth in all subregions, with sales increasing 31%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and software margin. 
The favorable year-on-year impact from China tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. We have been accelerating high-return investments in the business while prudently managing discretionary costs. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, 620 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase. 
EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $214 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in 2 companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt-leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at a modest 0.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered Q2 with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the broad-based robust demand we are seeing across virtually every dimension of our business as customers step up their plans to invest in digital transformation. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q2 guide and to substantially raise our full year outlook. 
In Q2, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 38% and 42%. This outlook assumes a 450 to 500 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. It also assumes approximately $18 million of premium freight expense, which is roughly the same gross profit impact we realized in Q2 2020 from the combination of premium freight, COVID mitigation and China tariff impacts. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4 to $4.20. 
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 18% and 22%, which reflects our increasing optimism for solid growth in the second half of the year, despite supply chain constraints from certain product components. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. 
We have raised our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and meaningful gross margin expansion from the prior year, despite an expectation for premium freight charges of $50 million to $60 million as we work to mitigate global supply chain challenges. 
We now expect free cash flow to be at least $850 million for the year due to our revised outlook for increased profitable growth. 
Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in the markets we serve."

Our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic. 
Slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. 
Businesses across all industries are adopting solutions that digitize and automate their operations at the edge to help them compete more effectively in today's increasingly on demand economy. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' frontline associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as machine learning, prescriptive analytics and computer vision. 
We have been making solid progress integrating Reflexis market-leading workforce management and real-time task management solutions with our existing software applications to optimize the experience for frontline workers as well as reduce complexity for the corporate teams that support them. 
Our value proposition is to ensure the best next action for every worker is easily identified, assigned and completed, leveraging artificial intelligence gathered from real-time inventory or point-of-sale data. 
We are receiving very positive feedback from customers on the software portfolio enhancements we have planned for this year that will enable a unified experience across labor planning, tasking and workforce communications. 
We also continue to invest to accelerate the go-to-market traction of our growing suite of solutions. 
Slide 11 highlights how the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business. Consumers have been raising their service level expectations in this on-demand economy. Enterprises are investing in Zebra solutions with an increased sense of urgency due to a significant increase in omnichannel shopping. Forecast for global e-commerce sales and parcel shipping volumes to double over the next several years. 
Track and trace becoming increasingly important for a wide range of use cases and health care patients seeking a more digital experience. Automating strained workflows with proven technology provides an attractive return on investment. The benefits to the enterprise also include increased productivity and efficiency as well as higher customer and patient satisfaction. These opportunities are not exclusive to large enterprise customers, as we are seeing similar trends with small and medium-sized businesses. 
To capitalize on the favorable e-commerce trends I just mentioned. Yesterday, we announced the launch of Zebra's first cloud connected label printer designed specifically for the small business, home office customer. Featuring eco-friendly cartridges and mobile application software to easily design and print labels from anywhere. 
With the launch of the ZSP Series printer, we enter an approximately $400 million market with an attractive recurring supplies revenue stream. We have been innovating at a record pace despite the pandemic, and this so called label printing offering is a proof point of our focus on expanding into attractive adjacent markets where we can provide a differentiated offering. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We understand the operational challenges our customers face in the increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses of all sizes in a variety of end markets turned to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. 
In retail, there has been a sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping. We retain business, retailers need to deliver goods in a timely manner or make them available for pickup when promised. 
To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. 
For example, a leading U.K. supermarket chain recently purchased over 5,000 Zebra ZQ610 mobile printers for nearly 1,400 stores and added thousands more TC52s, TC77s and PS20s for their existing Zebra fleet of devices to enable inventory management, omnichannel fulfillment and other critical use cases across their operations. 
They are also evaluating Zebra's workforce management and scheduling software applications for use across all their stores. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from a large fashion accessories retail customer who has adopted our new option for Zebra prescriptive analytics to feed directly into our Reflexis workforce and task management software offering. 
Other retail customers are planning to adopt this capability soon to leverage the synergistic benefits. 
In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce adoption continues to drive exponential growth in parcel volumes, putting pressure on supply chains, even as they hire more workers. This is 1 of many reasons a wide variety of companies are attempting to digitize their operations with our technology. A large car rental company recently began deploying 5,000 ET56 rugged tablets at their airport locations to enable mobile associates to perform point-of-sale check in for improved customer service. 
In healthcare, the need for real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for technology that ensures safe and efficient care, continue to make health care our highest growth end market opportunity. 
A top-ranked U.S. hospital system recently selected Zebra's mobile scan and print solutions to integrate with their new electronic health record software application for patient bedside care, which enables positive patient ID, specimen collection and medication verification. Zebra is easy to use mobility solution and device management applications allows this customer to streamline clinician workflows, increase accuracy and enhance safe patient care. 
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, sales rebounded to double-digit growth in Q1. We are focused on increasing automation and workflows for our customers and have been recognized as a thought leader in this market. 
We recently secured a takeaway win with a global food manufacturer who purchased more than 1,000 Zebra MC93 mobile computers and ET51 tablets. This customer has been equipping an increasing number of associates with technology to enhance their manufacturing, shipping and receiving workflows.. 
Ease of use, functionality, life cycle management and support were notable selection criteria cited by this customer. 
In closing, we are performing well in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

So it's hard to kind of pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker, but I'll probably just highlight maybe North America is particularly strong as being also our largest region here. We grew by 28%. So we saw very broad based demand. So across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio, about printing supplies, mobile computing, RFID, services, software, they were all up double digits.

It started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. And health care patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience that they prefer that also. And our purpose-built solutions are critical for health care providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive -- and to greater productivity for the health care providers across their operations. And some of our solutions in health care also use specifically for COVID response like drive through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth."

If you look at the regions nominally, the 1 that swung the most from last quarter was Latin America. Latin America was the 1 that was hardest hit in the pandemic and has rebounded the most, but it's also our smallest region. 
In terms of verticals, another 1 that is notable is manufacturing, which was hit very hard in the pandemic as well, and we're seeing some good rebound in that area. 
I think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is 1 of deal size and customer size, right? So notably, our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers investing in e-commerce and digitization. 
We're now seeing that in the small and medium business, which, of course, manifest in our run rate."

We see the theme around how most companies want to automate and digitize their operations as playing a big role in driving this. Across every vertical, I would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data as well as react to data. 
We see the relationship with Reflexis is very synergistic in that if you have a mobile device, you can now look at inventory stockouts or other information and upload that to the Reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest ROI action and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device. 
So it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically kind of the network effect, it adds to the value of both device -- both solutions by having both under 1 roof. The progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. I'd say, if you go back 7, 8 years or something, a large supercenter in retail might have had 7 rate devices. And today, they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. And we think that having a shared device for those associates when they're in the store is a big objective for, I would say, the vast majority of our customers. And that's progressing. We have some good examples of where we've provided -- expanded our portfolio to provide kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve, and where we've combined  software and devices to really enable a much a deeper penetration. 
And Joe, maybe you want to share some examples of this?"

I would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in 2 categories. One is logistical bottlenecks, and the other 1 is around the industry-wide semiconductor shortages that's been in the press quite a bit lately. First on the logistical bottlenecks. That's really caused by an increase -- a combination of increase in demand combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic. So there are fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. Then you have add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. But this has resulted in air and ocean rates on pretty much on all our key routes, having increased by a factor of 2 since the start of the pandemic. So we are incurring premium freight costs as a result of this. And we are prioritizing customer -- meeting customer expected delivery dates. So we have been using -- leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from Europe, from China to Europe and the U.S. 
But this has had a negative -- a negligible impact on revenues. And I'd say our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business. 
The other issues around the in the semiconductor shortages, and this impacts some of our products more than others. Our teams have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. We have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which I think is helping us here. We tend to qualify multiple components where we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. We have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. But despite the -- both of these issues that I now mentioned, we're confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave, that the outlook incorporates both of these points. 
And lastly, then on the price action you asked about. We continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. So we always look at that. But there's -- we have no imminent plan of addressing or having a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues."

This isn't necessarily always a big bang where someone just rolls out devices to everyone but an expansion to additional sets of people, right? Now you use it for transport in a hospital, not just for nurses, for example. So that's been a big expansion. 
But we've also had some very innovative use cases. One of them we recently published in a press release for a tire chain that is now using our devices to not only keep track of the tires and the inventory, but also measure the tread depth and offer a new service to a customer. That type of innovation, I think, is going to be providing new use cases as well.

From a vertical perspective, 2 that I would call out is the government and the health care segment. The health care segments have seen a good acceleration internationally. You know that we've always had a reasonably strong position in North America. But now we're seeing deals in Japan, in Australia, in the U.K. that are sizable, right?

But we've also recognized that there are other important influencers. I'll give you an example to make this real, which is if you think about network equipment providers. People that provide Wi-Fi infrastructure, for example, for a customer, almost similar to the ISVs. They are looking to provide solutions to customers, like, for example, locationing capabilities, right, within the environments that they outfit.

We're coming out of COVID-19 with good momentum and is -- we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. We took the tack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. We actually launched more new products last year than we've done in any other year in the history, and I think that's coming back to benefit us here now. 
Our markets are, we think, very attractive. We have some strong secular growth trends. I mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that I think that's something that's very broad-based and very -- we believe, will be something that companies will invest in for several years. The -- we have some strong advantages also. We have our scale, our goal to market network, the ecosystem we have there. So there's a number of things that will make us formidable competitor from that perspective. And lastly, I'd say our vision, our enterprise asset intelligence, something that differentiates us from our competitors. When our customers talk to us, they're not looking to just a device for the here and now. They're looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future. 
From a share perspective, we get share data from independent sources, and they tend to lag. So we only have Q4 data, but we had a record share in mobile computing over -- I think it was over 50% on print, and we -- number 2, I think, is, I believe, 12%, certainly, directionally in that area.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.79, a 79% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Our teams executed well to satisfy a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel and continued strong demand from large customers to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy.  
We realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our 4 regions. Each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. We also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses. While at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth.

In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions.  
Direct sales to large customers grew double digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. Our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 21.4%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing. We realized strong double-digit growth in services and software and also had strong growth in our RFID solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic.  
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies, each growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all subregions and solutions offerings. APAC returned to growth with sales up 19%, led by strength in China, Australia, New Zealand and India.  
Latin America also returned to growth in all subregions, with sales increasing 31%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and softer margin.  
The favorable year-on-year impact from China tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. We have been accelerating high-return investments in the business while prudently managing discretionary costs.  
First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, 620 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase.  EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate.  
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $214 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in 2 companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions.  
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt-leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at a modest 0.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio.  
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered Q2 with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the broad-based robust demand we are seeing across virtually every dimension of our business as customers step up their plans to invest in digital transformation. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q2 guide and to substantially raise our full year outlook.  
In Q2, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 38% and 42%. This outlook assumes a 450 to 500 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes.  
We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. It also assumes approximately $18 million of premium freight expense, which is roughly the same gross profit impact we realized in Q2 2020 from the combination of premium freight, COVID mitigation and China tariff impacts. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4 to $4.20.  
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 18% and 22%, which reflects our increasing optimism for solid growth in the second half of the year, despite supply chain constraints from certain product components. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes.  
We have raised our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and meaningful gross margin expansion from the prior year, despite an expectation for premium freight charges of $50 million to $60 million as we work to mitigate global supply chain challenges.  
We now expect free cash flow to be at least $850 million for the year due to our revised outlook for increased profitable growth. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8.  
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in the markets we serve."

Our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic.  
Slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance.  
Businesses across all industries are adopting solutions that digitize and automate their operations at the edge to help them compete more effectively in today's increasingly on demand economy.  
With our innovative solutions, our customers' frontline associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as machine learning, prescriptive analytics and computer vision.  
We have been making solid progress integrating Reflexis market-leading workforce management and real-time task management solutions with our existing software applications to optimize the experience for frontline workers as well as reduce complexity for the corporate teams that support them.  
Our value proposition is to ensure the best next action for every worker is easily identified, assigned and completed, leveraging artificial intelligence gathered from real-time inventory or point-of-sale data.  
We are receiving very positive feedback from customers on the software portfolio enhancements we have planned for this year that will enable a unified experience across labor planning, tasking and workforce communications. We also continue to invest to accelerate the go-to-market traction of our growing suite of solutions.  
Slide 11 highlights how the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business. Consumers have been raising their service level expectations in this on-demand economy. Enterprises are investing in Zebra solutions with an increased sense of urgency due to a significant increase in omnichannel shopping. Forecast for global e-commerce sales and parcel shipping volumes to double over the next several years.  
Track and trace becoming increasingly important for a wide range of use cases and health care patients seeking a more digital experience. Automating strained workflows with proven technology provides an attractive return on investment. The benefits to the enterprise also include increased productivity and efficiency as well as higher customer and patient satisfaction. These opportunities are not exclusive to large enterprise customers, as we are seeing similar trends with small and medium-sized businesses. 
To capitalize on the favorable e-commerce trends I just mentioned. Yesterday, we announced the launch of Zebra's first cloud connected label printer designed specifically for the small business, home office customer. Featuring eco-friendly cartridges and mobile application software to easily design and print labels from anywhere.  
With the launch of the ZXP Series printer, we enter an approximately $400 million market with an attractive recurring supplies revenue stream. We have been innovating at a record pace despite the pandemic, and this so called label printing offering is a proof point of our focus on expanding into attractive adjacent markets where we can provide a differentiated offering.  
Now turning to Slide 12. We understand the operational challenges our customers face in the increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses of all sizes in a variety of end markets turned to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows.  
In retail, there has been a sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping. We retain business, retailers need to deliver goods in a timely manner or make them available for pickup when promised.  
To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively.  
For example, a leading U.K. supermarket chain recently purchased over 5,000 Zebra ZQ610 mobile printers for nearly 1,400 stores and added thousands more TC52s, TC77s and PS20s for their existing Zebra fleet of devices to enable inventory management, omnichannel fulfillment and other critical use cases across their operations.  
They are also evaluating Zebra's workforce management and scheduling software applications for use across all their stores. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from a large fashion accessories retail customer who has adopted our new option for Zebra prescriptive analytics to feed directly into our Reflexis workforce and task management software offering. Other retail customers are planning to adopt this capability soon to leverage the synergistic benefits.  
In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce adoption continues to drive exponential growth in parcel volumes, putting pressure on supply chains, even as they hire more workers. This is 1 of many reasons a wide variety of companies are attempting to digitize their operations with our technology. A large car rental company recently began deploying 5,000 ET56 rugged tablets at their airport locations to enable mobile associates to perform point-of-sale check in for improved customer service.  
In healthcare, the need for real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for technology that ensures safe and efficient care, continue to make health care our highest growth end market opportunity.  
A top-ranked U.S. hospital system recently selected Zebra's mobile scan and print solutions to integrate with their new electronic health record software application for patient bedside care, which enables positive patient ID, specimen collection and medication verification. Zebra is easy to use mobility solution and device management applications allows this customer to streamline clinician workflows increase accuracy and enhance safe patient care.  
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, sales rebounded to double-digit growth in Q1. We are focused on increasing automation and workflows for our customers and have been recognized as a thought leader in this market.  
We recently secured a takeaway win with a global food manufacturer who purchased more than 1,000 Zebra MC93 mobile computers and ET51 tablets. This customer has been equipping an increasing number of associates with technology to enhance their manufacturing, shipping and receiving workflows.
Ease of use, functionality, life cycle management and support were notable selection criteria cited by this customer. In closing, we are performing well in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows.  
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

And for us, that resulted in double-digit growth across all regions, across all products and solutions as well as all verticals, so very broad-based demand for us. We did see particularly strong growth from small and medium sized customers. And that was partly driven by pent-up demand, but it's only partly driven by pent-up demand.

I don't think we've ever had a quarter where we've had each of our 4 regions, each of our verticals and each of our main product categories, all growing double digits. So it's hard to kind of pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker, but I'll probably just highlight maybe North America is particularly strong as being also our largest region here. We grew by 28%. 
So we saw very broad based demand. So across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio. About printing supplies, mobile computing, RFID, services, software, they were all up double digits. And we had strong wins across all our vertical markets in North America and our newest vertical, the government vertical also demonstrated good growth. And I think, demonstrates that the investments we made in both product and the go-to-market for the government vertical paying off here now.  
On a -- from a vertical perspective, maybe health care is the one to highlight. It's been our fastest-growing vertical for some time, and we expect it to continue to be the fastest-growing one. It had a very nice performance in Q1. I think the transformation in health care is accelerating. It started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. And health care patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience that they prefer that also. 
And our purpose-built solutions are critical for health care providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive -- and to greater productivity for the health care providers across their operations. And some of our solutions in health care also use specifically for COVID response like drive through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth."

I think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is one of deal size and customer size, right? So notably, our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers investing in e-commerce and digitization.

We're very excited about how that's progressing. We see the theme around how most companies want to automate and digitize their operations as playing a big role in driving this across every vertical, I would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data as well as react to data. 
We see the relationship with Reflexis is very synergistic in that if you have a mobile device, you can now look at inventory stockouts or other information and upload that to the Reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest ROI action and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device.  
So it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically kind of the network effect, it adds to the value of both device -- both solutions by having both under one roof. The progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. I'd say, if you go back 7, 8 years or something, a large supercenter in retail might have had 7 or 8 devices. And today, they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. 
And we think that having a shared device for those associates when they're in the store is a big objective for, I would say, the vast majority of our customers. And that's progressing. We have some good examples of where we've provided -- expanded our portfolio to provide kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve, and where we've combined  software and devices to really enable a much a deeper penetration.

I would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in 2 categories. One is logistical bottlenecks, and the other one is around the industry-wide semiconductor shortages that's been in the press quite a bit lately. First on the logistical bottlenecks. That's really caused by an increase -- a combination of increase in demand, combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic. So there are fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. 
Then you have add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. But this has resulted in air and ocean rates on pretty much on all our key routes, having increased by a factor of 2 since the start of the pandemic. So we are incurring premium freight costs as a result of this. And we are prioritizing customer -- meeting customer expected delivery dates. 
So we have been using -- leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from Europe, from China to Europe and the U.S. But this has had a negative -- a negligible impact on revenues. And I'd say our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business.  
The other issues around the in the semiconductor shortages, and this impacts some of our products more than others. Our teams have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. We have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which I think is helping us here. We tend to qualify multiple components where we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. 
We have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. But despite the -- both of these issues that I now mentioned, we're confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave, that -- the outlook incorporates both of these points. And lastly, then on the price action you asked about. We continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. So we always look at that. But there's -- we have no imminent plan of addressing or having a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues."

Our printing -- RFID printing business was also particularly strong and even the supplies business was doing very well. [ Up ] time was up double digits. So it was a very strong performance across the board. And maybe also highlight that Joe mentioned earlier that manufacturing was up very strongly in Q1 after having had a tougher goal in 2020 and a little bit further beyond that, also it further that out. And printing is the most exposed to manufacturing. So when manufacturing goes up, that would have a disproportionate impact on our printing business."

So first, on smaller customers and what we're seeing, what's different. I'd say 2 things, Meta. One is irrespective of size, I would say, pretty much all customers across all verticals are looking to figure out how can they digitize and automate their businesses more. And they do look to our type of solutions to connect the physical world to the digital world to really help them connect that physical flow, those workflows into applications and automate them better. 
So that is a broad-based theme across basically all sizes of customers and verticals. The other point that would be our larger customers who generally able to pivot to a COVID-operating world better. They were generally seem to be essential businesses or deemed to be a essential business. While many of our smaller customers, many of them are in manufacturing, had to shut down.

You also asked about health care and on the health care beyond COVID-19 use cases, we're seeing an expansion, as Anders had mentioned in the prepared remarks, into new areas of health care like ambulatory care, like remote patient care, so the use of tablets, for example, in order to enable remote patient care is a big use case. 
Communication, of course, is a big use case and one that we're also seeing a lot of interest in is asset and people tracking in hospitals, locating the right person or locating the right asset for a particular procedure.

In terms of the mobile computing segment, we talked about the device for all. And as Andres had previously described, we're seeing an expansion of this. This isn't necessarily always a big bang where someone just rolls out devices to everyone but an expansion to additional sets of people, right? Now you use it for transport in a hospital, not just for nurses, for example. So that's been a big expansion. 
But we've also had some very innovative use cases. One of them we recently published in a press release for a tire chain that is now using our devices to not only keep track of the tires and the inventory, but also measure the tread depth and offer a new service to a customer. That type of innovation, I think, is going to be providing new use cases as well. And I'm also quite proud of our ability to grow the tablet segment that we accelerated through the acquisition of Explore some time ago and combined with our own ET tablets, and we have some very good traction there. 
From a vertical perspective, 2 that I would call out is the government and the health care segment. The health care segments have seen a good acceleration internationally. You know that we've always had a reasonably strong position in North America. But now we're seeing deals in Japan, in Australia, in the U.K. that are sizable, right? Where these institutions are modernizing their infrastructure globally. 
And government, as we've mentioned, is an area, not just in the U.S., but also in other countries, again, around the world that we've made substantial go-to-market investments, and we're now seeing accelerated growth most of the mobile computing, but also some printing opportunities with governments around the world."

And we also expect to continue to invest and grow OpEx as we accelerate investment in some of the higher ROI opportunities, including the continued integration of our software offerings with Reflexis."

But -- so competitive environment, first, I'd say we're very confident in our competitive positioning, I'd say, as confident as we've ever been probably. We're coming out of COVID-19 with good momentum and is -- we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. We took the tack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. We actually launched more new products last year than we've done in any other year in the history, and I think that's coming back to benefit us here now. 
Our markets are, we think, very attractive. We have some strong secular growth trends. I mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that I think that's something that's very broad-based and very -- we believe, will be something that companies will invest in for several years. The -- we have some strong advantages also. We have our scale, our goal to market network, the ecosystem we have there. 
So there's a number of things that will make us formidable competitor from that perspective. And lastly, I'd say our vision, our enterprise asset intelligence, something that differentiates us from our competitors. When our customers talk to us, they're not looking to just a device for the here and now. They're looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future. 
From a share perspective, we get share data from independent sources, and they tend to lag. So we only have Q4 data, but we had a record share in mobile computing over -- I think it was over 50% on print, and we -- number 2, I think, is, I believe, 12%, certainly, directionally in that area. 
On print, we have low 40%, 43% I think it is. And our second competitor is low double digits, I think also about 12%. And in scan, we have about 30%, where second largest is more like 24%. So we have strong position across our business. And your last question was about the mix of Android and Windows, and we now have over 85% of our mobile computing sales are Android."

Do you think that this overlap increases, particularly in the manufacturing realm. Is there any M&A to do here?

We realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our 4 regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. We also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses while at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth.

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition, and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Direct sales",748,"Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition, and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. 
Direct sales to large customers grew double digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. Our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 21.4%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing. We realized strong double-digit growth in services and software and also had strong growth in our RFID solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies each growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all subregions and solutions offerings. APAC returned to growth with sales up 19%, led by strength in China, Australia, New Zealand and India. 
Latin America also returned to growth in all subregions, with sales increasing 31%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and software margin. 
The favorable year-on-year impact from China tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. We have been accelerating high-return investments in the business while prudently managing discretionary costs. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, 620 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $214 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in 2 companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt-leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at a modest 0.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered Q2 with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the broad-based robust demand we are seeing across virtually every dimension of our business as customers step up their plans to invest in digital transformation. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q2 guide and to substantially raise our full year outlook. 
In Q2, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 38% and 42%. This outlook assumes a 450 to 500 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. It also assumes approximately $18 million of premium freight expense, which is roughly the same gross profit impact we realized in Q2 2020 from the combination of premium freight, COVID mitigation and China tariff impacts. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4 to $4.20. 
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 18% and 22%, which reflects our increasing optimism for solid growth in the second half of the year, despite supply chain constraints from certain product components. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. 
We have raised our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and meaningful gross margin expansion from the prior year, despite an expectation for premium freight charges of $50 million to $60 million as we work to mitigate global supply chain challenges. 
We now expect free cash flow to be at least $850 million for the year due to our revised outlook for increased profitable growth. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in the markets we serve."

Our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic. 
Slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. 
Businesses across all industries are adopting solutions that digitize and automate their operations at the edge to help them compete more effectively in today's increasingly on demand economy. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' frontline associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as machine learning, prescriptive analytics and computer vision. 
We have been making solid progress integrating Reflexis' market-leading workforce management and real-time task management solutions with our existing software applications to optimize the experience for frontline workers as well as reduce complexity for the corporate teams that support them. 
Our value proposition is to ensure the best next action for every worker is easily identified, assigned and completed, leveraging artificial intelligence gathered from real-time inventory or point-of-sale data. 
We are receiving very positive feedback from customers on the software portfolio enhancements we have planned for this year that will enable a unified experience across labor planning, tasking and workforce communications. We also continue to invest to accelerate the go-to-market traction of our growing suite of solutions.
Slide 11 highlights how the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business. Consumers have been raising their service level expectations in this on-demand economy. Enterprises are investing in Zebra solutions with an increased sense of urgency due to a significant increase in omnichannel shopping, forecast for global e-commerce sales and parcel shipping volumes to double over the next several years. 
Track and trace becoming increasingly important for a wide range of use cases and health care patients seeking a more digital experience. Automating strained workflows with proven technology provides an attractive return on investment. The benefits to the enterprise also include increased productivity and efficiency as well as higher customer and patient satisfaction. These opportunities are not exclusive to large enterprise customers, as we are seeing similar trends with small and medium-sized businesses. 
To capitalize on the favorable e-commerce trends I just mentioned. Yesterday, we announced the launch of Zebra's first cloud connected label printer designed specifically for the small business, home office customer, featuring eco-friendly cartridges and mobile application software to easily design and print labels from anywhere. 
With the launch of the ZXP Series printer, we enter an approximately $400 million market with an attractive recurring supplies revenue stream. We have been innovating at a record pace despite the pandemic, and this barcode label printing offering is a proof point of our focus on expanding into attractive adjacent markets where we can provide a differentiated offering. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We understand the operational challenges our customers face in the increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses of all sizes in a variety of end markets turned to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. 
In retail, there has been a sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping. To retain business, retailers need to deliver goods in a timely manner or make them available for pickup when promised. 
To address this challenge, a wide range of our retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. 
For example, a leading U.K. supermarket chain recently purchased over 5,000 Zebra ZQ610 mobile printers for nearly 1,400 stores and added thousands more TC52s, TC77s and PS20s for their existing Zebra fleet of devices to enable inventory management, omnichannel fulfillment and other critical use cases across their operations. They are also evaluating Zebra's workforce management and scheduling software applications for use across all their stores. 
Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from a large fashion accessories retail customer who has adopted our new option for Zebra prescriptive analytics to feed directly into our Reflexis workforce and task management software offering. Other retail customers are planning to adopt this capability soon to leverage the synergistic benefits. 
In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce adoption continues to drive exponential growth in parcel volumes, putting pressure on supply chains, even as they hire more workers. This is one of many reasons a wide variety of companies are attempting to digitize their operations with our technology. A large car rental company recently began deploying 5,000 ET56 rugged tablets at their airport locations to enable mobile associates to perform point-of-sale check in for improved customer service. 
In healthcare, the need for real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for technology that ensures safe and efficient care continue to make health care our highest growth end market opportunity. 
A top-ranked U.S. hospital system recently selected Zebra's mobile scan and print solutions to integrate with their new electronic health record software application for patient bedside care, which enables positive patient ID, specimen collection and medication verification. Zebra's easy to use mobility solution and device management applications allows this customer to streamline clinician workflows, increase accuracy and enhance safe patient care. 
Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, sales rebounded to double-digit growth in Q1. We are focused on increasing automation and workflows for our customers and have been recognized as a thought leader in this market. 
We recently secured a takeaway win with a global food manufacturer who purchased more than 1,000 Zebra MC93 mobile computers and ET51 tablets. This customer has been equipping an increasing number of associates with technology to enhance their manufacturing, shipping and receiving workflows. Ease of use, functionality, life cycle management and support were notable selection criteria cited by this customer. 
In closing, we are performing well in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

I don't think we've ever had a quarter where we've had each of our 4 regions, each of our verticals and each of our main product categories all growing double digits. So it's hard to kind of pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker, but I'll probably just highlight maybe North America is particularly strong as being also our largest region here. We grew by 28%.
So we saw very broad based demand so across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio. But printing supplies, mobile computing, RFID, services, software, they were all up double digits. And we had strong wins across all our vertical markets in North America and our newest vertical, the government vertical, also demonstrated good growth. And I think demonstrates that the investments we made in both product and the go-to-market for the government vertical paying off here now. 
On a -- from a vertical perspective, maybe health care is the one to highlight. It's been our fastest-growing vertical for some time, and we expect it to continue to be the fastest-growing one. It had a very nice performance in Q1. I think the transformation in health care is accelerating. It started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. And health care patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience, that they prefer that also. 
And our purpose-built solutions are critical for health care providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive -- and to greater productivity for the health care providers across their operations. And some of our solutions in health care also use specifically for COVID response like drive-through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth."

I think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is one of deal size and customer size, right? So notably, our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers investing in e-commerce and digitization.

We see the theme around how most companies want to automate and digitize their operations as playing a big role in driving this. Across every vertical, I would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data as well as react to data. 
We see the relationship with Reflexis as very synergistic in that if you have a mobile device, you can now look at inventory stockouts or other information and upload that to the Reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest ROI action and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device. 
So it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically kind of the network effect, it adds to the value of both device -- both solutions by having both under 1 roof. The progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. I'd say, if you go back 7, 8 years or something, a large supercenter in retail might have had 7 or 8 devices. And today, they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. And we think that having a shared device for those associates when they're in the store is a big objective for, I would say, the vast majority of our customers. And that's progressing. We have some good examples of where we've provided -- expanded our portfolio to provide kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve, and where we've combined software and devices to really enable a much a deeper penetration.

I would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in 2 categories. One is logistical bottlenecks, and the other one is around the industry-wide semiconductor shortages that has been in the press quite a bit lately. First on the logistical bottlenecks. That's really caused by an increase -- a combination of increase in demand, combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic. So there are fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. 
Then you have add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. But this has resulted in air and ocean rates on pretty much on all our key routes having increased by a factor of 2 since the start of the pandemic. So we are incurring premium freight costs as a result of this. And we are prioritizing customer -- meeting customer expected delivery dates. 
So we have been using -- leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from Europe, from China to Europe and the U.S. But this has had a negative -- a negligible impact on revenues. And I'd say our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business. 
The other issues around the semiconductor shortages, and this impacts some of our products more than others. Our teams have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. We have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which I think is helping us here. We tend to qualify multiple components when we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. 
We have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. But despite the -- both of these issues that I now mentioned, we're confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave, that -- the outlook incorporates both of these points. And lastly, then on the price action you asked about. We continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. So we always look at that. But there's -- we have no imminent plan of addressing or having a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues."

Our printing -- RFID printing business was also particularly strong and even the supplies business was doing very well. Cap time was up double digits.

And maybe also highlight that Joe mentioned earlier that manufacturing was up very strongly in Q1 after having had a tougher go in 2020 and a little bit further beyond that, also it further that out.

So first, on smaller customers and what we're seeing, what's different. I'd say 2 things, Meta.

And we see these types of solutions, which are more contactless, as having a great -- being in demand and see more deployment of them. 
I would say also our software solutions are having great traction. The combination of Reflexis, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect provides a very differentiated value proposition for us. And each of those offerings, by -- in and of themselves are performing very well. But when you then combine it with as of the suite and then look at the -- how they interact with our mobile devices, that provides a very compelling offering, which we see having great opportunities for us to continue to grow. 
And some of our other intelligent edge solutions are still probably little slow in ramping as we've had -- still have a -- we don't have access to our customers' facilities to the extent we used to, to do pilots and proof of concepts and other types of engagements like that.

In terms of the mobile computing segment, we talked about the device for all. And as Anders had previously described, we're seeing an expansion of this. This isn't necessarily always a big bang where someone just rolls out devices to everyone, but an expansion to additional sets of people, right? Now you use it for transport in a hospital, not just for nurses, for example. So that's been a big expansion. 
But we've also had some very innovative use cases. One of them we recently published in a press release for a tire chain that is now using our devices to not only keep track of the tires and the inventory, but also measure the tread depth and offer a new service to a customer. That type of innovation, I think, is going to be providing new use cases as well. And I'm also quite proud of our ability to grow the tablet segment that we accelerated through the acquisition of Explore some time ago and combined with our own ET tablets, and we have some very good traction there. 
From a vertical perspective, 2 that I would call out is the government and the health care segments. The health care segments have seen a good acceleration internationally. We've always had a reasonably strong position in North America. But now we're seeing deals in Japan, in Australia, in the U.K. that are sizable, right? Where these institutions are modernizing their infrastructure globally. 
And government, as we'd mentioned, is an area, not just in the U.S., but also in other countries, again, around the world that we've made substantial go-to-market investments, and we're now seeing accelerated growth, most of the mobile computing, but also some printing opportunities with governments around the world."

But we've also recognized that there are other important influencers. I'll give you an example to make this real, which is if you think about network equipment providers. People that provide Wi-Fi infrastructure, for example, for a customer, almost similar to the ISVs. They are looking to provide solutions to customers, like, for example, locationing capabilities, right, within the environments that they outfit.

We're coming out of COVID-19 with good momentum and is -- we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. We took the tack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. We actually launched more new products last year than we've done in any other year in the history, and I think that's coming back to benefit us here now. 
Our markets are, we think, very attractive. We have some strong secular growth trends. I mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that I think that's something that's very broad-based and very -- we believe will be something that companies will invest in for several years. The -- we have some strong advantages also. We have our scale, our goal to market network, the ecosystem we have there. So there's a number of things that will make us formidable competitor from that perspective. 
And lastly, I'd say our vision, our enterprise asset intelligence, something that differentiates us from our competitors. When our customers talk to us, they're not looking to just buy a device for the here and now. They're looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future.

Anders will begin with our second quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2021 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders."

Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44%, or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. 
Despite ongoing industry-wide supply chain challenges, our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers, both direct and through our distribution channel. 
Similar to Q1, we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. 
Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. 
We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. [indiscernible] continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our improved 2021 outlook."
393488,1674613019,2360413,"Zebra Technologies Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Zebra Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Anders.

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. 
Our Asset Intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 51.2%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 35.1%, driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software, along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as customers recover from the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across subregions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20%, led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continued its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all subregions with sales increasing 79%. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins and contribution from our recent high-margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. 
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx while prioritizing high-return investments in the business. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6%, a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. 
In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our machine vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. In addition, we also repurchased $25 million of Zebra shares. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q2 at a modest 0.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which affords flexibility to invest in attractive business acquisitions. 
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the global pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. 
For the second half of the year, we now expect the year-on-year unfavorable impact from these items to be approximately $85 million, which translates to a 3 percentage point negative gross margin impact. 
Our supply chain team has been taking extraordinary actions to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging global environment. Global freight costs for virtually all modalities of delivery across our supply chain continue to escalate. Impacts include higher global shipping cost per kilo, a shift in modality from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers in order to meet customer commitments. We expect premium freight costs to abate once component supply and freight capacity improves. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. The pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for more digital health care experience. We entered Q3 with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see broad-based robust demand across virtually every dimension of our business. 
This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q3 guide and substantially raise our full year outlook. In Q3, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 21% and 25% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage from the prior year. It also assumes approximately $45 million of premium freight expense, which is $37 million higher than last year. We are also experiencing higher product component costs, which we expect to largely offset with recently announced price increases. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10. 
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 23% and 25%, which reflects our increasing optimism for strong growth in the second half of the year despite significant industry supply chain constraints for certain product components as well as transportation bottlenecks. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
Despite our significantly increased expectation for transitory premium freight charges that we just highlighted, we are maintaining our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and gross margin expansion from the prior year. 
We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year due to increased profitability. 
Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. 
Note that our outlook does not include any projected results from the pending acquisition of Fetch Robotics. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. 
Slide 11 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. 
We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and machine vision. 
Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end markets, which demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. 
A large European postal service will be deploying approximately 80,000 [ TCP27s ] to their carriers. Continuing a long-standing relationship, they are upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service. 
We are also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to [ optimize ] and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our [ ET256 ] tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process. This solution will also improve the customer experience by providing advanced notification of delivery. 
Large public sector hospital system in the U.K. is utilizing our mobile computers, printers and wrist bands to enable real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and ensure safe and efficient care. This customer is using our solutions for specimen tracking, patient monitoring and blood transfusions in emergency and operating rooms. Their employees also use our mobile computers for physical security access. 
A real U.S. supermarket operator recently decided to implement our Reflexis workforce management tool for labor scheduling and employee self-service to more efficiently manage their resources across more than 100 locations. This solution also frees up their associates to focus more on customer service versus administrative tasks. 
More broadly in retail, the sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping requires retailers to deliver goods in a timely manner and make them available for pickup when promised. To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. 
Slide 13 highlights significant recent investments we are making in advance -- to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in the warehouse and in manufacturing. 
In May, we announced the launch of our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions to increase efficiency and quality inspection in our customer's operations. We complemented this product launch with the acquisition of Adapt division, whose software enables customers to easily build machine vision and deep learning applications. 
We are excited about our opportunity to penetrate this high-growth, fragmented market, and we are actively recruiting channel partners to scale the business. 
In July, we announced our intent to acquire Fetch Robotics, which has the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry, powered by a cloud software platform that can be deployed stand-alone or integrated with warehouse management systems. Our vision is to orchestrate both robots and technology-equipped frontline workers through software in the cloud to optimize material transport and order fulfillment workflows. 
As a venture investment, Fetch has been a trusted partner to Zebra, and we are excited about the prospects for our combined businesses. 
In closing, we are confident in our growth prospects given the momentum we are experiencing in the business and our heightened pace of innovation. We are energized by our vibrant core markets as well as the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

They've been very well documented by the press, obviously, over the last few months, and we are impacted. I said impact, though, is not uniform across all components. Some components are impacted much more than others, but it's a much larger number of components that we're kind of working than we would in a normal quarter. 
But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations and there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time to ensure we get this much available product to provide to our customers as we can. 
We did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. And I said, despite these shortages and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full year outlook that we announced today."

So maybe if you take us back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks because there's really 3 different areas in terms of -- in the incremental cost. 
One, which we've seen earlier in the year, and we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestion. So we're on the supply side of it. That's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything, oceans gone up, air rates have stabilized. 
In addition, because of the global supply constraints, along with the increased global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners, along with shipping a higher percentage of printing, in particular, via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory costs from Q2 into the second half. 
In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, in particular, for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID further constrained supply. 
So as we see today, you're expecting the impact to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. 
So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's 2 things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter."

The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID, and we don't see any -- the abatement in those trends. They're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example in retail of the retail vertical. Most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. 
We did see double-digit growth in all regions as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our main 4 -- 4 main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium-sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely part, to a large degree, driven by our small, medium-sized customers. And that was partly, I think, a result of pent-up demand, but we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. 
And based on this performance, I do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. Our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. Joe?"

When it comes to the the backlog and the pipeline, it is very strong as you're seeing. And what I can underscore what Anders was saying, this pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. 
And we also are enjoying because customers are aware of the supply shortages, we're enjoying good pipeline visibility. Our customers are working with us to give us that visibility for an advance, and that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year."

This is more on the Sense side of the Sense Analyze Act framework, but it helps us provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on. 
This is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. It's a multibillion-dollar market that our new portfolio then can address, although we're not addressing the entire market on day 1. But we are continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities that we can go after a bigger and bigger part of the market, but we really are focusing initially mostly on the fixed industrial scanning market. 
Our value proposition, we believe, is very strong, and the focus is on the ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are, we believe, 2 strong differentiators that we have. 
The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the, say, the cameras that we -- and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in machine vision, or fixed industrial scanning, or incorporate machine vision and fixed industrial scanning into their workflows. 
And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time. And we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering. And we felt that Adaptive division had a very attractive solution, very strong solution, and there was nice fit with Zebra."

So I think if you -- from an OpEx perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple of major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. 
The first was -- last year, we took some actions mid-year around salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as a lower incentive comp as we're obviously below our planned targets for the year. So those 2 alone drive a significant increase year-on-year, along with the full year of Reflexis us in the P&L. And starting to, again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary cost increases. 
So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter."

I think the Adaptive vision and the Fetch Robotics acquisitions are -- we're excited about them. We think that we can deliver good growth and good returns on those. 
We do look at all M&A opportunities as a way for us to accelerate and advance our EEI vision. We're targeting selective bolt-on acquisitions that also have high growth. And look at around the -- what I talked earlier about the customers' need and interest in digitizing and automating a number of workflows across all of their supply chains. As said, that provides good opportunities for us to continue to add to our capabilities. And so we do look at M&A as a way for us to accelerate that growth. And we have a we have a strong balance sheet that can support M&A activities also."

But I think your first question was around the fixed industrial scanning machine vision market. So we believe it's a very attractive market. It's a near adjacency to what we do. And it's quite a fragmented market. 
If you look at the market share table there, there's 1 or 2 players that have reasonable share, but then it's a lot of -- a long tail of smaller players. We are entering the market, say, primarily through our -- or initially with our fixed industrial scanning portfolio, which is [ sits ] closes to our core competencies and use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say, on the capabilities, both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market. 
Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right? If you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation and the value add comes from the software. And we certainly expect that to be the case here also. So we are investing in building more of that software capability. That division was an inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. 
From a -- we should also underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market. I mentioned earlier, I think, that we are putting in a specialized track in our Partner Connect reseller program to specifically address recruiting fixed industrial scanning machine vision partners to help accelerate that growth. And maybe, Joe, you can expand on that a little bit?"

So you know that we have the fixed industrial scanning and the machine vision parts of this. 
The fixed industrial scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. And we're, of course, translating that technically to succeed in the machine vision part. That's where the software piece is essential. And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry-leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains. 
But there's more to it than that. We specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease-of-use value proposition. That's critical to these customers. How easy is it to use and to deploy. And that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win, which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. 
All of these solutions are deployed through partners for us. We're a very partner-centric company, as you know. And that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the machine vision space. And making our software easy to use is a value proposition, not just to the end users, but to the partner specifically. So hopefully, that's helpful."

So we believe we understand the market, we understand the team, and we see great opportunities to leverage the Fetch's broad portfolio of AMRs. They have the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. And they have a very strong, very capable cloud-based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots. 
And then Zebra, we have been more focused on technology enabled, the workers in warehouses. And by combining those 2 to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers, we think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. 
Fetch has originally -- say, initially been mostly focused on the kind of contains market. So more of movement of goods, but we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also.

So our efforts in health care continues to expand into new areas. 
It's also expanding geographically. So the win we talked about today was in Europe. And I think here also the health care patients are taking a look out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities also. They are seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on health care providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients.

But the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads-up displays and the need to track and trace -- sourcing components at subsuppliers through assembly, all the way through distribution is putting -- providing great opportunities for us. 
So all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in Q2."

There are partners who we currently have who are also in the fixed industrial scanning machine vision space that we are obviously having a great -- already have a relationship with and with easy expansion to add our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision capabilities to their portfolio, but also recruiting new partners that are not necessarily Zebra partners today, but are strong in that space. 
And we've seen good interest and response rates for them -- from them. And I think they have been impressed with our solutions and they see how we can add value to them. So this is obviously a big part of what we need to do now and for the next year to ensure that we deliver the revenue growth that we are intending or planning for.

I appreciate that you're asking this question because channel is central to our go-to-market strategy, right? We're a very channel-centric company. And as we were designing this go-to-market approach, this -- we spent a lot of time on this. 
First, we created a dedicated track in our Partner Connect program, which is very important to serve the needs of these particular partners. A percentage of our current partners are also machine vision distributors and sellers. I would estimate that that's a small percentage. 
The majority of machine vision partners we do need to create -- we need to recruit, I'm sorry. And we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already. We have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force. And that's because of what we were talking about earlier that we've designed the product with a particular value proposition geared towards partners. 
We wanted it to make easy for those partners to deploy and sell these solutions. We think that's critical to success, and that's essential in how we've designed the product. 
And so we're very pleased with both the number of partners we've already been able to recruit and the pipeline of additional partners that we have that is interested in selling our product."

Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44%, or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow.  
Despite ongoing industry-wide supply chain challenges, our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers, both direct and through our distribution channel.
Similar to Q1, we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets.  
Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy.  
We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. We also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth.

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers.
Our Asset Intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 51.2%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 35.1%, driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software, along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as customers recover from the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across subregions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20%, led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continued its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all subregions with sales increasing 79%. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins and contribution from our recent high-margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment.
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx while prioritizing high-return investments in the business. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6%, a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. 
In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our machine vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. In addition, we also repurchased $25 million of Zebra shares. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q2 at a modest 0.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which affords flexibility to invest in attractive business acquisitions. 
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the global pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. For the second half of the year, we now expect the year-on-year unfavorable impact from these items to be approximately $85 million, which translates to a 3 percentage point negative gross margin impact. 
Our supply chain team has been taking extraordinary actions to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging global environment. Global freight costs for virtually all modalities of delivery across our supply chain continue to escalate. Impacts include higher global shipping cost per kilo, a shift in modality from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers in order to meet customer commitments. We expect premium freight costs to abate once component supply and freight capacity improves. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. The pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for more digital health care experience. We entered Q3 with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see broad-based robust demand across virtually every dimension of our business. 
This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q3 guide and substantially raise our full year outlook. In Q3, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 21% and 25% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisitions and foreign currency changes.  
We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage from the prior year. It also assumes approximately $45 million of premium freight expense, which is $37 million higher than last year. We are also experiencing higher product component costs, which we expect to largely offset with recently announced price increases. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10.  
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 23% and 25%, which reflects our increasing optimism for strong growth in the second half of the year despite significant industry supply chain constraints for certain product components as well as transportation bottlenecks. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.  
Despite our significantly increased expectation for transitory premium freight charges that we just highlighted, we are maintaining our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and gross margin expansion from the prior year. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year due to increased profitability. 
Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. Note that our outlook does not include any projected results from the pending acquisition of Fetch Robotics. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook.  
Slide 11 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance.
We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and machine vision.  
Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end markets, which demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care.
A large European postal service will be deploying approximately 80,000 TC57s to their carriers. Continuing a long-standing relationship, they are upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service.
We are also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our ET56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process. This solution will also improve the customer experience by providing advanced notification of delivery.
Large public sector hospital system in the U.K. is utilizing our mobile computers, printers and wrist bands to enable real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and ensure safe and efficient care. This customer is using our solutions for specimen tracking, patient monitoring and blood transfusions in emergency and operating rooms. Their employees also use our mobile computers for physical security access.  
A regional U.S. supermarket operator recently decided to implement our Reflexis workforce management tool for labor scheduling and employee self-service to more efficiently manage their resources across more than 100 locations. This solution also frees up their associates to focus more on customer service versus administrative tasks.
More broadly in retail, the sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping requires retailers to deliver goods in a timely manner and make them available for pickup when promised. To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively.
Slide 13 highlights significant recent investments, we are making in advance -- to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in the warehouse and in manufacturing.
In May, we announced the launch of our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions to increase efficiency and quality inspection in our customer's operations. We complemented this product launch with the acquisition of Adaptive Vision, whose software enables customers to easily build machine vision and deep learning applications. We are excited about our opportunity to penetrate this high-growth, fragmented market, and we are actively recruiting channel partners to scale the business. 
In July, we announced our intent to acquire Fetch Robotics, which has the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry, powered by a cloud software platform that can be deployed stand-alone or integrated with warehouse management systems. Our vision is to orchestrate both robots and technology-equipped frontline workers through software in the cloud to optimize material transport and order fulfillment workflows.
As a venture investment, Fetch has been a trusted partner to Zebra, and we are excited about the prospects for our combined businesses.  
In closing, we are confident in our growth prospects given the momentum we are experiencing in the business and our heightened pace of innovation. We are energized by our vibrant core markets as well as the emerging prospects, we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows.
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

Some components are impacted much more than others, but it's a much larger number of components that we're kind of working than we would in a normal quarter.  
But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations and there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time to ensure we get this much available product to provide to our customers as we can.

So maybe if you take us back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks because there's really 3 different areas in terms of -- in the incremental cost. One, which we've seen earlier in the year, and we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestion. So we're on the supply side of it. That's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything, oceans gone up, air rates have stabilized.
In addition, because of the global supply constraints, along with the increase to global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners, along with shipping a higher percentage of printing, in particular, via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory costs from Q2 into the second half. 
In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, in particular, for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID, there's further constrained supply. 
So as we see today, you're expecting the impact to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. 
So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's 2 things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter."

First, we're obviously very excited about and pleased with the performance we had in the second quarter. We exceeded the high end of the guidance range here. 
And to the previous question, we have extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy very strong demand in a supply-constrained environment. 
The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID, and we don't see any abatement in those trends. They're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing, digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example in retail of the retail vertical. Most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. 
We did see double-digit growth in all regions as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our 4 main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium-sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely partly -- to a large degree, driven by our small, medium-sized customers. And that was partly, I think, a result of pent-up demand, but we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. 
And based on this performance, I do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. Our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. Joe?"

And we're trying to serve all of the demand we can and taking our inventory to the lower end of our -- what we consider our healthy range.
When it comes to the backlog and the pipeline, it is very strong as you're seeing. And what I can underscore what Anders was saying, this pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. 
And we also are enjoying because customers are aware of the supply shortages, we're enjoying good pipeline visibility. Our customers are working with us to give us that visibility for an advance, and that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year."

These are solutions that really accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This is more on the Sense side of the Sense Analyze Act framework, but it helps us provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on.
This is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. It's a multibillion-dollar market that our new portfolio then can address, although we're not addressing the entire market on day 1. But we are continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities that we can go after a bigger and bigger part of the market, but we really are focusing initially mostly on the fixed industrial scanning market.
Our value proposition, we believe, is very strong, and the focus is on the ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are, we believe, 2 strong differentiators that we have. 
The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the, say, the cameras that we -- and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in machine vision, or fixed industrial scanning, or incorporate machine vision and fixed industrial scanning into their workflows. 
And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time. And we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering. And we felt that Adaptive Vision had a very attractive solution, very strong solution, and there was nice fit with Zebra."

So I think if you -- from an OpEx perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple of major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. 
The first was -- last year, we took some actions mid-year around, salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as a lower incentive comp as we're obviously below our planned targets for the year. So those 2 alone drive a significant increase year-on-year, along with the full year of Reflexis us in the P&L. And starting to, again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary cost increases.
So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter."

But I think your first question was around the fixed industrial scanning machine vision market. So we believe it's a very attractive market. It's a near adjacency to what we do. And it's quite a fragmented market. 
If you look at the market share table there, there's 1 or 2 players that have reasonable share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players. We are entering the market, say, primarily through our -- or initially with our fixed industrial scanning portfolio, which is [ distinctive process ]  to our core competencies and use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say, on the capabilities, both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market.
Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right? If you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation and the value add comes from the software. And we certainly expect that to be the case here also. So we are investing in building more of that software capability. That division was an inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. 
From a -- we should also not underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market.

So you know that we have the fixed industrial scanning and the machine vision parts of this. 
The fixed industrial scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. And we're, of course, translating that technically to succeed in the machine vision part. That's where the software piece is essential. And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry-leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains.
But there's more to it than that. We specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease-of-use value proposition. That's critical to these customers. How easy is it to use and to deploy. And that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win, which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. 
All of these solutions are deployed through partners for us. We're a very partner-centric company, as you know. And that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the machine vision space. And making our software easy to use is a value proposition, not just to the end users, but to the partner specifically. So hopefully, that's helpful."

They have the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. And they have a very strong, very capable cloud-based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots. 
And then here at Zebra, we have been more focused on technology enabled, the workers in warehouses. And by combining those 2 to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers, we think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. 
Fetch has say, initially been mostly focused on the kind of contains market. So more of movement of goods, but we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also.

The logistical bottlenecks are the one that -- from the timing, I think, is still to be played out. Again, I think we expect -- no changes between now and the end of the year. But really, we're taking kind of 1 quarter at a time and reacting accordingly to optimize and maximize profitability as best we can."

On the labor side, there's always some upward movement in labor rates. But if you think of the amount of labor that goes into our cost of goods sold, it's very small.

In many areas, let's say, you mentioned Fetch specifically, we developed our own robots with SmartSight before. So there's certainly been a way for us to both learn the industry, but there's also attractive ways for us to leverage those investments across.

I mean, COVID has accelerated the secular trends that we talked about around our -- all our end markets are driving solutions that help to digitize and automate their workflows and empower frontline workers to be connected and optimally kind of utilized. 
Each of our primary vertical markets grew double digits in the second quarter, and we continue to invest in expanding in each of these ones. Specifically for health care, I'd say we saw health care -- our health care markets, they started in more acute care, but it's been moving into other areas like outpatient, remote patient care, COVID testing, vaccine distribution. So our efforts in health care continues to expand into new areas. 
It's also expanding geographically. So the win we talked about today was in Europe. And I think here also the health care patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities also. They are seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on health care providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients. And I'll say here, our purpose-built devices and solutions are critical for health care providers, not only to improve the patient journey but also to drive greater productivity for the health care providers."

One is that -- we know that health care systems, depending on where in the world you are, this is in a different stage, have pulled back on some of their spending because they didn't have income from the elective procedures that they usually enjoyed. And as we come out of the pandemic, we see more of that income returning to for-profit hospitals and then their ability to spend on these solutions returns as well. And we've seen that.

But it's great to see that we have this diversity in the business across our main 4 verticals and some other newer ones coming up. 
But in Q2 here, manufacturing, which was our fastest-growing vertical, manufacturing was the one that was the hardest hit by COVID-19 and the macro was a bit tougher going into that with tariffs and other things. But the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads-up displays and the need to track and trace -- sourcing components at sub-suppliers through assembly, all the way through distribution is putting -- providing great opportunities for us. 
So all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in Q2."

The majority of machine vision partners we do need to create -- we need to recruit, I'm sorry. And we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already. We have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force.

Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits.

Despite ongoing industry-wide supply chain challenges, our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers, both direct and through our distribution channel. 
Similar to Q1, we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. 
Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. 
We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. We also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth.

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. 
Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 51.2%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 35.1%, driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software, along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as customers recover from the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across subregions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20%, led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continued its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all subregions with sales increasing 79%. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins and contribution from our recent high-margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. 
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx while prioritizing high-return investments in the business. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6%, a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. 
In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our machine vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. In addition, we also repurchased $25 million of Zebra shares. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q2 at a modest 0.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which affords flexibility to invest in attractive business acquisitions. 
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the global pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. For the second half of the year, we now expect the year-on-year unfavorable impact from these items to be approximately $85 million, which translates to a 3 percentage point negative gross margin impact. 
Our supply chain team has been taking extraordinary actions to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging global environment. Global freight costs for virtually all modalities of delivery across our supply chain continue to escalate. Impacts include higher global shipping cost per kilo, a shift in modality from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers in order to meet customer commitments. We expect premium freight costs to abate once component supply and freight capacity improves. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. The pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for more digital health care experience. We entered Q3 with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see broad-based robust demand across virtually every dimension of our business. 
This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q3 guide and substantially raise our full year outlook. In Q3, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 21% and 25% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage from the prior year. It also assumes approximately $45 million of premium freight expense, which is $37 million higher than last year. We are also experiencing higher product component costs, which we expect to largely offset with recently announced price increases. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10. 
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 23% and 25%, which reflects our increasing optimism for strong growth in the second half of the year despite significant industry supply chain constraints for certain product components as well as transportation bottlenecks. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
Despite our significantly increased expectation for transitory premium freight charges that we just highlighted, we are maintaining our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and gross margin expansion from the prior year. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year due to increased profitability. 
Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. Note that our outlook does not include any projected results from the pending acquisition of Fetch Robotics. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. 
Slide 11 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. 
We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and machine vision. 
Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end markets, which demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. 
A large European postal service will be deploying approximately 80,000 TC57s to their carriers. Continuing a long-standing relationship, they are upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service. 
We are also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our ET56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process. This solution will also improve the customer experience by providing advanced notification of delivery. 
Large public sector hospital system in the U.K. is utilizing our mobile computers, printers and wrist bands to enable real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and ensure safe and efficient care. This customer is using our solutions for specimen tracking, patient monitoring and blood transfusions in emergency and operating rooms. Their employees also use our mobile computers for physical security access. 
A regional U.S. supermarket operator recently decided to implement our Reflexis workforce management tool for labor scheduling and employee self-service to more efficiently manage their resources across more than 100 locations. This solution also frees up their associates to focus more on customer service versus administrative tasks. 
More broadly in retail, the sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping requires retailers to deliver goods in a timely manner and make them available for pickup when promised. To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. 
Slide 13 highlights significant recent investments, we are making in advance -- to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision into warehouse and in manufacturing. 
In May, we announced the launch of our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions to increase efficiency and quality inspection in our customer's operations. We complemented this product launch with the acquisition of Adaptive Vision, whose software enables customers to easily build machine vision and deep learning applications. We are excited about our opportunity to penetrate this high-growth, fragmented market, and we are actively recruiting channel partners to scale the business. 
In July, we announced our intent to acquire Fetch Robotics, which has the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry, powered by a cloud software platform that can be deployed stand-alone or integrated with warehouse management systems. Our vision is to orchestrate both robots and technology-equipped frontline workers through software in the cloud to optimize material transport and order fulfillment workflows. 
As a venture investment, Fetch has been a trusted partner to Zebra, and we are excited about the prospects for our combined businesses. 
In closing, we are confident in our growth prospects given the momentum we are experiencing in the business and our heightened pace of innovation. We are energized by our vibrant core markets as well as the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

Some components are impacted much more than others, but it's a much larger number of components that we can have working than we would in a normal quarter. 
But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations and there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time so to ensure we get as much available product to provide to our customers as we can. 
We did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. And I said, despite these shortages and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full year outlook that we announced today."

So maybe if you take us back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks because there's really 3 different areas in terms of -- in the incremental cost. One, which we've seen earlier in the year, and we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestions around the supply side of it. That's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything, ocean has gone up, air rates have stabilized. 
In addition, because of the global supply constraints, along with the increased global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners, along with shipping a higher percentage of printing, in particular, via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory costs from Q2 into the second half. 
In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, in particular, for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID that have further constrained supply. 
So as we see today, you're expecting the impacts to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. 
So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's 2 things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter."

And to the previous question, we take extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy very strong demand in a supply-constrained environment. 
The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID, and we don't see any abatement in those trends. They're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing, digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example in retail of the retail vertical. Most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. 
We did see double-digit growth in all regions as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our 4 main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium-sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely partly -- to a large degree, driven by our small, medium-sized customers. And that was partly, I think, a result of pent-up demand, but we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. 
And based on this performance, I do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. Our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. Joe?"

When it comes to the backlog and the pipeline, it is very strong as you're seeing. And what I can underscore what Anders was saying, this pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. 
And we also are enjoying -- because customers are aware of the supply shortages, we're enjoying good pipeline visibility. Our customers are working with us to give us that visibility far in advance, and that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year."

This is more on the Sense side of the Sense-Analyze-Act framework, but it helps us provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on. 
This is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. It's a multibillion-dollar market that our new portfolio then can address. Although we're not addressing the entire market on day 1, but we are continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities that we can go after a bigger and bigger part of the market, and [ be ready for folks ] in initially mostly on the fixed industrial scanning market. 
Our value proposition, we believe, is very strong, and the focus is on the ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are, we believe, 2 strong differentiators that we have. 
The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the, say, the cameras that we -- and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in machine vision, or fixed industrial scanning, or incorporate machine vision and fixed industrial scanning into their workflows. 
And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time. And we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering.

The first was -- last year, we took some actions mid-year around salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as a lower incentive comp as we're obviously below our plans and targets for the year. So those 2 alone drive a significant increase year-on-year, along with the full year of Reflexis in the P&L, and starting to, again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary cost increases. 
So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter."

If you look at the market share table there, there's 1 or 2 players that have reasonable share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players. We are entering the market, say, primarily through our -- or initially with our fixed industrial scanning portfolio, which is the closest to our core competencies and the use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say, on the capabilities, both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market. 
Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right? If you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation and the value add comes from the software.

And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry-leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains. 
But there's more to it than that. We specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease-of-use value proposition that's critical to these customers, how easy is it to use and to deploy. And that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win, which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. 
All of these solutions are deployed through partners for us. We're a very partner-centric company, as you know.

But first, we haven't closed on the acquisition yet, but we are certainly excited about it. We have worked with Fetch as a venture investment for quite some time. So we believe we understand the market, we understand the team, and we see great opportunities to leverage the -- Fetch's broad portfolio of AMRs. They have the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. And they have a very strong, very capable cloud-based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots. 
And then here at Zebra, we have been more focused on technology enabled, the workers in warehouses. And by combining those 2 to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers, we think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. 
Fetch has say, initially been mostly focused on the kind of the contains market. So more of movement of goods, but we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also. And here is another area where I think our strength that we have in our go-to-market organization, I'll ask Joe to comment on this also, will augment as well.

So this means that we can take advantage of the orchestration between the 2, and there's really no one else in the market that can do that to the extent that we can. And as a result, we're taking this strong platform capability that Fetch has with robots that can go across a broader range of use cases than anyone else and can deliver products with safety and speed that no one else can and combining it with the orchestration of humans to achieve overall productivity improvements that are unequaled.

So our efforts in health care continues to expand into new areas. 
It's also expanding geographically. So the win we talked about today was in Europe. And I think here also the paid health care patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities also. They are seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on health care providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients.

Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44%, or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. 
Despite ongoing industry-wide supply chain challenges, our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers, both direct and through our distribution channel. 
Similar to Q1, we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. 
Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. 
We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. We also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our improved 2021 outlook."

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. 
Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 51.2%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 35.1%, driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software, along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as customers recover from the pandemic. 
We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across subregions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20%, led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continued its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all subregions with sales increasing 79%. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins and contribution from our recent high-margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. 
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx while prioritizing high-return investments in the business. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6%, a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. 
In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our machine vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. In addition, we also repurchased $25 million of Zebra shares. 
Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q2 at a modest 0.6x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which affords flexibility to invest in attractive business acquisitions. 
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the global pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. For the second half of the year, we now expect the year-on-year unfavorable impact from these items to be approximately $85 million, which translates to a 3 percentage point negative gross margin impact. 
Our supply chain team has been taking extraordinary actions to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging global environment. Global freight costs for virtually all modalities of delivery across our supply chain continue to escalate. Impacts include higher global shipping cost per kilo, a shift in modality from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers in order to meet customer commitments. We expect premium freight costs to abate once component supply and freight capacity improves. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. The pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for more digital health care experience. We entered Q3 with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see broad-based robust demand across virtually every dimension of our business. 
This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong Q3 guide and substantially raise our full year outlook. In Q3, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 21% and 25% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage from the prior year. It also assumes approximately $45 million of premium freight expense, which is $37 million higher than last year. We are also experiencing higher product component costs, which we expect to largely offset with recently announced price increases. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10. 
For the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 23% and 25%, which reflects our increasing optimism for strong growth in the second half of the year despite significant industry supply chain constraints for certain product components as well as transportation bottlenecks. This outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
Despite our significantly increased expectation for transitory premium freight charges that we just highlighted, we are maintaining our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and gross margin expansion from the prior year. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year due to increased profitability. 
Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. Note that our outlook does not include any projected results from the pending acquisition of Fetch Robotics. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. 
Slide 11 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. 
We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. 
With our innovative solutions, our customers' associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and machine vision. 
Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end markets, which demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. 
A large European postal service will be deploying approximately 80,000 TC57s to their carriers. Continuing a long-standing relationship, they are upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service. 
We are also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our ET56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process. This solution will also improve the customer experience by providing advanced notification of delivery. 
Large public sector hospital system in the U.K. is utilizing our mobile computers, printers and wrist bands to enable real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and ensure safe and efficient care. This customer is using our solutions for specimen tracking, patient monitoring and blood transfusions in emergency and operating rooms. Their employees also use our mobile computers for physical security access. 
A regional U.S. supermarket operator recently decided to implement our Reflexis workforce management tool for labor scheduling and employee self-service to more efficiently manage their resources across more than 100 locations. This solution also frees up their associates to focus more on customer service versus administrative tasks. 
More broadly in retail, the sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping requires retailers to deliver goods in a timely manner and make them available for pickup when promised. To address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in Zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. 
Slide 13 highlights significant recent investments, we are making in advance -- to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision into warehouse and in manufacturing. 
In May, we announced the launch of our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions to increase efficiency and quality inspection in our customer's operations. We complemented this product launch with the acquisition of Adaptive Vision, whose software enables customers to easily build machine vision and deep learning applications. We are excited about our opportunity to penetrate this high-growth, fragmented market, and we are actively recruiting channel partners to scale the business. 
In July, we announced our intent to acquire Fetch Robotics, which has the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry, powered by a cloud software platform that can be deployed stand-alone or integrated with warehouse management systems. Our vision is to orchestrate both robots and technology-equipped frontline workers through software in the cloud to optimize material transport and order fulfillment workflows. 
As a venture investment, Fetch has been a trusted partner to Zebra, and we are excited about the prospects for our combined businesses. 
In closing, we are confident in our growth prospects given the momentum we are experiencing in the business and our heightened pace of innovation. We are energized by our vibrant core markets as well as the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

Some components are impacted much more than others, but it's a much larger number of components that we can have working than we would in a normal quarter. 
But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations and there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time so to ensure we get as much available product to provide to our customers as we can. 
We did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. And I said, despite these shortages and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full year outlook that we announced today."

So maybe if you take us back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks because there's really 3 different areas in terms of -- in the incremental cost. One, which we've seen earlier in the year, and we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestions around the supply side of it. That's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything, ocean has gone up, air rates have stabilized. 
In addition, because of the global supply constraints, along with the increased global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners, along with shipping a higher percentage of printing, in particular, via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory costs from Q2 into the second half. 
In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, in particular, for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID that have further constrained supply. 
So as we see today, you're expecting the impacts to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. 
So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's 2 things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter."

And to the previous question, we take extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy very strong demand in a supply-constrained environment. 
The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID, and we don't see any abatement in those trends. They're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing, digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example in retail of the retail vertical. Most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. 
We did see double-digit growth in all regions as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our 4 main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium-sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely partly -- to a large degree, driven by our small, medium-sized customers. And that was partly, I think, a result of pent-up demand, but we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth.

When it comes to the backlog and the pipeline, it is very strong as you're seeing. And what I can underscore what Anders was saying, this pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see.

Our value proposition, we believe, is very strong, and the focus is on the ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are, we believe, 2 strong differentiators that we have. 
The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the, say, the cameras that we -- and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in machine vision, or fixed industrial scanning, or incorporate machine vision and fixed industrial scanning into their workflows. 
And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time. And we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering. And we felt that Adaptive Vision had a very attractive solution, very strong solution, and there was a nice fit with Zebra."

So I think if you -- from an OpEx perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple of major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. 
The first was -- last year, we took some actions mid-year around salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as a lower incentive comp as we're obviously below our plans and targets for the year. So those 2 alone drive a significant increase year-on-year, along with the full year of Reflexis in the P&L, and starting to, again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary cost increases. 
So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter."

But I think your first question was around the fixed industrial scanning, machine vision market. So we believe it's a very attractive market. It's a near adjacency to what we do. And it's quite a fragmented market. 
If you look at the market share table there, there's 1 or 2 players that have reasonable share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players. We are entering the market, say, primarily through our -- or initially with our fixed industrial scanning portfolio, which is the closest to our core competencies and the use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say, on the capabilities, both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market. 
Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right? If you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation and the value add comes from the software. And we certainly expect that to be the case here also. So we are investing in building more of that software capability. That division was an inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. 
From a -- we should also not underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market. I mentioned earlier, I think, that we are putting in a specialized track in our PartnerConnect reseller program to specifically address recruiting fixed industrial scanning, machine vision partners to help accelerate that growth.

So you know that we have the fixed industrial scanning and the machine vision parts of this. 
The fixed industrial scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. And we're, of course, translating that technically: to succeed in the machine vision part, that's where the software piece is essential. And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry-leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains. 
But there's more to it than that. We specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease-of-use value proposition that's critical to these customers, how easy is it to use and to deploy. And that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win, which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. 
All of these solutions are deployed through partners for us. We're a very partner-centric company, as you know. And that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the machine vision space. And making our software easy to use is a value proposition, not just to the end users, but to those partners specifically. So hopefully, that's helpful."

So we believe we understand the market, we understand the team, and we see great opportunities to leverage the -- Fetch's broad portfolio of AMRs. They have the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. And they have a very strong, very capable cloud-based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots. 
And then here at Zebra, we have been more focused on technology enabled, the workers in warehouses. And by combining those 2 to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers, we think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. 
Fetch has say, initially been mostly focused on the kind of the contains market. So more of movement of goods, but we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also.

So this means that we can take advantage of the orchestration between the 2, and there's really no one else in the market that can do that to the extent that we can.

We look at our R&D investments across a number of horizons, you can say, our investments in our core that would have a very short-term return kind of the near adjacencies, which would have a little bit longer return, say, a couple of years, 2, 3 years, and then more innovative new solutions, more of the enterprise asset intelligence type of solutions here which will have a little longer-term payback as they're more ground-up innovations. 
In many areas, let's say, you mentioned Fetch specifically, we developed our own robots with SmartSight before. So there's certainly been a way for us to both learn the industry, but there's also attractive ways for us to leverage those investments across. So when we do make acquisitions, we see that as a great way for us to augment our own internal programs and drive us into new high-growth adjacencies where we can make a difference. Did that answer your question?"

I think across all our verticals first. I mean, COVID has accelerated the secular trends that we talked about around our -- all our end markets are driving solutions that help to digitize and automate their workflows and empower frontline workers to be connected and optimally kind of utilized. 
Each of our primary vertical markets grew double digits in the second quarter, and we continue to invest in expanding into each of these ones. Specifically for health care, I'd say we saw health care -- our health care markets, they started in more acute care, but it's been moving into other areas like outpatient, remote patient care, COVID testing, vaccine distribution. So our efforts in health care continues to expand into new areas. 
It's also expanding geographically. So the win we talked about today was in Europe. And I think here also the paid health care patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities also. They are seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on health care providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients. And I'll say here, our purpose-built devices and solutions are critical for health care providers, not only to improve the patient journey but also to drive greater productivity for the health care providers."

One is that -- we know that health care systems, depending on where in the world you are, this is in a different stage, have pulled back on some of their spending because they didn't have income from the elective procedures that they usually enjoyed. And as we come out of the pandemic, we see more of that income returning to for-profit hospitals and then their ability to spend on these solutions returns as well. And we've seen that. 
And the international growth is another big dimension. Anders mentioned the European piece, but we also see significant interest in different parts of Asia that we hadn't seen to that extent before. So they are 2 more growth vectors that we expect."

But it's great to see that we have this diversity in the business across our main 4 verticals and some other newer ones coming up. 
But in Q2 here, manufacturing, which was our fastest-growing vertical, manufacturing was the one that was the hardest hit by COVID-19 and the macro was a bit tougher going into that with tariffs and other things. But the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads-up displays and the need to track and trace [ workflow, important ] sourcing components at sub-suppliers through assembly, all the way through distribution is putting -- providing great opportunities for us. 
So all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in Q2."

There are partners who we currently have who are also in the fixed industrial scanning, machine vision space that we are obviously having a great -- already have a relationship with and with easy expansion to add our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision capabilities to their portfolio, but also recruiting new partners that are not necessarily Zebra partners today, but are strong in that space. 
And we've seen good interest and response rates for them -- from them. And I think they have been impressed with our solutions and they see how we can add value to them.

And as we were designing this go-to-market approach, this -- we spent a lot of time on this. 
First, we created a dedicated track in our PartnerConnect program, which is very important to serve the needs of these particular partners. A percentage of our current partners are also machine vision distributors and sellers. I would estimate that that's a small percentage. 
The majority of machine vision partners we do need to create -- we do need to recruit, I'm sorry. And we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already. We have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force. And that's because of what we were talking about earlier that we've designed the product with a particular value proposition geared towards partners. 
We wanted it to make easy for those partners to deploy and sell these solutions. We think that's critical to success, and that's essential in how we've designed the product. So we're very pleased with both the number of partners we've already been able to recruit and the pipeline of additional partners that we have that is interested in selling our product."

Our customers are prioritizing investment in our solutions to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand global economy. We realized double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA. Favorable business mix and higher service and software margins enabled us to expand our gross profit margin despite escalating freight costs. Our teams have been diligently leveraging alternative modalities of transport and expediting shipments to mitigate the impact of continued industry-wide supply chain challenges.

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 23.2% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes",760,"Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 23.2% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. 
Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 12.1%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 27.9%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. Note that we also realized double-digit growth across services and software. 
All 4 regions grew double digits. North America sales increased 14%, with particular strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. EMEA sales increased 39% and with strong growth across all major solutions offerings, particularly mobile computing. APAC sales grew 17%, with strength across most geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 41%, continuing with strong recovery with double-digit growth in all major offerings. 
Adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 45.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and software margins. These benefits were partially offset by significant premium freight charges, which we will discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 30 basis points as we continue to prioritize high-return investments in the business. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.55, $1.28 or 39% year-over-year increase which benefited from lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $798 million of free cash flow through the first 9 months of 2021. This was $316 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a modest 0.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. 
In the first 9 months of 2021, we invested more than $300 million to acquire Fetch Robotics and Adaptive Vision to advance our intelligent automation solutions in manufacturing and the warehouse. We made $24 million of venture investments in 4 portfolio companies. In addition, we made $38 million of capital expenditures and $25 million of share repurchases. 
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on China imports. Our supply chain team continues to take extraordinary measures to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging environment. 
Global freight costs are elevated for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain, this includes higher shipping cost per kilo, a significant shift from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers to meet customer commitments. 
In Q3 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $44 million, which were $36 million higher than the prior year. For Q4, we now expect approximately $55 million of premium freight costs based on the higher spot rates we are seeing in the market, which translates to a 4 percentage point negative gross margin impact. We expect premium freight costs to abate as component supply and freight capacity improves. 
Let's now turn to our outlook. Our robust sales pipeline and strong order backlog is supported by broad-based demand for our solutions as enterprises look to automate their operations to satisfy increasing consumer expectations. Despite extended lead times and uneven inventory availability, we expect fourth quarter adjusted net sales to increase between 8% and 12% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 2 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. 
We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly higher than 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to significantly higher premium freight expense, which I discussed earlier. We are also experiencing product component inflation, which we expect to largely offset with price increases that became effective in September. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.50.  
We have increased our free cash flow outlook to be at least $950 million for the year due to higher-than-expected profitability. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets with spotlights on our acquisition of antuit and our health care vertical."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate supply chain challenges. 
Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services. By transforming workflows Zebra's customers can address complex operational challenges to achieve higher levels of performance. By closely collaborating with our partners and customers, we help businesses across a variety of end markets to implement solutions that maximize their return on investment. 
Human labor is a scarce resource. Our innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as machine vision, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence. 
In October, we acquired antuit for approximately $145 million to further advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This high-margin Software as a Service business generated sales of approximately $27 million in 2020, nearly doubling over a 3-year period. 
Slide 12 illustrates how the AI-powered demand forecasting solution ensures that its retail and consumer product customers have the right inventory at the right time at the optimal price, whether it's fulfilled through online ordering or in-store shopping. antuit's cutting-edge offering complements our suite of workflow software solutions, including Reflexis, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, WorkforceConnect and SmartCount, which works together to increase the performance of labor and inventory across the integrated supply chain. 
Our growing software suite will help our customers break down silos between planning and execution, giving them a competitive advantage that can increase revenue and margins as they navigate the increased demands of omnichannel fulfillment. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight a few recent key wins across our end markets that demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity and service levels. 
In retail, Zebra enabling improved execution of omnichannel fulfillment as more consumers shop online. We recently secured our largest win to date in India, providing TC21 mobile computers and printers to help a local retailer compete more effectively against its larger omnichannel and e-commerce global competitors. We are also enabling a Japanese supermarket chain to provide an improved customer experience with our EC55 personal shopping mobile computing solution. 
Over the next several quarters, a leading home improvement retailer will be deploying 90,000 TC52 mobile computers to a broader number of associates in their stores. Key use cases include item locationing, best-in-class long-range imaging, mobile point-of-sale and e-commerce functionality. Competitive differentiators for this win included our seamless network connectivity, best-in-class noise cancellation and enterprise leading durability. 
Our mobile computers will also have full desktop functionality when inserted into workstation cradles. This retailer is also deploying our Workforce Connect Software-as-a-Service solution, which enables associate-to-associate instant collaboration as well as associated-to-group and store-to-store communication. 
A leading North American transportation and logistics company is deploying 9,000 TC77 mobile computers to their truck drivers for loading and delivery use cases. This solution will increase productivity, improve inventory accuracy, log driving times and track regulatory compliance. 
Turning to Slide 14, we highlight how health care providers are using Zebra solutions to digitize and automate the patient journey and address labor challenges. Our recently published Vision study highlights that 95% of decision-makers expect to increase spending in health care IT and clinical mobility in the next year. We have some exciting recent strategic wins that demonstrate our value proposition. 
We recently secured a takeaway win of a leading U.S. health care provider with more than 150 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care. This customer selected Zebra to provide a multiyear rollout of 85,000 scanners for a wide range of use cases, including bedside nursing, surgery, pharmacy and inventory management. They also recognized our unique software tools that enable real-time event tracking to prioritize patient care. 
A large Eastern European public hospital system recently placed in order to provide 19,000 TC25 mobile computers to nurses across 100 hospitals. Hospitals are facing labor shortages made worse by the pandemic, which puts patient safety at risk. Zebra's solutions, including printers and wrist bands, reduces the administrative burden on the nursing staff and allows for more efficient patient care. Our value proposition to this customer also includes real-time tracking of costs of supplies, equipment and medicine. 
Additionally, Zebra is growing our long-standing relationship with GE Healthcare, whose solution, Encompass, utilizes Zebra's Bluetooth beacon technology for medical equipment asset management. This solution improves asset utilization and prevents unnecessary equipment replacement purchases. Caregivers also benefit by reduced time searching for medical equipment, which can increase time dedicated to patient care. 
In closing, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving Zebra's business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for a more digital health care experience. Our core markets are vibrant and our prospects to scale newer expansion markets are bright. 
We are steadily navigating through significant transitory industry-wide supply chain challenges. That said, we continue to be as excited as ever about our long-term profitable growth prospects. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

But also just in terms of the portfolio and fit, so if I'm a customer, what augmented capabilities will you be able to deliver with the software platform given you've got other software adjacencies and  hardware opportunities to deliver a solution versus what the portfolio -- or rather what antuit would have done as a pure stand-alone business?"

I'll try to go through and give you some insights to each of those points. But first, this helps us in our -- to augment our solutions around improving retail store execution for our customers as well as for consumer products companies. It is very synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. And we talked about our sense, analyze, act framework here, and this is very much around the analyze and act part of this, enabling our customers to sense what's happening in the real world, analyze this information and act on it in real time. 
The solution that antuit offers is a demand-sensing solution, it's called, that's -- but that they take in lots of different data feeds, anything from in-store sales to weather, social media and use that to determine basically what demand trends will be. And they can be very quick and do this much better than, say, traditional models. If you take an example, like when COVID happened, Intuit's algorithms were able to better and quicker adjust to this new environment. And it's very, say, synergistic with our other offerings, particularly, say, on the software side, where say -- take Reflexis, where antuit's insights will generate actions for our Reflexis task management solution, so they can be to go and replenish something. Move inventory from the back of store to the front of store or other parts of the supply chain. 
So it is very much kind of works synergistically with our broader software solution as well as with our devices. So our mobile computers will generate insights that antuit can analyze and put into its AI algorithms to drive better insights from. And with this broader set of solutions, we position Zebra to be more of a strategic solutions partner to our customers. And we have access to more executives or more customers and more executive level people at our customers than antuit would have individually. So therefore, we think that this fits very well with our broader strategy."

If you think about how the fourth quarter is progressing, both in terms of the realization of some of the pricing actions you've taken then also you've got on the cost side, it's dynamic and presumably changing on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. So if you think about where you likely end the quarter, once all that rolls through versus the full quarter outlook you gave, I think it was above 21% for the quarter.

So 4 points, that's the premium freight, but offset by favorable business mix as well as improved service margin as well as improvement just in the underlying product margin. And as you mentioned, we have raised prices to offset the component pricing, so the unit price. 
I think -- so that's something we're continuing to monitor and assess is how the transitory impacts play out. I would say from a logistics and freight perspective, we do expect that to moderate through the first half of 2022. But I'd say it's something we're managing day to day, week to week.

And so if you look at the broader backdrop, demand has ramped very fast over the past year, and we have now prioritized meeting our customer needs and commitments. And while we are not always able to meet our traditional lead times due to these industry-wide supply chain challenges, we have been working with our partners and customers to make sure that we can deliver very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. And I'd say based on feedback from our customers and partners, we've been managing this better than our competition. 
Specifically for how to secure parts, looking at the semiconductor industry shortages that has impacted the availability and pricing of some parts more than others, or some of our devices than more than others, this is a highly dynamic environment. And we get -- so we sort out and get good news on some parts. Next day, we get some more challenging news on other parts. So it is kind of very much of a dynamic environment for us. But I'd say our teams have been working very well. Done an exceptional job of working all angles to figure out how to mitigate these issues. 
Starting with -- we've been built more resiliency in our supply chain by putting in new assembly plants across Southeast Asia, so we're less dependent on any particular plant. And in Q3, for instance, we had to move volume between plants based on COVID outbreaks. So that was a great way for us to leverage that. We've also worked really hard to engage with our semiconductor suppliers to make sure that we get our fair share, so we get proper allocations of parts. And we're having a large part of our engineering team working on redesigning our devices to qualify new alternative components that are not as exposed to or limited with supply. 
So we're doing all of these things to ensure that we can meet our customer needs as well as possible here. But as I said, it's a dynamic environment. It's difficult to predict how exactly it's going to play out. But based on our conversations with our suppliers, I'd say, we expect a gradual improvement by mid-2022 on the component side."

And we're helping our customers to digitize and automate their operations. And the core business is very vibrant. And we're very excited about the adjacent expansion opportunities that we have. 
Now specifically for printing, we had a very solid -- we delivered a very solid growth across the regions in printing. Printing was up across most of its portfolio. We have particular strength in manufacturing, which tends to deploy mostly tabletop printers. We also saw strong run rate or smaller business through our channel. But it's fair to say that printing was disproportionately impacted by supply chain challenges. And that was -- that includes both component issues, but also that our main assembly plant in Southeast Asia had to almost shut down based on COVID, and we had to shift a lot of the volume from Vietnam to China. So that took some capacity out of the quarter. 
But it still was a very good quarter for printer. We could have done probably a little bit better, but we still believe that we continue to gain share. Certainly, year-to-date, we gained a lot of share in printing. And also in the AIT segment here, we had very strong growth in supplies across all regions, and that includes our Temptime portfolio.

Obviously, demand has been strong and very broad-based. So that certainly helps on the overall demand profile. But I don't think that the -- seasonality has meaningfully changed and Joe can comment on that in a second. 
On the other part, on health care. Health care has been our fastest-growing vertical. If you look over the last several years and we would expect it to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical, not necessarily every quarter but over a longer period of time. And we have built up a -- we said, first, we're leveraging our traditional sales team, but we have a dedicated health care sales team within our sales organization and we have largely dedicated health care partners. 
If you take somebody who's an expert in manufacturing and send them to a hospital, the language is different, the solutions are different.

And so our reflection of their seasonality to sort of pull forward in that regard. 
In terms of health care and the go-to-market that we use there, as Anders said, yes, we have specialized partners in those areas that we have been building out over the last few years. Two other things I think characterize our go-to-market and routes to market, in particular, one is we have a higher-than-average investment of our own resources. We have learned and determined that being present in those hospitals, which is, of course, a more fragmented customer seat -- customer set is important. And therefore, we have made more investments in our own resources in those areas, and we're more present together with our partners, of course. 
And then the second is that we've also learned that we need to expand our partner set to more, let's say, nontraditional partners, which would include, in particular, ISVs. They're very important for electronic health records that we need to form partnerships with. And OEMs, there are important OEMs that participate in this -- in the health care segment and we have formed some very strong alliances with those as well.

And we talked about how, today, roughly -- our estimate is that 1/3 of retail store associates have access to a mobile device. And when we talk to our retail customers, they certainly have an aspiration to get that to be much, much higher. 
And similarly, in health care, we did a vision study. I think it's a couple of years back now where the expectation there was to bring it from about 60% up to 95% over the next few years."

Our team delivered exceptional third quarter results that exceeded our outlook, supported by robust broad-based demand for our solutions. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 27% or 23% on an organic basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7% and a 140 basis point year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.55, a 39% increase from the prior year. And strong free cash flow.
Our customers are prioritizing investment in our solutions to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand global economy. We realized double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA. Favorable business mix and higher service and software margins enabled us to expand our gross profit margin despite escalating freight costs. Our teams have been diligently leveraging alternative modalities of transport and expediting shipments to mitigate the impact of continued industry-wide supply chain challenges.
We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our Q4 outlook."

Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 23.2% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes",760,"Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 23.2% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes.
Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 12.1%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 27.9%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. Note that we also realized double-digit growth across services and software.
All 4 regions grew double digits. North America sales increased 14%, with particular strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. EMEA sales increased 39% and with strong growth across all major solutions offerings, particularly mobile computing. APAC sales grew 17%, with strength across most geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 41%, continuing with strong recovery with double-digit growth in all major offerings.
Adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 45.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and software margins. These benefits were partially offset by significant premium freight charges, which we will discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 30 basis points as we continue to prioritize high-return investments in the business.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.55, $1.28 or 39% year-over-year increase which benefited from lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $798 million of free cash flow through the first 9 months of 2021. This was $316 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a modest 0.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility.
In the first 9 months of 2021, we invested more than $300 million to acquire Fetch Robotics and Adaptive Vision to advance our intelligent automation solutions in manufacturing and the warehouse. We made $24 million of venture investments in 4 portfolio companies. In addition, we made $38 million of capital expenditures and $25 million of share repurchases.
On Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on China imports. Our supply chain team continues to take extraordinary measures to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging environment.
Global freight costs are elevated for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. This includes higher shipping cost per kilo, a significant shift from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers to meet customer commitments. In Q3 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $44 million, which was $36 million higher than the prior year. For Q4, we now expect approximately $55 million of premium freight costs based on the higher spot rates we are seeing in the market, which translates to a 4 percentage point negative gross margin impact. We expect premium freight costs to abate as component supply and freight capacity improves.
Let's now turn to our outlook. Our robust sales pipeline and strong order backlog is supported by broad-based demand for our solutions as enterprises look to automate their operations to satisfy increasing consumer expectations. Despite extended lead times and uneven inventory availability, we expect fourth quarter adjusted net sales to increase between 8% and 12% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 2 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.
We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly higher than 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to significantly higher premium freight expense, which I discussed earlier. We are also experiencing product component inflation, which we expect to largely offset with price increases that became effective in September. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.50.
We have increased our free cash flow outlook to be at least $950 million for the year due to higher-than-expected profitability. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9.
With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in new and existing markets with spotlights on our acquisition of Antuit and our health care vertical."

I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate supply chain challenges.
Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services. By transforming workflows Zebra's customers can address complex operational challenges to achieve higher levels of performance.
By closely collaborating with our partners and customers, we help businesses across a variety of end markets to implement solutions that maximize their return on investment.
Human labor is a scarce resource. Our innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as machine vision, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence.
In October, we acquired Antuit for approximately $145 million to further advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This high-margin Software as a Service business generated sales of approximately $27 million in 2020, nearly doubling over a 3-year period.  
Slide 12 illustrates how the AI-powered demand forecasting solution ensures that its retail and consumer product customers have the right inventory at the right time at the optimal price, whether it's fulfilled through online ordering or in-store shopping. Antuit's cutting-edge offering complements our suite of workflow software solutions, including Reflexis, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, Workforce Connect and SmartCount, which works together to increase the performance of labor and inventory across the integrated supply chain.
Our growing software suite will help our customers break down silos between planning and execution, giving them a competitive advantage that can increase revenue and margins as they navigate the increased demands of omnichannel fulfillment.
Now turning to Slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight a few recent key wins across our end markets that demonstrate how Zebra solutions are improving productivity and service levels.
In retail, Zebra is enabling improved execution of omnichannel fulfillment as more consumers shop online. We recently secured our largest win to date in India, providing TC21 mobile computers and printers to help a local retailer compete more effectively against its larger omnichannel and e-commerce global competitors. We are also enabling a Japanese supermarket chain to provide an improved customer experience with our EC55 personal shopping mobile computing solution.
Over the next several quarters, a leading home improvement retailer will be deploying 90,000 TC52 mobile computers to a broader number of associates in their stores. Key use cases include item locationing, best-in-class long-range imaging, mobile point-of-sale and e-commerce functionality. Competitive differentiators for this win included our seamless network connectivity, best-in-class noise cancellation and enterprise leading durability.
Our mobile computers will also have full desktop functionality when inserted into workstation cradles. This retailer is also deploying our Workforce Connect Software-as-a-Service solution, which enables associate-to-associate instant collaboration as well as associated-to-group and's store-to-store communication.
A leading North American transportation and logistics company is deploying 9,000 TC77 mobile computers to their truck drivers for loading and delivery use cases. This solution will increase productivity, improve inventory accuracy, log driving times and track regulatory compliance.
Turning to Slide 14, we highlight how health care providers are using Zebra solutions to digitize and automate the patient journey and address labor challenges. Our recently published Vision study highlights that 95% of decision-makers expect to increase spending in health care IT and clinical mobility in the next year. We have some exciting recent strategic wins that demonstrate our value proposition.
We recently secured a takeaway win of a leading U.S. health care provider with more than 150 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care. This customer selected Zebra to provide a multiyear rollout of 85,000 scanners for a wide range of use cases, including bedside nursing, surgery, pharmacy and inventory management. They also recognized our unique software tools that enable real-time event tracking to prioritize patient care.
A large Eastern European public hospital system recently placed in order to provide 19,000 TC25 mobile computers to nurses across 100 hospitals. Hospitals are facing labor shortages made worse by the pandemic, which puts patient safety at risk. Zebra's solutions, including printers and wrist bands, reduces the administrative burden on the nursing staff and allows for more efficient patient care. Our value proposition to this customer also includes real-time tracking of costs of supplies, equipment and medicine.
Additionally, Zebra is growing our long-standing relationship with GE Healthcare, whose solution, Encompass, utilizes Zebra's Bluetooth beacon technology for medical equipment asset management. This solution improves asset utilization and prevents unnecessary equipment replacement purchases. Caregivers also benefit by reduced time searching for medical equipments, which can increase time dedicated to patient care.
In closing, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving Zebra's business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for a more digital health care experience. Our core markets are vibrant and our prospects to scale newer expansion markets are bright.
We are steadily navigating through significant transitory industry-wide supply chain challenges. That said, we continue to be as excited as ever about our long-term profitable growth prospects.
Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike."

Anders, I wanted to start on your Antuit acquisition. Wondered if you could highlight a couple of ways in which it might be synergistic with your portfolio. And I really -- I had 2 buckets in mind.  First just in terms of scale, you've got more robust go-to-market capabilities, more robust R&D dollars you can put against it. So what would you highlight for us there? But also just in terms of the portfolio and fit, so if I'm a customer, what augmented capabilities will you be able to deliver with the software platform given you've got other software adjacencies and hardware opportunities to deliver a solution versus what the portfolio -- or rather what Antuit would have done as a pure stand-alone business?"

I'll try to go through and give you some insights to each of those points. But the first, this helps us in our -- to augment our solutions around improving retail store execution for our customers as well as for consumer products companies. It is very synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. And we talked about our sense, analyze, act framework here, and this is very much around the analyze and act part of this, enabling our customers to sense what's happening in the real world, analyze this information and act on it in real time.
The solution that Antuit offers is a demand-sensing solution, it's called, that's -- but that they take in lots of different data feeds, anything from in-store sales to weather, social media and use that to determine basically what demand trends will be. And they can be very quick and do this much better than, say, traditional models. If you take an example, like when COVID happened, Antuit's algorithms were able to better and quicker adjust to this new environment. And it's very, say, synergistic with our other offerings, particularly, say, on the software side, where say -- take Reflexis, where Antuit's insights will generate actions for our Reflexis task management solution, so they can be to go and replenish something, move inventory from the back of store to the front of store or other parts of the supply chain.
So it is very much kind of works synergistically with our broader software solution as well as with our devices. So our mobile computers will generate insights that Antuit can analyze and put into its AI algorithms to drive better insights from. And with this broader set of solutions, we position Zebra to be more of a strategic solutions partner to our customers. And we have access to more executives or -- more customers and more executive level people at our customers than Antuit would have individually. So therefore, we think that this fits very well with our broader strategy."

If you think about how the fourth quarter is progressing, both in terms of the realization of some of the pricing actions you've taken, then also you've got on the cost side, it's dynamic and presumably changing on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. So if you think about where you likely end the quarter, once all that rolls through versus the full quarter outlook you gave, I think it was above 21% for the quarter.

So 4 points, that's the premium freight, but offset by favorable business mix as well as improved service margin as well as improvement just in the underlying product margin. And as you mentioned, we have raised prices to offset the component pricing, so the unit price.
I think -- so that's something we're continuing to monitor and assess is how the transitory impacts play out. I would say from a logistics and freight perspective, we do expect that to moderate through the first half of 2022. But I'd say it's something we're managing day to day, week to week. And we'll see how the quarters play out in terms of when we start to see a meaningful benefit from where we're at today."

And so if you look at the broader backdrop, demand has ramped very fast over the past year, and we have now prioritized meeting our customer needs and commitments. And while we are not always able to meet our traditional lead times due to these industry-wide supply chain challenges, we have been working with our partners and customers to make sure that we can deliver very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. And I'd say based on feedback from our customers and partners, we've been managing this better than our competition.
Specifically for how to secure parts, looking at the semiconductor industry shortages that has impacted the availability and pricing of some parts more than others, or some of our devices than more than others, this is a highly dynamic environment. And we get -- so we sort out and get good news on some parts. Next day, we get some more challenging news on other parts. So it is kind of very much of a dynamic environment for us. But I'd say our teams have been working very well. Done an exceptional job of working all angles to figure out how to mitigate these issues.
Starting with -- we've been built more resiliency in our supply chain by putting in new assembly plants across Southeast Asia, so we're less dependent on any particular plant. And in Q3, for instance, we had to move volume between plants based on COVID outbreaks. So that was a great way for us to leverage that. We've also worked really hard to engage with our semiconductor suppliers to make sure that we get our fair share, so we get proper allocations of parts. And we're having a large part of our engineering team working on redesigning our devices to qualify new alternative components that are not as exposed to or limited with supply.
So we're doing all of these things to ensure that we can meet our customer needs as well as possible here. But as I said, it's a dynamic environment. It's difficult to predict how exactly it's going to play out. But based on our conversations with our suppliers, I'd say, we expect a gradual improvement by mid-2022 on the component side."

And we're helping our customers to digitize and automate their operations. And the core business is very vibrant. And we're very excited about the adjacent expansion opportunities that we have.
Now specifically for printing, we had a very solid -- we delivered a very solid growth across the regions in printing. Printing was up across most of its portfolio. We have particular strength in manufacturing, which tends to deploy mostly tabletop printers. We also saw strong run rate or smaller business through our channel. But it's fair to say that printing was disproportionately impacted by supply chain challenges. And that was -- that includes both component issues, but also that our main assembly plant in Southeast Asia had to almost shut down based on COVID, and we had to shift a lot of the volume from Vietnam to China. So that took some capacity out of the quarter.
But it still was a very good quarter for printing. We could have done probably a little bit better, but we still believe that we continue to gain share.

I think seasonality this year has been similar to what we would normally have seen, but we had slight increases quarter-over-quarter in Q3 and into Q4. So not a huge difference from that perspective. Obviously, demand has been strong and very broad-based. So that certainly helps on the overall demand profile. But I don't think that the -- seasonality has meaningfully changed and Joe can comment on that in a second.
On the other part, on health care. Health care has been our fastest-growing vertical if you look over the last several years and we would expect it to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical, not necessarily every quarter but over a longer period of time. And we have built up a -- we said, first, we're leveraging our traditional sales team, but we have a dedicated health care sales team within our sales organization and we have largely dedicated health care partners.
If you take somebody who's an expert in manufacturing and send them to a hospital, the language is different, the solutions are different. So it really warrants to have more specialized partners, and we have a large number of specialized both regular resellers, but also ISVs and other partners to help us make sure that we have a robust go-to-market organization and capability as we can.

On the seasonality, the one additional thing we have seen is that retailers have been ordering further in advance, right? They're seeing, of course, the shortages that are -- that exist in the supply chain and are working with us to anticipate those. So that means that we can plan our supply to them further in advance. And so our reflection of their seasonality to sort of pull forward in that regard.
In terms of health care and the go-to-market that we use there, as Anders said, yes, we have specialized partners in those areas that we have been building out over the last few years. Two other things I think characterize our go-to-market and routes to market, in particular, one is we have a higher-than-average investment of our own resources. We have learned and determined that being present in those hospitals, which is, of course, a more fragmented customer seat -- customer set is important. And therefore, we have made more investments in our own resources in those areas, and we're more present together with our partners, of course.
And then the second is that we've also learned that we need to expand our partner set to more, let's say, nontraditional partners, which would include, in particular, ISVs. They're very important ISVs for electronic health records that we need to form partnerships with. And OEMs, there are important OEMs that participate in this -- in the health care segment and we have formed some very strong alliances with those as well. And that's helped us with our growth in health care."

So we -- but with that is in a more dedicated part of the organization to make sure we have the right level of or depth of knowledge and insights.
We are doing this largely direct today, but we are also working with expanding our portfolio -- our partner portfolio here. And there's a number of other type of resellers and system integrators who are interested in working with us to be able to represent us and participate in doing implementation services. And Antuit, we specifically -- with Antuit here now, we are initially keeping the Antuit sales team somewhat separate because we want to make sure we keep the focus and dedication to that.

We've seen great demand and we've -- that has been able to drive our revenues to exceed the high end of our guidance range. And our customers are aggressively pursuing digital enterprise transformation strategies, which is causing us to basically exceed our expectations as far as revenue growth this year. We talked about the supply chain issues as being a moderator on this, but we've still been able to deliver double-digit growth across all the regions in each of our product segments.
And we continue to see strong growth from both our smaller customers as well as our large strategic accounts. And based on our performance, I clearly expect that we are continuing to take share in the industry. And we entered Q4 with a strong backlog and we have a healthy pipeline, which I think provides good visibility into 2022. Specifically for Europe, I think we saw -- Europe obviously had a fantastic quarter. So strength in nearly all the subregions of EMEA, and growth was across all our verticals with particular strength in transportation logistics, and that was driven by some very attractive large postal services' wins. And retail was also a very strong vertical for us. From a product perspective, mobile computing and services were particularly strong, while our printing business is more impacted by supply chains.
