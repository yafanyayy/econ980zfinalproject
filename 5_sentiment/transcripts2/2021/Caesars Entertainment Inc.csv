It was, by any measure, the most challenging year that we've had operationally and personally to date, the fourth quarter was no exception to that. I want to startthe",1561,"Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We are
thrilled to close the book on 2020.  It was, by any measure, the most challenging year that we've had operationally and personally to date, the fourth quarter was no exception to that. I want to start
the call by recognizing all of our frontline employees. They live through the vast majority of our employees being furloughed, then coming back into an environment where they were fearful for health and safety, fearful for what was happening at home with children or parents or grandparents or all of the above. And they came back and delivered the exceptional service that our customers are accustomed to at Caesars and operated through some
Extraordinary contact tracing changes in regulations, reopenings, closings throughout the year, and we couldn't be prouder of them. 
For the fourth quarter, we did $346 million of EBITDA. We've listened and read others calls, our cadence with similar. Almost half of our EBITDA
happened in October. And then as regulation -- restrictions tightened across the country, November and December were sequentially less than October, and we think the bottom for the business, and we'll talk about what we've seen in January and February and going forward that makes us highly confident of that. 
In Las Vegas, we did $100 million of EBITDA, adding back the Rio rent payment, which we're proud of on a
relative basis. But we know on an absolute basis, we've got a lot of wood to chop in Vegas as it reopens.  We're seeing some encouraging signs there that I'll discuss. In the regional markets in the quarter, we had significant restrictions in Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio that related to operating hours. We had closures in Illinois, Pennsylvania, that -- and the Lake Charles property from the prior
hurricane. If you exclude just the closed properties, you include everything that had the operating restrictions, our regional EBITDA margins were up about 400 basis points for the quarter. 
So still seeing through the noise, strong evidence on the cost side, that those -- that, that progress is continuing. If you look at -- when I'm speaking to investors, I'm often asked what am I missing? What is the market missing? And what I think the market is missing now is similar to what I talked about in the last quarterly call, the demand that is
coming as the world reopens and the flow-through that you should expect to see in this business post
reopening is widely underestimated by the markets. 
I see kind of across the board in the sector a view in numbers estimates out there that suggest we get back to 2019 numbers kind of sometime in '23. I'm firmly convinced that we'll be at least run rating those numbers, the first quarter that Vegas Group business is back in earnest, and that could be as early as the second half of this year. So I think there's -- there needs --  there should be a dramatic pull forward of expectations of the turn. 
And I'll give you a few examples of why I believe this to be the case.  Currently, in Las Vegas, we are at our highest level of bookings since reopening. January and February have ramped up. It's almost like a switch was flipped sometime late January, early February. Our bookings are up
20% on a month-over-month basis in the FIT and Casino segment. The -- we measure gross and net pickup. So gross pickup is how many aggregate rooms are booked in a day or a week or whatever period you're looking at. Net pickup is bookings less cancellations. 
And if you look at our gross and net bookings, 9 of our top 10 days since the pandemic reopening in Las Vegas happened in February, with Monday being the highest that we have seen to date. Importantly, the booking window is extending as well. So if you look
back to from reopening until the end of '20, it seemed like you had a lot of impulse trips, very short booking windows. What we're seeing now is almost half of our bookings are for trips that are at least 30 days out, which is about double the pace that we had in the fourth quarter. So we're extremely encouraged by that.  
If you look at our actual performance, January and February, January was well in excess of November and December, approached October in terms of EBITDA, February has been strong as well, obviously, with fewer days in the month ultimately. But if we -- as we look forward at our forward booking forecast, by mid-March, we're well into the 50s in terms of percentage occupancy midweek on the strip, and we're 95% plus on weekends. 
If you look at our group business, for the second half of the year, we've got 32% more room nights on the books for the second half of '21 than we had for the second half of '19 on the same day. Now I'll grant you that we didn't have forum convention center in the fourth quarter of '19, but you're talking about almost $200 million of room night revenue on the books for the second half of the
year for group business. 
And remember, when we talk about group business, those are the rooms that are booked for the actual event. So as those groups come and your guests
decide to come early, bring their wife, bring their families, stay a little longer, those rooms are not
included in that group room night business. So we know that there's a lot of discussion and debate and
prognostication about when the world will reopen. We're certainly heartened by all of the recent data the vaccine advances in terms of coming supply. We're heartened by Governor Sisolak in Nevada, providing a path that has us in a position where we could be hosting group business by the middle of this year in earnest. 
And so we think there's light at the end of the tunnel there. And when you look at what we're messaging to our internal operators is let's make sure that all of the cost discipline that we have found over the last year or so remains in place as business comes back. And we had kind of an anomaly
in the fourth quarter in the Tahoe Market, where California's regulations were far more stringent than Nevada. So you kind of got an early burst of demand that would sort of simulate what will happen in a reopening. 
And our team up there, John Coster and his team did a fantastic job of maintaining discipline on the cost side so that Tahoe was up 7% in gaming revenue in the fourth quarter, was up almost 60% in EBITDA, with EBITDA margins growing by over 1,100 basis points. And it's that type of view that admittedly, you don't get to see that gives me optimism. If you look anecdotally at this past Saturday night in Las Vegas, nothing particularly interesting about it. 
It was -- we were 95% occupied. So you get to see what we look like virtually full. We were 99% last
Year at higher rates. 
There was nothing particularly notable about hold or high-end play on that night. And our EBITDA margins currently are running several hundred basis points ahead of last year same day. So as this business comes back, you're talking about filling rooms room
Revenue, that's extremely high margin, you're talking about high-end cash restaurant business coming back, you're talking about entertainment coming back, I think the recovery that's going to
Happen, the pace of it is going to be -- the magnitude of it is going to be far more dramatic than IC model and the pace, in my mind, is certainly going to be much, much quicker. 
And we're now, what, 7, 8 months post closing, the Caesars transaction. So we have done, obviously, quite a bit of integration post transaction. And I'd tell you that we have already well exceeded all of the synergy targets that we have out there and expect that to remain to be the case even after the world reopens and some of the costs come back. We think we'll be well in excess of both our pre-pandemic targets and the targets we added to during the pandemic. 
And then finally, in terms of my opening remarks, William Hill, I'm still limited in what I can -- we can say about that, given that the transaction has not closed yet, but we have 2 remaining kind of full regulatory meetings: one in Nevada, which is actually a 2 parter; and then one in Indiana. We anticipate both happening in March. Then we have a final court date in the U.K., which is set for March 30. Once we clear those, we will have cleared everything that we need to do to get closed. So you should expect us to be closing sometime post that court hearing. 
We are working through all of the integration of William Hill, particularly on the tech side. We
think we will be well positioned to have one of the best apps in the industry, integrated into Caesars
Rewards on both the sports side and the casino side by the beginning of the football season in 2021. And
With that, I'll flip to Anthony."

While 2020 was certainly a challenging year on many levels, I am extremely proud of our team members and their extraordinary dedication and commitment to running great properties. Our success this year could not have been accomplished without our team members' tireless efforts each day to provide a safe and healthy environment for our guests. 
Now turning to operations. In Las Vegas, we generated $90 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $100 million of property level EBITDA, excluding the Rio rent payments. EBITDA improved over 40% on a quarterly sequential basis. October was our strongest month, where we generated approximately $50 million of EBITDA. Total occupancy for Q4 was 60%, with weekend occupancy of
80% and mid-week occupancy of 50%. Casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was over 50% during Q4. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the booking trends for the second half of '21. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up over 30%, and we are seeing good rate growth as well. 2020 true group pace is up 10% in room nights, with strong rate growth versus this time last year. As we have mentioned before, future business on the books remains uncertain, but the strength of forward bookings tells us our customers are anxious to return to Las Vegas. 
On the FIT side, our booking pace continues to accelerate and it's at its highest level since reopening. Our booking windows are extending as well. 47% of Las Vegas market bookings since the beginning of the year or for at least 30 days out, almost double the percentage that we saw in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we are planning several property improvements in Las Vegas, including completely transforming the arrival experience at Caesars Palace, which has largely been untouched since the property opened in 1956. 
In addition, we will be adding several exciting new food and beverage concepts across our Vegas properties. In our regional markets, operating results were negatively impacted by property closures and incremental COVID-19 restrictions during the quarter. At our closed properties, we continue to pay team members' salaries and benefits throughout the quarter. In our regional nondestination properties and excluding property closures, revenues were down 17%, EBITDA was down 6% and EBITDAR margins improved approximately 400 basis points. 
10 regional properties within the portfolio reported quarterly EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin records. We have spent the last year refining our cost structure in both our destination and regional markets, and we expect meaningful EBITDA flow-through its recovery unfolds in '21. This should also lead to higher sustainable EBITDA margins. We are excited about the year ahead, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery of travel and tourism in the U.S. and especially here in Vegas. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the fourth quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?"

These proceeds further augment approximately $4 billion of year-end liquidity across our unrestricted cash on hand and available revolvers. 
We are well positioned to close on William Hill, which as Tom mentioned, we expect to happen early in the second quarter and our nearest debt maturities in December of 2024. capEx for 2021 is expected to land between $350 million and $400 million, excluding Atlantic City and Lake Charles, which we will be funding from escrow and insurance proceeds.

But there are no assets for sale in Las Vegas in our portfolio. We do still anticipate selling an asset in the future. But I want to be marketing that asset off of actual performance stewardship, not having to build a story, build a bridge to what it's doing today versus what we think it will be doing. 
So I would say based on what I'm seeing, you should expect a sale unlikely to take place in '21, probably looking at sometime in '22, most likely first half."

The answer to the first question is, yes, we are profitable in all verticals in that business. On the second piece, William Hill has been in a bit of suspended animation since we announced the transaction, where obviously, they were not integrated into Caesars when we announced it. There's not a lot that we're able to do in the period between signing and closing. So William Hill faced a situation where they had a brand that they knew was ultimately going to go away as the main driver of the business. 
So it made little sense to spent a lot of money to build a brand that's going to change early in 2021. We have not been in-charge of that the operating side of that business in the past. So we will -- we're in this to be a winner. And if the answer is we need to invest more money to build market share in whatever form that takes, you should expect that we would consider that. I consider us to be a pretty strong operating team. You shouldn't expect that to be any different when we're managing the sports and online business."

Obviously, I would have hoped it was -- construction was in earnest -- well in earnest at this point. So the timing has not been as quick as we'd hope, but the opportunity and the plan has not changed. 
In terms of Florida sports betting, Florida is an interesting place. Every year as the legislative session starts, your lobbyist tend to be super optimistic about what they're going to deliver. And then by the end of the session, they say, well, we just couldn't get anything done. It's a complex place to negotiate. You've got, obviously, the semis down there, the commercial casinos. You've got Disney, you've got Miami interests. 
So I think, like other places, the momentum publicly for wanting to be able to bet on sports is no different in Florida than elsewhere. Is that enough to break a log jam this year? I would probably bet no just because that's what Florida has shown me in the past, but I'm hopeful I'll be surprised."

It was, by any measure, the most challenging year that we've had operationally and personally to date. The fourth quarter was no exception to that. I want to start the call by recognizing all of our frontline employees. They lived through the vast majority of our employees being furloughed, then coming back into an environment where they were fearful for health and safety, fearful for what was happening at home with children or parents or grandparents or all of the above. And they came back and delivered the exceptional service that our customers are accustomed to at Caesars and operated through some extraordinary contact tracing changes in regulations, reopenings, closings throughout the year, and we couldn't be prouder of them.
For the fourth quarter, we did $346 million of EBITDA. We've listened and read others' calls, our cadence was similar. Almost half of our EBITDA happened in October, and then as regulation -- restrictions tightened across the country, November and December were sequentially less than October and we think the bottom for the business. And we'll talk about what we've seen in January and February and going forward that makes us highly confident of that.
In Las Vegas, we did $100 million of EBITDA, adding back the Rio rent payment, which we're proud of on a relative basis; but we know on an absolute basis, we've got a lot of wood to chop in Vegas as it reopens. We're seeing some encouraging signs there that I'll discuss. 
In the regional markets in the quarter, we had significant restrictions in Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio that related to operating hours. We had closures in Illinois, Pennsylvania that -- and the Lake Charles property from the prior hurricane. If you exclude just the closed properties, you include everything that had the operating restrictions. Our regional EBITDA margins were up about 400 basis points for the quarter. So still seeing through the noise strong evidence on the cost side that those -- that, that progress is continuing.
If you look at -- when I'm speaking to investors, I'm often asked what am I missing, what is the market missing. And what I think the market is missing now is similar to what I talked about in the last quarterly call. The demand that is coming as the world reopens and the flow-through that you should expect to see in this business post reopening is wildly underestimated by the markets.
I see kind of across the board in the sector a view in numbers estimates out there that suggest we get back to 2019 numbers kind of sometime in '23. I'm firmly convinced that we'll be at least run rating those numbers the first quarter that Vegas group business is back in earnest, and that could be as early as the second half of this year. So I think there's -- there needs -- there should be a dramatic pull forward of expectations of the turn.
And I'll give you a few examples of why I believe this to be the case. Currently, in Las Vegas, we are at our highest level of bookings since reopening. January and February have ramped up. It's almost like a switch was flipped sometime late January, early February. Our bookings are up 20% on a month-over-month basis in the FIT and casino segment. The -- we measure gross and net pickup. So gross pickup is how many aggregate rooms are booked in a day or a week or whatever period you're looking at. Net pickup is bookings less cancellations.
And if you look at our gross and net bookings, 9 of our top 10 days since the pandemic reopening in Las Vegas happened in February with Monday being the highest that we have seen to date. Importantly, the booking window is extending as well. So if you look back to -- from reopening until the end of '20, it seemed like you had a lot of impulse trips, very short booking windows. What we're seeing now is almost half of our bookings are for trips that are at least 30 days out, which is about double the pace that we had in the fourth quarter. So we're extremely encouraged by that.  
If you look at our actual performance, January and February, January was well in excess of November and December, approached October in terms of EBITDA. February has been strong as well, obviously, with fewer days in the month ultimately. But if we -- as we look forward at our forward booking forecast, by mid-March, we're well into the 50s in terms of percentage occupancy midweek on the Strip, and we're 95% plus on weekends.
If you look at our group business, for the second half of the year, we've got 32% more room nights on the books for the second half of '21 than we had for the second half of '19 on the same day. Now I'll grant you that we didn't have FORUM convention center in the fourth quarter of '19, but you're talking about almost $200 million of room night revenue on the books for the second half of the year for group business.
And remember, when we talk about group business, those are the rooms that are booked for the actual event. So as those groups come and your guests decide to come early, bring their wife, bring their families, stay a little longer, those rooms are not included in that group room night business. So we know that there's a lot of discussion and debate and prognostication about when the world will reopen. We're certainly heartened by all of the recent data, the vaccine advances in terms of coming supply. We're heartened by Governor Sisolak in Nevada providing a path that has us in position where we could be hosting group business by the middle of this year in earnest. And so we think there's light at the end of the tunnel there.
And when you look at what we're messaging to our internal operators is let's make sure that all of the cost discipline that we have found over the last year or so remains in place as business comes back. And we had kind of an anomaly in the fourth quarter in the Tahoe market, where California's regulations were far more stringent than Nevada. So you kind of got an early burst of demand that would sort of simulate what will happen in a reopening.
And our team up there, John Koster and his team did a fantastic job of maintaining discipline on the cost side so that Tahoe was up 7% in gaming revenue in the fourth quarter, was up almost 60% in EBITDA, with EBITDA margins growing by over 1,100 basis points. And it's that type of view that, admittedly, you don't get to see that gives me optimism.
If you look anecdotally at this past Saturday night in Las Vegas, nothing particularly interesting about it. It was -- we were 95% occupied. So you get to see what we look like virtually full. We were 99% last year at higher rates. There was nothing particularly notable about hold or high-end play on that night. And our EBITDA margins currently are running several hundred basis points ahead of last year same day.
So as this business comes back, you're talking about filling rooms -- room revenue that's extremely high margin. You're talking about high-end cash restaurant business coming back. You're talking about entertainment coming back. I think the recovery that's going to happen, the pace of it is going to be -- the magnitude of it is going to be far more dramatic than I see model and the pace, in my mind, is certainly going to be much, much quicker.
And we're now, what, 7, 8 months post-closing the Caesars transaction, so we have done, obviously, quite a bit of integration post transaction. And I'd tell you that we have already well exceeded all of the synergy targets that we have out there and expect that to remain to be the case even after the world reopens and some of the costs come back. We think we'll be well in excess of both our pre-pandemic targets and the targets we added to during the pandemic.
And then finally, in terms of my opening remarks, William Hill, I'm still limited in what I can -- we can say about that given that the transaction has not closed yet, but we have 2 remaining kind of full regulatory meetings: 1 in Nevada, which is actually a two-parter; and then 1 in Indiana. We anticipate both happening in March. Then we have a final court date in the U.K., which is set for March 30. Once we clear those, we will have cleared everything that we need to do to get closed. So you should expect us to be closing sometime post that court hearing.
We are working through all of the integration of William Hill, particularly on the tech side. We think we will be well positioned to have one of the best apps in the industry integrated into Caesars Rewards on both the sports side and the casino side by the beginning of the football season in 2021.
And with that, I'll flip to Anthony."

Our success this year could not have been accomplished without our team members' tireless efforts each day to provide a safe and healthy environment for our guests.
Now turning to operations. In Las Vegas, we generated $90 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $100 million of property level EBITDA, excluding the Rio rent payments. EBITDA improved over 40% on a quarterly sequential basis. October was our strongest month, where we generated approximately $50 million of EBITDA. Total occupancy for Q4 was 60% with weekend occupancy of 80% and mid-week occupancy of 50%. Casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was over 50% during Q4.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the booking trends for the second half of '21. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up over 30%, and we are seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group pace is up 10% in room nights with strong rate growth versus this time last year. As we have mentioned before, future business on the books remains uncertain, but the strength of forward bookings tells us our customers are anxious to return to Las Vegas.
On the FIT side, our booking pace continues to accelerate and it's at its highest level since reopening. Our booking windows are extending as well. 47% of Las Vegas market bookings since the beginning of the year are for at least 30 days out, almost double the percentage that we saw in the fourth quarter.
In 2021, we are planning several property improvements in Las Vegas, including completely transforming the arrival experience at Caesars Palace, which has largely been untouched since the property opened in 1966. In addition, we will be adding several exciting new food and beverage concepts across our Vegas properties.
In our regional markets, operating results were negatively impacted by property closures and incremental COVID-19 restrictions during the quarter. At our closed properties, we continue to pay team members' salaries and benefits throughout the quarter. In our regional nondestination properties and excluding property closures, revenues were down 17%, EBITDA was down 6% and EBITDAR margins improved approximately 400 basis points.
10 regional properties within the portfolio reported quarterly EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin records. We have spent the last year refining our cost structure in both our destination and regional markets, and we expect meaningful EBITDA flow-through as recovery unfolds in '21. This should also lead to higher sustainable EBITDA margins. We are excited about the year ahead, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery of travel and tourism in the U.S. and especially here in Vegas.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the fourth quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?"

Over $700 million of which is in the form of cash proceeds that we expect to receive during the second and third quarters of 2021. These proceeds further augment approximately $4 billion of year-end liquidity across our unrestricted cash on hand and available revolvers.
We are well positioned to close on William Hill, which as Tom mentioned, we expect to happen early in the second quarter and our nearest debt maturity is in December of 2024. CapEx for 2021 is expected to land between $350 million and $400 million, excluding Atlantic City and Lake Charles, which we will be funding from escrow and insurance proceeds.

The answer to the first question is, yes, we are profitable in all verticals in that business.
On the second piece, William Hill has been in a bit of suspended animation since we announced the transaction, where, obviously, they were not integrated into Caesars when we announced it. There's not a lot that we're able to do in the period between signing and closing. So William Hill faced a situation where they had a brand that they knew was ultimately going to go away as the main driver of the business, so it made little sense to spent a lot of money to build a brand that's going to change early in 2021.
We have not been in charge of that -- the operating side of that business in the past, so we will -- we're in this to be a winner. And if the answer is we need to invest more money to build market share in whatever form that takes, you should expect that we would consider that. I consider us to be a pretty strong operating team.

In terms of Florida sports betting, Florida is an interesting place. Every year, as the legislative session starts, your lobbyists tend to be super optimistic about what they're going to deliver. And then by the end of the session, they say, well, we just couldn't get anything done. It's a complex place to negotiate. You've got, obviously, the Seminoles down there, the commercial casinos. You've got Disney. You've got Miami interests.
So I think, like other places, the momentum publicly for wanting to be able to bet on sports is no different in Florida than elsewhere. Is that enough to break a log jam this year? I would probably bet no just because that's what Florida has shown me in the past, but I'm hopeful I'll be surprised."

It was, by any measure, the most challenging year that we've had operationally and personally to date. The fourth quarter was no exception to that. I want to start the call by recognizing all of our frontline employees. They lived through the vast majority of our employees being furloughed, then coming back into an environment where they were fearful for health and safety, fearful for what was happening at home with children or parents or grandparents or all of the above. And they came back and delivered the exceptional service that our customers are accustomed to at Caesars and operated through some extraordinary contact tracing changes in regulations, reopenings, closings throughout the year, and we couldn't be prouder of them.
For the fourth quarter, we did $346 million of EBITDA. We've listened and read others' calls, our cadence was similar. Almost half of our EBITDA happened in October, and then as regulation -- restrictions tightened across the country, November and December were sequentially less than October and we think the bottom for the business. And we'll talk about what we've seen in January and February and going forward that makes us highly confident of that.
In Las Vegas, we did $100 million of EBITDA, adding back the Rio rent payment, which we're proud of on a relative basis; but we know on an absolute basis, we've got a lot of wood to chop in Vegas as it reopens. We're seeing some encouraging signs there that I'll discuss. 
In the regional markets in the quarter, we had significant restrictions in Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio that related to operating hours. We had closures in Illinois, Pennsylvania that -- and the Lake Charles property from the prior hurricane. If you exclude just the closed properties, you include everything that had the operating restrictions. Our regional EBITDA margins were up about 400 basis points for the quarter. So still seeing through the noise strong evidence on the cost side that those -- that, that progress is continuing.
If you look at -- when I'm speaking to investors, I'm often asked what am I missing, what is the market missing. And what I think the market is missing now is similar to what I talked about in the last quarterly call. The demand that is coming as the world reopens and the flow-through that you should expect to see in this business post reopening is wildly underestimated by the markets.
I see kind of across the board in the sector a view in numbers estimates out there that suggest we get back to 2019 numbers kind of sometime in '23. I'm firmly convinced that we'll be at least run rating those numbers the first quarter that Vegas group business is back in earnest, and that could be as early as the second half of this year. So I think there's -- there needs -- there should be a dramatic pull forward of expectations of the turn.
And I'll give you a few examples of why I believe this to be the case. Currently, in Las Vegas, we are at our highest level of bookings since reopening. January and February have ramped up. It's almost like a switch was flipped sometime late January, early February. Our bookings are up 20% on a month-over-month basis in the FIT and casino segment. The -- we measure gross and net pickup. So gross pickup is how many aggregate rooms are booked in a day or a week or whatever period you're looking at. Net pickup is bookings less cancellations.
And if you look at our gross and net bookings, 9 of our top 10 days since the pandemic reopening in Las Vegas happened in February with Monday being the highest that we have seen to date. Importantly, the booking window is extending as well. So if you look back to -- from reopening until the end of '20, it seemed like you had a lot of impulse trips, very short booking windows. What we're seeing now is almost half of our bookings are for trips that are at least 30 days out, which is about double the pace that we had in the fourth quarter. So we're extremely encouraged by that. 
If you look at our actual performance, January and February, January was well in excess of November and December, approached October in terms of EBITDA. February has been strong as well, obviously, with fewer days in the month ultimately. But if we -- as we look forward at our forward booking forecast, by mid-March, we're well into the 50s in terms of percentage occupancy midweek on the Strip, and we're 95% plus on weekends.
If you look at our group business, for the second half of the year, we've got 32% more room nights on the books for the second half of '21 than we had for the second half of '19 on the same day. Now I'll grant you that we didn't have FORUM convention center in the fourth quarter of '19, but you're talking about almost $200 million of room night revenue on the books for the second half of the year for group business.
And remember, when we talk about group business, those are the rooms that are booked for the actual event. So as those groups come and your guests decide to come early, bring their wife, bring their families, stay a little longer, those rooms are not included in that group room night business. So we know that there's a lot of discussion and debate and prognostication about when the world will reopen. We're certainly heartened by all of the recent data, the vaccine advances in terms of coming supply. We're heartened by Governor Sisolak in Nevada providing a path that has us in position where we could be hosting group business by the middle of this year in earnest. And so we think there's light at the end of the tunnel there.
And when you look at what we're messaging to our internal operators is let's make sure that all of the cost discipline that we have found over the last year or so remains in place as business comes back. And we had kind of an anomaly in the fourth quarter in the Tahoe market, where California's regulations were far more stringent than Nevada. So you kind of got an early burst of demand that would sort of simulate what will happen in a reopening.
And our team up there, John Koster and his team did a fantastic job of maintaining discipline on the cost side so that Tahoe was up 7% in gaming revenue in the fourth quarter, was up almost 60% in EBITDA, with EBITDA margins growing by over 1,100 basis points. And it's that type of view that, admittedly, you don't get to see that gives me optimism.
If you look anecdotally at this past Saturday night in Las Vegas, nothing particularly interesting about it. It was -- we were 95% occupied. So you get to see what we look like virtually full. We were 99% last year at higher rates. There was nothing particularly notable about hold or high-end play on that night. And our EBITDA margins currently are running several hundred basis points ahead of last year same day.
So as this business comes back, you're talking about filling rooms -- room revenue that's extremely high margin. You're talking about high-end cash restaurant business coming back. You're talking about entertainment coming back. I think the recovery that's going to happen, the pace of it is going to be -- the magnitude of it is going to be far more dramatic than I see model and the pace, in my mind, is certainly going to be much, much quicker.
And we're now, what, 7, 8 months post-closing the Caesars transaction, so we have done, obviously, quite a bit of integration post transaction. And I'd tell you that we have already well exceeded all of the synergy targets that we have out there and expect that to remain to be the case even after the world reopens and some of the costs come back. We think we'll be well in excess of both our pre-pandemic targets and the targets we added to during the pandemic.
And then finally, in terms of my opening remarks, William Hill, I'm still limited in what I can -- we can say about that given that the transaction has not closed yet, but we have 2 remaining kind of full regulatory meetings: 1 in Nevada, which is actually a two-parter; and then 1 in Indiana. We anticipate both happening in March. Then we have a final court date in the U.K., which is set for March 30. Once we clear those, we will have cleared everything that we need to do to get closed. So you should expect us to be closing sometime post that court hearing.
We are working through all of the integration of William Hill, particularly on the tech side. We think we will be well positioned to have one of the best apps in the industry integrated into Caesars Rewards on both the sports side and the casino side by the beginning of the football season in 2021.
And with that, I'll flip to Anthony."

While 2020 was certainly a challenging year on many levels, I am extremely proud of our team members and their extraordinary dedication and commitment to running great properties. Our success this year could not have been accomplished without our team members' tireless efforts each day to provide a safe and healthy environment for our guests.
Now turning to operations. In Las Vegas, we generated $90 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $100 million of property level EBITDA, excluding the Rio rent payments. EBITDA improved over 40% on a quarterly sequential basis. October was our strongest month, where we generated approximately $50 million of EBITDA. Total occupancy for Q4 was 60% with weekend occupancy of 80% and mid-week occupancy of 50%. Casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was over 50% during Q4.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the booking trends for the second half of '21. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up over 30%, and we are seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group pace is up 10% in room nights with strong rate growth versus this time last year. As we have mentioned before, future business on the books remains uncertain, but the strength of forward bookings tells us our customers are anxious to return to Las Vegas.
On the FIT side, our booking pace continues to accelerate and it's at its highest level since reopening. Our booking windows are extending as well. 47% of Las Vegas market bookings since the beginning of the year are for at least 30 days out, almost double the percentage that we saw in the fourth quarter.
In 2021, we are planning several property improvements in Las Vegas, including completely transforming the arrival experience at Caesars Palace, which has largely been untouched since the property opened in 1966. In addition, we will be adding several exciting new food and beverage concepts across our Vegas properties.
In our regional markets, operating results were negatively impacted by property closures and incremental COVID-19 restrictions during the quarter. At our closed properties, we continue to pay team members' salaries and benefits throughout the quarter. In our regional nondestination properties and excluding property closures, revenues were down 17%, EBITDA was down 6% and EBITDAR margins improved approximately 400 basis points.
10 regional properties within the portfolio reported quarterly EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin records. We have spent the last year refining our cost structure in both our destination and regional markets, and we expect meaningful EBITDA flow-through as recovery unfolds in '21. This should also lead to higher sustainable EBITDA margins. We are excited about the year ahead, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery of travel and tourism in the U.S. and especially here in Vegas.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the fourth quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret?"

These proceeds further augment approximately $4 billion of year-end liquidity across our unrestricted cash on hand and available revolvers.
We are well positioned to close on William Hill, which as Tom mentioned, we expect to happen early in the second quarter and our nearest debt maturity is in December of 2024. CapEx for 2021 is expected to land between $350 million and $400 million, excluding Atlantic City and Lake Charles, which we will be funding from escrow and insurance proceeds.

On the second piece, William Hill has been in a bit of suspended animation since we announced the transaction, where, obviously, they were not integrated into Caesars when we announced it. There's not a lot that we're able to do in the period between signing and closing. So William Hill faced a situation where they had a brand that they knew was ultimately going to go away as the main driver of the business, so it made little sense to spent a lot of money to build a brand that's going to change early in 2021.
We have not been in charge of that -- the operating side of that business in the past, so we will -- we're in this to be a winner.

Obviously, I would have hoped it was -- construction was in earnest -- well in earnest at this point. So the timing has not been as quick as we'd hope, but the opportunity and the plan has not changed.
In terms of Florida sports betting, Florida is an interesting place. Every year, as the legislative session starts, your lobbyists tend to be super optimistic about what they're going to deliver. And then by the end of the session, they say, well, we just couldn't get anything done. It's a complex place to negotiate. You've got, obviously, the Seminoles down there, the commercial casinos. You've got Disney. You've got Miami interests.
So I think, like other places, the momentum publicly for wanting to be able to bet on sports is no different in Florida than elsewhere. Is that enough to break a log jam this year? I would probably bet no just because that's what Florida has shown me in the past, but I'm hopeful I'll be surprised."

We are very pleased with our quarter. 13 of our properties EBITDA records in Q1, 19 had EBITDA margin records in Q1 and 20 properties had all-time EBITDA records in March, including 4 of our biggest properties. 
Turning to Las Vegas. We generated $161 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $172 million of property-level EBITDA, excluding Rio rent payments. EBITDA improved [indiscernible] on a quarterly sequential basis. March was our strongest month where we generated approximately $90 million of EBITDA ex Rio rent payments and an all-time EBITDAR margin record of 43%. 
Total occupancy for Q1 was 63% with weekends at 85% and midweek at 32%. March total occupancy was 77% and April was 84%. Weekends in Las Vegas are sold out for the foreseeable future. Finally, casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was approximately 40% during the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of the year. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19, are currently pacing up approximately 20%, and we're seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group revenue on the books is pacing up approximately 15%. Caesars FORUM for all future periods has booked over 165 events, 1.6 million room nights and $633 million of revenues. 80% of this business is new to Caesars. We are very optimistic regarding the remaining 3 quarters of the year in Las Vegas and the return of the group and convention business and entertainment offerings that will drive incremental demand to the market. 
Now turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q4 of '20 trends. On a year-over-year basis, regional revenues were flat and adjusted EBITDA was up 69%. Looking back to Q1 of 2019, revenues declined 14% and EBIT was 4%, resulting in EBITDAR margin gains of approximately 600 basis points. In March of '21, revenues for the consolidated regional portfolio declined 10% versus 2019, and adjusted EBITDA was up 5%. In our regional non destination properties in Q1 '21 versus Q1 of '19 and excluding Lake Charles which is closed, revenues were down 8%, adjusted EBITDA was up 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 800 basis points. 
And finally, in our regional destination properties are starting to see encouraging trends for this segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this group of properties on a quarterly sequential basis improved 110% and margins improved 980 basis points. We expect to see continued improvement for these properties throughout the remaining 3 quarters of the year. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams and their execution during the first quarter. The execution, coupled with our operating philosophy will continue to lead to sustainable improvements in adjusted EBITDA margin going forward. We are excited about the remainder of the year and look forward to sharing our progress with you on future quarterly earnings calls. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

And as I get into speaking about it, I want to recognize Joe Asher, who built the William Hill business, and we got to know each other well in the original partnership. But as most of you know, Joe, you know me, I've done quite a few deals in the time we've been a public company, put together that original partnership and never met until the licensing hearing where it was approved. Joe built a phenomenal business from really very little in the U.S., and we're excited to build on the foundation that he and his team have built as we move forward. 
As you look at what that combined business did in the quarter, we were about $150 million of revenue. We were positive EBITDA that was despite the limitations of the transaction, where with the U.K. rules, we were kind of frozen in place. William Hill had some effectively brands in a number of markets that it didn't make a lot of sense to invest a lot of money in. William Hill with the U.K. parent and U.K. investor mindset that, that was more conservative toward leverage was not as aggressive as we expect we will be in this business. And so what we needed to move forward really was to take control of our destiny by buying William Hill and to come up with the capital to invest appropriately in the business. And as I get further in terms of results, we'll get to the capital piece. But while we were working through the process, William Hill was working on rolling the Liberty platform out in all the jurisdictions where it is not already employed, we expect that to happen for football season. We're going to run our books as Caesars, our app sports and tie our business into our Caesars Rewards database. 
And as I look at what's out there in sports and do the analysis of the numbers that we can see, there's some things that make us optimistic. There's a great of correlation between spend and market share at this point, not quite so much for brand or other non spend categories. That's a good thing for us when I talk about the cash flow that we're generating right now. If you look at what our friends at Michigan, in the quarter came from a position similar to where William Hill was to a leadership position in a market where they had a large database, that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward. But we understand that we're going to need to invest in this business, both on the tech and the customer acquisition side, and you should expect a significant shift from us as we close the transaction and move forward. 
The -- and where I want to get -- where I want to move to now is in terms of the quarter, we reported a quarter like we report any other, 3 months, total Anthony went through the numbers, but it really doesn't tell the story this quarter. I spoke on the last couple of calls about the demand that we expected was coming and the flow-through that we would expect to see, and I'm pleased to report I can give you some evidence of what's happening in March and April. I'm not going to get in the habit of disclosing a lot about the current month. But what's happening business is so different than the narrative that I see out there, that I think in this quarter, it makes sense to give you a lot of metrics about what's going on. 
As we started in the quarter, we had Illinois and Pennsylvania were closed. We had significant restrictions across any number of states, including Nevada. We didn't open Nevada even to 50% until 2 weeks were left in the quarter. So we saw demand build throughout the quarter as reopening happen. And March EBITDA was almost half of the first quarter number. So that brought us into April. And the fear that's been expressed to me is there's going to be some sort of in demand as the world reopens. People that were coming to casinos, when other options open up, going to go away. And what we said is we think that the segments that are not coming or at the time, we're going to come back and swamp whatever business that we were losing. And that's indeed been the case. 
If you look at April, obviously, these are preliminary results on May 4. Frankly, they tend to typically move up after our preliminary results. But in April, we did over $300 million of consolidated EBITDA as a company. That was more than 25% ahead of '20 numbers. Consolidated margin was over 37%. That was 1,000 basis points ahead of 2019. In those numbers, Vegas' percentage was 9%, which for those of you who follow the industry for a while is extremely low. Despite that low Vegas has set another record in EBITDA margin for the market at 43.5%. If you adjust for in the quarter, Vegas EBITDA margin was almost 47%. 
Our regional run rate EBITDA is now over $2.5 billion, just out of regionals. The destination markets Anthony touched on it a bit, have been coming back. As an example, Reno had the third best month it's ever had in April. And I should say, when I talk about April, Easter fell in April, it's typically not a great month for the casino business. So these numbers happen during that time. As Anthony touched on occupancy was 84% in April, we expect that to increase in May and June. 
And if you look on a property basis in April, we had 36 properties in our portfolio that were over 40% EBITDA margin. 14 of those were over 50% EBITDA margin and one was over 60. And as a result, in April and our current run rate, we're generating over $100 million of free cash flow per month right now. And with that, I'll flip to Bret on our liquidity and capital."

I think that this is -- if you think about investment history, you really had go back to kind of wartime tariffs where the country mobilized for -- in the case of World War I and World War II, to win wars. So they pointed all of the economic capacity and the bulk of the economic capacity of the country had military outcomes. In this case, we've spent the last year pointing this at this virus and have made progress on the vaccine front that I never would have imagined was possible. And then we pointed a of money at consumers. So these consumers were at home largely for the better part of the year not commuting, not spending all the money that you spend, going to and from work, eating at work, going out, the savings rate is astronomical relative to historic norms. As the world reopens, already see this capital being unlocked and coming into our doors. We're still early there. So I just don't expect this to change quickly. So I don't spend a lot of time worrying that what happens when you can go to a movie theater or get on a cruise ship. I think the demand for entertainment and just fun after the last 12 to 14 months is going to be like nothing any of us have seen in our lifetimes."

We are very pleased with our quarter. 13 of our properties had EBITDA records in Q1, 19 had EBITDA margin records in Q1 and 20 properties had all-time EBITDA records in March, including 4 of our biggest properties.  
Turning to Las Vegas. We generated $161 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $172 million of property-level EBITDA, excluding Rio rent payments. EBITDA improved [indiscernible] on a quarterly sequential basis. March was our strongest month where we generated approximately $90 million of EBITDA ex Rio rent payments and an all-time EBITDAR margin record of 43%.  
Total occupancy for Q1 was 63% with weekends at 85% and midweek at 52%. March total occupancy was 77% and April was 84%. Weekends in Las Vegas are sold out for the foreseeable future. Finally, casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was approximately 40% during the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of the year. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19, are currently pacing up approximately 20%, and we're seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group revenue on the books is pacing up approximately 15%. CAESARS FORUM for all future periods has booked over 165 events, 1.6 million room nights and $633 million of revenues, 80% of this business is new to Caesars. We are very optimistic regarding the remaining 3 quarters of the year in Las Vegas and the return of the group and convention business and entertainment offerings that will drive incremental demand to the market.  
Now turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q4 of '20 trends. On a year-over-year basis, regional revenues were flat and adjusted EBITDA was up 69%. Looking back to Q1 of 2019, revenues declined 14% and EBIT was 4%, resulting in EBITDAR margin gains of approximately 600 basis points. 
In March of '21, revenues for the consolidated regional portfolio declined 10% versus 2019, and adjusted EBITDA was up 5%. In our regional non destination properties in Q1 '21 versus Q1 of '19 and excluding Lake Charles, which is closed, revenues were down 8%, adjusted EBITDA was up 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 800 basis points.  
And finally, in our regional destination properties we are starting to see encouraging trends for this segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this group of properties on a quarterly sequential basis improved 110% and margins improved 980 basis points. We expect to see continued improvement for these properties throughout the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
I'm extremely proud of our operating teams and their execution during the first quarter. The execution, coupled with our operating philosophy will continue to lead to sustainable improvements in adjusted EBITDA margin going forward. We are excited about the remainder of the year and look forward to sharing our progress with you on future quarterly earnings calls. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
3133890,710024265,2269245,"Caesars Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Caesars Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Anthony. Also, since we last spoke to you, we closed the William Hill transaction, it took a little longer than we had expected in the court hearing but we got to the outcome that we wanted. And now we control our own destiny in what I continue to",1092,"Thanks, Anthony. Also, since we last spoke to you, we closed the William Hill transaction, it took a little longer than we had expected in the court hearing but we got to the outcome that we wanted. And now we control our own destiny in what I continue to believe is an extraordinarily exciting opportunity for the company. And as I get into speaking about it, I want to recognize Joe Asher, who built the William Hill business, and we got to know each other well in the original partnership.
But as most of you know, Joe, you know me, I've done quite a few deals in the time we've been a public company, put together that original partnership and never met until the licensing hearing where it was approved. Joe built a phenomenal business from really very little in the U.S., and we're excited to build on the foundation that he and his team have built as we move forward.  
As you look at what that combined business did in the quarter, we were about $150 million of revenue. We were positive EBITDA that was despite the limitations of the transaction, where with the U.K. rules, we were kind of frozen in place. William Hill had some effectively lame duck brands in a number of markets that it didn't make a lot of sense to invest a lot of money in. William Hill with the U.K. parent and U.K. investor mindset that, that was more conservative toward leverage was not as aggressive as we expect we will be in this business. And so what we needed to move forward really was to take control of our destiny by buying William Hill and to come up with the capital to invest appropriately in the business.
And as I get further into results, we'll get to the capital piece. But while we were working through the process, William Hill was working on rolling the Liberty platform out in all the jurisdictions where it is not already employed, we expect that to happen for football season. We're going to rebrand our books as Caesars, our app as Caesars Sports and tie our business into our Caesars Rewards database.  
And as I look at what's out there in sports and do the analysis of the numbers that we can see, there's some things that make us optimistic. There's a great correlation between spend and market share at this point, not quite so much for brand or other non spend categories. That's a good sign for us when I talk about the cash flow that we're generating right now. If you look at what our friends at MGM Michigan, in the quarter where they came from a position similar to where William Hill was to a leadership position in a market where they had a large database, that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward. But we understand that we're going to need to invest in this business, both on the tech and the customer acquisition side, and you should expect a significant shift from us as we close the transaction and move forward.  
The -- and where I want to get -- where I want to move to now is in terms of the quarter, we reported a quarter like we report any other, you report your 3 months, your total, Anthony went through the numbers, but it really doesn't tell the story this quarter. I spoke on the last couple of calls about the demand that we expected was coming and the flow-through that we would expect to see, and I'm pleased to report I can give you some evidence of what's happening in March and April. 
I'm not going to get in the habit of disclosing a lot about the current month. But what's happening in our business is so different than the narrative that I see out there, that I think in this quarter, it makes sense to give you a lot of metrics about what's going on.  
As we started in the quarter, we had Illinois and Pennsylvania were closed. We had significant restrictions across any number of states, including Nevada. We didn't open Nevada even to 50% until 2 weeks were left in the quarter. So we saw demand build throughout the quarter as reopening happen. And March EBITDA was almost half of the first quarter number. So that brought us into April. 
And the fear that's been expressed to me is there's going to be some sort of diminution in demand as the world reopens. People that were coming to casinos, when other options open up, were going to go away. And what we said is we think that the segments that are not coming or at the time were going to come back and swamp whatever business that we were losing. And that's indeed been the case.  
If you look at April, obviously, these are preliminary results on May 4. Frankly, they tend to typically move up after our preliminary results. But in April, we did over $300 million of consolidated EBITDA as a company. That was more than 25% ahead of 2019 numbers. Consolidated margin was over 37%. That was 1,000 basis points ahead of 2019. 
In those numbers, Vegas' table hold percentage was 9%, which for those of you who follow the industry for a while is extremely low. Despite that low table hold Vegas has set another record in EBITDA margin for the market at 43.5%. If you adjust for hold in the quarter, Vegas EBITDA margin was almost 47%.  
Our regional run rate EBITDA is now over $2.5 billion, just out of regionals. The destination markets Anthony touched on it a bit, have been coming back. As an example, Reno had the third best month it's ever had in April. And I should say, when I talk about April, Easter fell in April, it's typically not a great month for the casino business. So these numbers happen during that time. As Anthony touched on Vegas occupancy was 84% in April, we expect that to increase in May and June.  
And if you look on a property basis in April, we had 36 properties in our portfolio that were over 40% EBITDA margin. 14 of those were over 50% EBITDA margin and one was over 60. And as a result, in April in our current run rate, we're generating over $100 million of free cash flow per month right now. And with that, I'll flip to Bret on our liquidity and capital."

This initial $2 billion of debt repayment assumes a conservative sale price for William Hill's non-U.S. assets with the transaction closing within 12 months. Importantly, this will in no way hamper our ability to continue investing in our brick-and-mortar portfolio and our sports and online business.  
With William Hill U.S. now officially folded in, our 2021 calendar year CapEx moves to $400 million to $450 million, excluding spend in Atlantic City and Lake Charles, which are covered by escrow and insurance proceeds. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

So yes, I would say on a consolidated basis, you should at the very least expect that each of Vegas, regional and consolidated ends up in excess of 40%, and that's kind of a function of -- we came in seeing that business could be done differently here in terms of what you've seen before and margins could be higher than you've historically seen in this market. 
And the confluence of factors that we've seen since we got here, in particular, the way the team has come together and embraced what we've brought and really built upon it. The expectations for margin are above what we were anticipating when we got here. Yes. I mean -- so $10 a share of free cash flow with no debt pay down suggests we need to do, what, 4 2 of EBITDA, I would say, we should be able to do considerably more than that."

I think that this is -- if you think about investment history, you really have go back to kind of wartime tariffs where the country mobilized for -- in the case of World War I and World War II, to win wars. So they pointed all of the economic capacity -- the bulk of the economic capacity of the country at military outcomes. 
In this case, we've spent the last year pointing this at this virus and have made progress on the vaccine front that I never would have imagined was possible. And then we pointed a firehose of money at consumers. So these consumers were at home largely for the better part of the year not commuting, not spending all the money that you spend, going to and from work, eating at work, going out, the savings rate is astronomical relative to historic norms. 
As the world reopens, already see this capital being unlocked and coming into our doors. We're still early there. So I just don't expect this to change quickly. So I don't spend a lot of time worrying that what happens when you can go to a movie theater or get on a cruise ship.

We feel good about what's coming. You've got Vegas, second half of the year is jammed. If you look at forward dates in the market, there's extremely robust demand because you basically sat out 1.5 years by the time business gets here. So we think the group story is going to be a very good story when the door is open, starting in June."

Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-week occupancy, 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up approximately 15%. 
CAESERS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is brand new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Seizures Digital segment, we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical casinos while earning loyalty rewards. 
On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022. 
We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter, and throughout that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter, I was actually thinking it would be this quarter",1060,"Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter, and throughout that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter, I was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mass mandates coming back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over 2 months of social distancing restricted occupancy and masks, restricting occupancy and restaurants and on the casino floor, plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane, the drags that I look at in the quarter were about $40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally.
We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials now you can see Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business. 
And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to have of managed international and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over $100 million of annual EBITDA and that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property. 
If you look at the bricks and mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas, if you look at it on a consolidated basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-and-mortar business. 
On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars sports book. We closed the William Hill transaction a little over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. -- because of the rules in the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics. You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million people tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts. We're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR code, and we'll be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in. And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I look at any business opportunity within the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that we've got to jump in and compete. So you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to at maturity be generating at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every day of the week. The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important that we're able to separate this and show you what is the brick-and-mortar business look like versus what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up. We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity. I'm really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity."

So whether I have 300 hotel rooms open in a regional property versus 175 really doesn't make a huge difference in materiality to my EBITDA. In Las Vegas, that's an entirely different animal.

And look, my view is this is a unique situation in that you've got a bit of the Wild West where things opened up quickly and everybody is looking for where the customers are. If you look at the companies that have very large databases coming into this or even look at the ones that have been successful converting smaller databases, it's because they know where the customers are. We've got over the 60 million people in our database, we have the wherewithal to serve the highest level customer down to the lowest level customer. We have a well-developed rewards program in place that treats customers to increasing levels of service as their value to us increases. That's all -- that mousetrap has already been built. It's never really been used in the sports business anywhere, a, because you have companies that are off to quick starts here that just don't have that kind of database and that kind of system. And you've got others like us that are kind of just getting our ducks in a row. But I look at it like we can create -- if we lean into this appropriately, we've got 54,000 salespeople in our company that work it with customers every day can open accounts. We have dedicated player development executives that deal with building relationships and expanding those relationships every day and have for decades. We have physical experiences that we can offer and tie into that business that I think position us well ultimately for success.

Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-week occupancy 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up approximately 15%.
CAESARS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is brand new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Caesars Digital segment, we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical casinos while earning loyalty rewards.
On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022. 
We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter.",1060,"Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mask mandates coming back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over 2 months of social distancing, restricted occupancy and masks, restricting occupancy in restaurants and on the casino floor plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane. The drags that I look at in the quarter were about $40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally.
We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials. Now you can see Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business.
And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to have of Managed and International and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over $100 million of annual EBITDA and that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property. 
If you look at the bricks-and-mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas. If you look at it on a consolidated basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-and-mortar business.
On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars Sportsbook. We closed the William Hill transaction a little over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. Because of the rules in the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics. You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million people tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts. 
We're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR code, and will be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in. 
And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I look at any business opportunity within the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that we've got to jump in and compete. So you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next 2.5 years to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to, at maturity, be generating at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every day of the week. 
The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important that we're able to separate this and show you what does the brick-and-mortar business look like versus what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up. We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity, I'm really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday.
And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity."

So I think there's absolutely a significant addition as that group business comes back, it is heartening to see what we can do without that business, though, because in the second quarter, we had very little group business to speak of.

If you look at the companies that have very large databases coming into this or even look at the ones that have been successfully converting smaller databases, it's because they know where the customers are. 
We've got over the 60 million people in our database. We have the wherewithal to serve the highest-level customer down to the lowest-level customer. We have a well-developed rewards program in place that treats customers to increasing levels of service as their value to us increases. That's all -- that mousetrap has already been built. It's never really been used in the sports business anywhere, a, because you have companies that are off to quick starts here that just don't have that kind of database and that kind of system. And you've got others like us that are kind of just getting our ducks in a row. 
But I look at it like we can create -- if we lean into this appropriately, we've got 54,000 salespeople in our company that work it with customers every day can open accounts. We have dedicated player development executives that deal with building relationships and expanding those relationships every day and have for decades. We have physical experiences that we can offer and tie into that business that I think position us well ultimately for success.

Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-week occupancy 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up approximately 15%.
CAESARS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is brand new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Caesars Digital segment, we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical casinos while earning loyalty rewards.
On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022. 
We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter.",1060,"Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mask mandates coming back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over 2 months of social distancing, restricted occupancy and masks, restricted occupancy in restaurants and on the casino floor plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane. The drags that I look at in the quarter were about $40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally.
We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials. Now you can see Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business.
And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to have of Managed and International and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over $100 million of annual EBITDA. And that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property. 
If you look at the bricks-and-mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas. If you look at it on a consolidated basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-and-mortar business.
On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars Sportsbook. We closed the William Hill transaction a little over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. Because of the rules in the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics. You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million people, tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts. 
We're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR code, and will be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in. 
And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I'd look at any business opportunity within the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that we've got to jump in and compete. So you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next 2.5 years to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to, at maturity, be generating at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every day of the week. 
The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important that we're able to separate this and show you what does the brick-and-mortar business look like versus what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up. We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity, I'm really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday.
And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity."

If you look at the companies that have very large databases coming into this or even look at the ones that have been successful converting smaller databases, it's because they know where the customers are. 
We've got over the 60 million people in our database. We have the wherewithal to serve the highest-level customer down to the lowest-level customer. We have a well-developed rewards program in place that treats customers to increasing levels of service as their value to us increases. That's all -- that mousetrap has already been built.

Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-week occupancy 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up approximately 15%.
CAESARS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is brand new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Caesars Digital segment, we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical casinos while earning loyalty rewards.
On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022. 
We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter.",1060,"Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mask mandates coming back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over 2 months of social distancing, restricted occupancy and masks, restricted occupancy in restaurants and on the casino floor plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane. The drags that I look at in the quarter were about $40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally.
We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials. Now you can see Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business.
And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to have of Managed and International and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over $100 million of annual EBITDA. And that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property. 
If you look at the bricks-and-mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas. If you look at it on a consolidated basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-and-mortar business.
On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars Sportsbook. We closed the William Hill transaction a little over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. Because of the rules in the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics. You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million people, tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts. 
We're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR code, and will be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in. 
And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I'd look at any business opportunity within the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that we've got to jump in and compete. So you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next 2.5 years to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to, at maturity, be generating at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every day of the week. 
The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important that we're able to separate this and show you what does the brick-and-mortar business look like versus what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up. We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity, I'm really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday.
And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity."

Our record-setting operating performance in the second quarter generated over $500 million of free cash flow, which, in turn, we applied to retire our remaining convertible debt and make a onetime payment to acquire the license rights for Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas in perpetuity. This combination of debt repayment and license fee buyout results in over $40 million of annualized free cash flow and set the table for further free cash flow benefits from deleveraging and refinancing activity.
With investment plans for Caesars Digital now formalized, our 2021 calendar year CapEx moves to $500 million to $550 million, which includes approximately $100 million for Caesars Digital and acceleration of spend in New Orleans. Net of growth CapEx, our annual core CapEx remains approximately $400 million. We commenced the sale process for William Hill's non-U.S. assets in the second quarter and expect to announce the transaction no later than early Q4 of this year.

The third quarter of '21 was another strong quarter. We delivered $1.04 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, which represented a quarterly record for our brick-",820,"Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. The third quarter of '21 was another strong quarter. We delivered $1.04 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, which represented a quarterly record for our brick-and-mortar properties. 31 of our 51 properties set a record for the highest third quarter EBITDA, while 32 set a record for the highest Q3 EBITDA margin. 
Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends remained exceptionally strong through the quarter, leading to an all-time quarterly record of $500 million in adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment. Excluding real rent payments, EBITDA improved 44% versus the third quarter of 2019 and margins improved 1,400 basis points to 50%. Total occupancy for Q3 was 89%, with weekend occupancy at 97% and midweek occupancy 86%. 
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends into 2022 and beyond. While attrition remains higher than normal, we began to see conventions return to Las Vegas in the third quarter, and the segment represented approximately 10% of occupied room nights, a dramatic improvement versus the of '21. We continue to expect to see a gradual recovery in the segment leading into next year, and we are encouraged as group and convention revenues on the books for '22 continue to pace nicely ahead of '19. Demand for the CAESARS FORUM is exceeding the original underwriting expectations, with over 175 events booked currently representing 1.8 million room nights and over $650 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results remained strong, especially in markets not impacted by severe natural disaster events. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding New Orleans, Lake Tahoe and Lake Charles increased 35% versus 2019, with margins improving by 860 bps to 38%. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest third quarter EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 
In our Caesars Digital segment, we generated over $3 billion of volume, $96 million of net revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $164 million. Sports betting and iCasino handle was split roughly 55-45. 90% of our handle was from mobile sports betting and iCasino. We are laser focused on scaling our digital business through aggressive customer acquisition during our first fall sports season, post launch of our Caesars branded apps in 9 states. While customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, net revenues were negatively impacted by directed promotional investment in odds and profit boost, competitive pricing strategies and lower than historical hold in certain markets. We are pleased that our sports betting handle share in the 8 states operating on Liberty platform has increased to 12% through September. Arizona has not reported, and therefore, not included in these stats. 
Our national market share through September, including all legalized sports betting states sits at 17%. Following the exciting launch of retail sports betting in Louisiana on Sunday, we now offer sports betting in 20 jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile. Importantly, we expect to complete the migration of our legacy apps in Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania and Illinois to our Liberty platform in 2022. 
We are also excited bowing out enhanced iCasino offerings in the fourth quarter following anticipated regulatory approvals related to the release of new games in New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia. Our expanded game portfolio will be accompanied by significant improvements to our in-app marketing technologies. 
On the development front, we are making great progress on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the fourth quarter of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace is making great progress, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience sometime in Q1 of '22. 
In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion in Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of '22. And finally, in Atlantic City, our $400 million capital plan is actively moving forward with remodeling room towers and setting the stage for exciting new food and beverage and entertainment options. 
As we look to 2022 to see several tailwinds in our business, and we remain optimistic about further visitation gains as consumers return to our property once COVID fears have fully subsided. We remain confident in the eventual return of the convention customer to Las Vegas and our destination markets. 
Lastly, we are excited to rebrand a handful of our properties in 2022 using flagship brands from the Caesars portfolio to even further elevate the customer experience. 
I am extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during this third quarter. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter."
3133890,1683578377,2421964,"Caesars Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Caesars Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everybody. We pre-released for our bond deal in earlier in the quarter. So you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations effectively. So I'm going to be lighter on Tom [indiscernible] brick-and-mortar go a little dee",1499,"Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everybody. We pre-released for our bond deal in earlier in the quarter. So you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations effectively. So I'm going to be lighter on Tom [indiscernible] brick-and-mortar go a little deeper into digital. 
On the brick-and-mortar side, if -- didn't hit New Orleans and we didn't have the Caldor fire in Tahoe, we would have done $1.1 billion of brick-and-mortar EBITDA in the quarter. We had an extremely strong quarter. Demand remains particularly robust. 
In regards to New Orleans and Tahoe, Tahoe has pretty quickly recovered back to above 2019 levels, not quite as strong as it was pre-fire, but continuing to build. In New Orleans, recall that we have significant operating leverage there that works in both directions. You've got a minimum guaranteed tax payment to the state and the city in Louisiana. So New Orleans EBITDA continues to trail '19 although it is continuing to recover as well. 
Going into the storm, we were doing $11 million, $12 million a month in EBITDA out of New Orleans, and now we're more like $5 million or $6 million in building. Vegas had a record quarter, beating the record of the second quarter. So $424 million went to $500 million EBITDA $511 million adding back the real rent payment. As Anthony said, we were 50% margin again. That was in spite of us imposing occupancy caps midweek, so that we could calibrate the supply with our housekeeping services. 
We are struggling across the country to hire guest room attendance. Vegas is no exception. So even with the operating caps, we set a quarterly EBITDA record. In October, Vegas had the strongest EBITDA month in the history of Caesars. So the strength has continued into October, regionals as well. We're still pacing up in the neighborhood of 40% over '19. So I feel very good about the setup going into '22. Customer demand remains strong. Obviously, the virus numbers have subsided considerably over the past 6 to 8 weeks, and we're seeing some pickup in demand as that rolls through. 
For Digital, I spoke to Digital in the second quarter call in terms of what you should expect from us. As I said, we anticipated investing in the terms of cumulative EBITDA losses north of $1 billion into the Digital segment and generating cash-on-cash EBITDA returns at maturity north of 50%. And what we saw in terms of opportunity for us was the ability to activate our 50-plus properties, our 50,000-plus employees and most importantly, our 65 million strong Caesars Rewards database, and that's what we set out to do. 
So as I go through these numbers, I'm going to talk about how I look at this business in terms of measuring what we're doing versus expectations. I would -- even though we're extremely encouraged that the numbers that I'm going to be talking about are ahead of our internal expectations as we launch this. It's very early, and this is a long game. So we expect it to not be a straight line. But what we anticipated was in states where we offered our Liberty technology where we were starting on equal footing and where we had existing strong database that those would be our most effective markets. And that describes Arizona to a tea, which launched during the quarter, has not published results yet, but we think that the results will show us in excess of the handle number -- percentage numbers that Anthony described earlier. 
In the Liberty states in total and I'm looking at handle because in the current customer acquisition environment, hold is volatile, not just because of the results of the sporting events, but because of the boost and the promotions that you offer. So when I talk about share, I'm talking about handle share. So in our Liberty states, handle share has almost doubled since launch. That's in the 6s to about 12% mobile market share. That's without Arizona. As I said, I'd expect that to exceed the average and bring it higher. 
Arizona is our second -- our third strongest state behind Nevada and Iowa, where we have incumbent advantages and that reflects exactly what we expected. States where we launched, but we were late to the game, but did have Liberty, we're seeing continued build in market share on the order of 200 to 500 basis points, depending on the market since we launched. 
Importantly, if you're looking at analysis that looks at market share across the entire U.S. market realize that we are not competing for the time being in Pennsylvania and Illinois, which are 2 of the biggest markets out there. When we launched, the Liberty platform was not approved in either state. It will be approved in the first half of 2022 is our expectation. But we didn't want to spend money guiding customers to an experience that would not be what we wanted to offer them. And so you see our share in those markets sucks for lack of a better term. If you look at where our customers are coming from, when you're spending like we're spending on advertising and promotion, you're going to get lots and lots of customers that show up at your door. A lot of them are not going to be worth a lot of value. If you look at our customer by count, Caesars Rewards customers are somewhere around 1/3 of our total new deposits since we relaunched. By handle, Caesars Rewards customers are about half of our handle since relaunch. So validating that we think Caesars built a system over 2 decades that identified the valuable customers that everyone is out there searching for, we're seeing that in our experience, and that's extremely encouraging as we look to the future. 
The performance in Arizona, also encouraging as we look to states like Louisiana, which just launched retail. Sunday, we'll launch mobile in the near future. Maryland will come online soon as well. These are states where we're in a similar position to where we were in Arizona, so we'd expect to perform well. 
When we show -- when we give you our 70% total market share, that's everything. That's the states we're not doing well in like Pennsylvania and Illinois that are not Liberty states, but also includes Nevada, which is not a Liberty state where we have tremendous market share. We're not adding fantasy numbers in there. We're not adding a horse racing business in there. We're showing you pure sports betting handle. And if you think about what we did in sports in the quarter, our handle for the third quarter was a little under 1 point -- I'm sorry, a little over $1.7 billion for the full quarter. In October alone, we did over $1.3 billion handle. So we think we're continuing to generate momentum. 
And when I talked about the return on investment, obviously, we had a model that showed where we expected to get in market share and the pace at which we expected to get there. So you can see from the EBITDA loss that it's relatively in line with what we were telling people to expect but our ramp in market share has exceeded our expectations in terms of its pace. 
Now the question to that is, does that mean there's a broader market -- bigger market share number down the road? And the candid answer is we don't know right now. But what we do know is we're gaining share at a pace stronger than we expected given the investment that we've made. So encouraging results from sports. 
In iCasino, if you want to think about somewhere where we have tracked a little bit below plan, we inherited a platform in iCasino that was noncompetitive from a game offering standpoint. And so again, we've not spent money advertising and promoting our iCasino business until we get the approvals we need to offer a broader array of games that's competitive with our peers that are out there. We expect that will take place before the end of this year. And so then we can talk with, frankly, more relevant as to what's happening in iCasino. We continue to perform strongly in New Jersey and iCasino, but we have not pushed a launch in iCasino beyond New Jersey today. 
So in summary, we're extremely encouraged, both brick and mortar. And one thing I should say about wrapping this digital business into the physical enterprise, the employees that have leaned just done an outstanding job of leaning into this launch for us and Caesars Rewards activating the database, this is not something where you just flip a switch. This is going to continue to build momentum as the quarters pile up. We -- I think we've done a good job of getting our message out there, getting our brand out there, and we're encouraged to see the customers respond. 
And with that, I'll flip to Bret."

On September 9, we announced an agreement to sell the non-U.S. assets of William Hill to 888 Holdings for GBP 2.2 billion. Following repayment of debt, we will receive net proceeds of approximately USD 1.2 billion. We expect this transaction will close during the first quarter of 2022. 
On September 10, we priced $1.2 billion of new unsecured notes at a [ 4 5/8% ] coupon, and we repriced $1.8 billion of CRC loan B at LIBOR plus 350, a decrease of 100 bps. Proceeds from the new notes alongside $500 million of cash on hand were used to fully retire $1.7 billion of existing CRC notes. 
In late September and October, we continued to use excess cash on hand to permanently repay debt through $100 million of open market purchases of our exiting [ 8 ] notes. Aggregate year-to-date debt reduction is approaching $1 billion, which has resulted in approximately $75 million of annualized interest expense savings. 
Net proceeds from the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. business will be applied to debt reduction in the first half of 2022, yielding further interest expense savings and enhance free cash flow. Our 2021 calendar year CapEx spend, excluding Atlantic City, is now $350 million to $400 million, which includes approximately $75 million for Caesars Digital. This is simply a shift in timing of planned CapEx from 2021 to 2022, driven in part by the hurricane that impacted our New Orleans expansion and COVID-related supply shortage. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

And to talk a little bit about '22, when we closed the Caesars transaction, obviously, we closed into an uncertain environment with a highly leveraged capital structure. And we needed to bridge to the point where we'd be generating a lot of free cash flow to pay down that debt. You heard Bret talk about the beginnings of that in '21. '22 Is going to be a massive cash flow generation -- cash generation and deployment year for As Bret said, we've got the William Hill asset sale settling between the William Hill non-U.S. business, the NeoGames sale, we've got about $1.5 billion of proceeds to deploy, the bulk of which will be coming in '22. We're generating in the brick-and-mortar business, something in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year of free cash flow right now. And so if you're looking from now until -- from end of third quarter to end of '22, you're well over $2 billion of cash there. 
We also think this is an opportune time to execute on our strategy of a strip asset sale. So you should expect us to put that in motion in the early part of '22. And if you look at all of -- and as Bret said, you should expect us to be aggressive on the refinancing front in '22 as well, which should dramatically lower our cost of debt. 
And so if you add all of those up, we should have well in excess of $5 billion of cash to deploy in '22. Some of that will be spent in the digital business. And some of that will be spent on capital projects that drive ROI in the portfolio. But the vast majority of that cash is going to go to pay down debt, where we can be in a position to be pushing almost half of our conventional debt off the balance sheet and ultimately reducing our cash interest expense by the end of '22 to $300 million or $400 million a year less than it was when we closed the transaction. 
So we are extraordinarily excited for what's to come. in '22. Happy -- very happy with the results that we're reporting to you today and happy to answer any questions that you have.

The third quarter of '21 was another strong quarter. We delivered $1.04 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, which represented a quarterly record for our brick-and-mortar properties. 31 of our 51 properties set a record for the highest third quarter EBITDA, while 32 set a record for the highest Q3 EBITDA margin. 
Starting with Las Vegas. Demand trends remained exceptionally strong through the quarter, leading to an all-time quarterly record of $500 million in adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment. Excluding real rent payments, EBITDA improved 44% versus the third quarter of 2019, and margins improved 1,400 basis points to 50%. Total occupancy for Q3 was 89%, with weekend occupancy at 97% and midweek occupancy 86%.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends into 2022 and beyond. While group attrition remains higher than normal, we began to see conventions return to Las Vegas in the third quarter, and the segment represented approximately 10% of occupied room nights, a dramatic improvement versus the first half of '21. We continue to expect to see a gradual recovery in the segment leading into next year, and we are encouraged as group and convention revenues on the books for '22 continue to pace nicely ahead of '19. 
Demand for the CAESARS FORUM is exceeding the original underwriting expectations, with over 175 events booked currently, representing 1.8 million room nights and over $650 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is new to Caesars. 
Turning to our regional markets. Operating results remained strong, especially in markets not impacted by severe natural disaster events. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding New Orleans, Lake Tahoe and Lake Charles, increased 35% versus 2019, with margins improving by 860 bps to 38%. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest third quarter EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 
In our Caesars Digital segment, we generated over $3 billion of volume, $96 million of net revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $164 million. Sports betting and iCasino handle was split roughly 55-45. 90% of our handle was from mobile sports betting and iCasino. We are laser focused on scaling our digital business through aggressive customer acquisition during our first fall sports season post launch of our Caesars branded apps in 9 states. 
While customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, net revenues were negatively impacted by directed promotional investment in odds and profit boost, competitive pricing strategies and lower-than-historical hold in certain markets. We are pleased that our sports betting handle share in the 8 states operating on Liberty platform has increased to 12% through September. Arizona has not reported and is therefore not included in these stats. 
Our national market share through September, including all legalized sports betting states sits at 17%. Following the exciting launch of retail sports betting in Louisiana on Sunday, we now offer sports betting in 20 jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile. Importantly, we expect to complete the migration of our legacy apps in Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania and Illinois to our Liberty platform in 2022. 
We are also excited to be rolling out enhanced iCasino offerings in the fourth quarter following anticipated regulatory approvals related to the release of new games in New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia. Our expanded game portfolio will be accompanied by significant improvements to our in-app marketing technologies. 
On the development front, we are making great progress on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the fourth quarter of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace is making great progress, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience sometime in Q1 of '22. 
In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion in Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of '22. And finally, in Atlantic City, our $400 million capital plan is actively moving forward with remodeling room towers and setting the stage for exciting new food and beverage and entertainment options. 
As we look to 2022, we see several tailwinds in our business, and we remain optimistic about further visitation gains as consumers return to our property once COVID fears have fully subsided. We remain confident in the eventual return of the convention customer to Las Vegas and our destination markets. 
Lastly, we are excited to rebrand a handful of our properties in 2022 using flagship brands from the Caesars portfolio to even further elevate the customer experience. I am extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during this third quarter. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter."
3133890,1683578377,2422226,"Caesars Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Caesars Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everybody. We pre-released for our bond deal earlier in the quarter. So you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations effectively.

So you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations effectively. So I'm going to be lighter on comments on brick-and-mortar and go a little deeper into Digital. 
On the brick-and-mortar side, if Ida didn't hit New Orleans and we didn't have the Caldor Fire in Tahoe, we would have done $1.1 billion of brick-and-mortar EBITDA in the quarter. We had an extremely strong quarter. Demand remains particularly robust. 
In regards to New Orleans and Tahoe, Tahoe has pretty quickly recovered back to above 2019 levels, not quite as strong as it was pre-fire but continuing to build. In New Orleans, recall that we have significant operating leverage there that works in both directions. You've got a minimum guaranteed tax payment to the state and the city in Louisiana. So New Orleans EBITDA continues to trail '19, although it is continuing to recover as well. Going into the storm, we were doing $11 million, $12 million a month in EBITDA out of New Orleans, and now we're more like $5 million or $6 million and building. 
Vegas had a record quarter, beating the record of the second quarter. So $424 million went to $500 million of EBITDA, $511 million, adding back the real rent payment. As Anthony said, we were 50% margin again. That was in spite of us imposing occupancy caps midweek so that we could calibrate the supply with our housekeeping services. We are struggling across the country to hire guest room attendance. Vegas is no exception. 
So even with the operating caps, we set a quarterly EBITDA record. In October, Vegas had the strongest EBITDA month in the history of Caesars. So the strength has continued into October, regionals as well. We're still pacing up in the neighborhood of 40% over '19. 
So feel very good about the setup going into '22. Customer demand remains strong. Obviously, the virus numbers have subsided considerably over the past 6 to 8 weeks, and we're seeing some pickup in demand as that rolls through. 
For Digital, I spoke to Digital in the second quarter call in terms of what you should expect from us. As I said, we anticipated investing in terms of cumulative EBITDA losses north of $1 billion into the Digital segment and generating cash-on-cash EBITDA returns at maturity north of 50%. And what we saw in terms of opportunity for us was the ability to activate our 50-plus properties, our 50,000-plus employees and, most importantly, our 65 million strong Caesars Rewards database. And that's what we set out to do. 
So as I go through these numbers, I'm going to talk about how I look at this business in terms of measuring what we're doing versus expectations. I would -- even though we're extremely encouraged that the numbers that I'm going to be talking about are ahead of our internal expectations as we launch this, it's very early, and this is a long game. So we expect it to not be a straight line. 
But what we anticipated was in states where we offered our Liberty technology, where we were starting on equal footing and where we had existing strong database, that those would be our most effective markets. And that describes Arizona to a T, which launched during the quarter, has not published results yet, but we think that the results will show us in excess of the handle number -- percentage numbers that Anthony described earlier. 
In the Liberty states in total -- and I'm looking at handle because in the current customer acquisition environment, hold is volatile not just because of the results of the sporting events but because of the boost and the promotions that you offer. So when I talk about share, I'm talking about handle share. So in our Liberty states, handle share has almost doubled since launch. That's in the 6s to about 12% mobile market share. That's without Arizona. As I said, I'd expect that to exceed the average and bring it higher. 
Arizona is our second -- our third strongest state behind Nevada and Iowa, where we have incumbent advantages, and that reflects exactly what we expected. States where we launched but we were late to the game but did have Liberty, we're seeing continued build in market share on the order of 200 to 500 basis points depending on the market since we launched. 
Importantly, if you're looking at analysis that looks at market share across the entire U.S. market, realize that we are not competing for the time being in Pennsylvania and Illinois, which are 2 of the biggest markets out there. When we launched, the Liberty platform was not approved in either state. It will be approved in the first half of 2022 is our expectation. But we didn't want to spend money guiding customers to an experience that would not be what we wanted to offer them. And so you see our share in those markets sucks for lack of a better term. 
If you look at where our customers are coming from, when you're spending like we're spending on advertising and promotion, you're going to get lots and lots of customers that show up at your door. A lot of them are not going to be worth a lot of value. If you look at our customer by count, Caesars Rewards customers are somewhere around 1/3 of our total new deposits since we relaunched. By handle, Caesars Rewards customers are about half of our handle since relaunch. So validating that we think Caesars built a system over 2 decades that identified the valuable customers that everyone is out there searching for. We're seeing that in our experience, and that's extremely encouraging as we look to the future. 
The performance in Arizona, also encouraging as we look to states like Louisiana, which just launched retail on Sunday. We'll launch mobile in the near future. Maryland will come online soon as well. These are states where we're in a similar position to where we were in Arizona, so we'd expect to perform well. 
When we show -- when we give you our 17% total market share, that's everything. That's the states we're not doing well in like Pennsylvania and Illinois that are not Liberty states, but also includes Nevada, which is not a Liberty state where we have tremendous market share. We're not adding fantasy numbers in there. We're not adding a horse racing business in there. We're showing you pure sports betting handle. And if you think about what we did in sports in the quarter, our handle for the third quarter was a little under $1.7 billion -- I'm sorry, a little over $1.7 billion for the full quarter. In October alone, we did over $1.3 billion of handle. So we think we're continuing to generate momentum. 
And when I talk about the return on investment, obviously, we had a model that showed where we expected to get in market share and the pace at which we expected to get there. So you can see from the EBITDA loss that it's relatively in line with what we were telling people to expect, but our ramp in market share has exceeded our expectations in terms of its pace. 
Now the question to that is, does that mean there's a broader market -- bigger market share number down the road? And the candid answer is we don't know right now. But what we do know is we're gaining share at a pace stronger than we expected given the investment that we've made. So encouraging results from sports. 
In iCasino, if you want to think about somewhere where we have tracked a little bit below plan, we inherited a platform in iCasino that was noncompetitive from a game offering standpoint. And so again, we've not spent money advertising and promoting our iCasino business until we get the approvals we need to offer a broader array of games that's competitive with our peers that are out there. We expect that will take place before the end of this year. And so then we can talk with, frankly, more relevance as to what's happening in iCasino. We continue to perform strongly in New Jersey in iCasino, but we have not pushed a launch in iCasino beyond New Jersey today. 
So in summary, we're extremely encouraged, both brick-and-mortar -- and one thing I should say about wrapping this Digital business into the physical enterprise, the employees that have leaned just done an outstanding job of leaning into this launch for us and Caesars Rewards activating the database, this is not something where you just flip a switch. This is going to continue to build momentum as the quarters pile up. We -- I think we've done a good job of getting our message out there, getting our brand out there, and we're encouraged to see the customers respond. 
And with that, I'll flip to Bret."

On September 9, we announced an agreement to sell the non-U.S. assets of William Hill to 888 Holdings for GBP 2.2 billion. Following repayment of debt, we will receive net proceeds of approximately USD 1.2 billion. We expect this transaction will close during the first quarter of 2022. 
On September 10, we priced $1.2 billion of new unsecured notes at a 4 5/8% coupon. And we repriced $1.8 billion of CRC term loan B at LIBOR plus 350, a decrease of 100 bps. Proceeds from the new notes alongside $500 million of cash on hand were used to fully retire $1.7 billion of existing CRC notes. 
In late September and October, we continued to use excess cash on hand to permanently repay debt through $100 million of open market purchases of our existing 8 1/8% notes. Aggregate year-to-date debt reduction is approaching $1 billion, which has resulted in approximately $75 million of annualized interest expense savings. 
Net proceeds from the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. business will be applied to debt reduction in the first half of 2022, yielding further interest expense savings and enhance free cash flow. Our 2021 calendar year CapEx spend, excluding Atlantic City, is now $350 million to $400 million, which includes approximately $75 million for Caesars Digital. This is simply a shift in timing of planned CapEx from 2021 to 2022, driven in part by the hurricane that impacted our New Orleans expansion and COVID-related supply shortage. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Tom."

And to talk a little bit about '22, when we closed the Caesars transaction, obviously, we closed into an uncertain environment with a highly leveraged capital structure. And we needed to bridge to the point where we'd be generating a lot of free cash flow to pay down that debt. 
You heard Bret talk about the beginnings of that in '21. '22 is going to be a massive cash flow generation -- cash generation and deployment year for the company. As Bret said, we've got the William Hill asset sale settling. Between the William Hill non-U.S. business, the NeoGames sale, we've got about $1.5 billion of proceeds to deploy, the bulk of which will be coming in '22. We're generating in the brick-and-mortar business something in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year of free cash flow right now. And so if you're looking from now until -- from end of third quarter to end of '22, you're well over $2 billion of cash there. 
We also think this is an opportune time to execute on our strategy of a strip asset sale. So you should expect us to put that in motion in the early part of '22. And if you look at all of -- and as Bret said, you should expect us to be aggressive on the refinancing front in '22 as well, which should dramatically lower our cost of debt. 
And so if you add all of those up, we should have well in excess of $5 billion of cash to deploy in '22. Some of that will be spent in the Digital business. Some of that will be spent on capital projects that drive ROI in the portfolio. But the vast majority of that cash is going to go to pay down debt, where we can be in a position to be pushing almost half of our conventional debt off the balance sheet and ultimately reducing our cash interest expense by the end of '22 to $300 million or $400 million a year less than it was when we closed the transaction. 
So we are extraordinarily excited for what's to come in '22. Happy -- very happy with the results that we're reporting to you today. And happy to answer any questions that you have.
