And thank you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy to capitalize on the very attractive long-term growth trends we see for our businesses.

On today's call, I will highlight recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy to capitalize on the very attractive long-term growth trends we see for our businesses. Scott will give more detail on our results, outlook and capital allocation. 
I'm pleased to say that Albemarle reported solid fourth quarter results, including net sales of $879 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $221 million, both of which were at or above the high end of our previous outlook. I'm also encouraged by the rebound we began to see in the second half of the year, particularly for bromine and lithium. We expect to generate full year 2021 net sales of between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $810 million and $860 million, both up from 2020 results. As I'm sure you're aware, earlier this month, we completed a $1.5 billion capital raise. The proceeds of this offering provide the financial flexibility to execute our long-term strategy, including the acceleration of high-return growth projects. 
Now if we turn to Slide 5. We have a clear strategy to drive sustainable value for our shareholders. Albemarle has 4 primary strategic objectives: first, we will grow profitably. We have identified and planned a portfolio of low capital intensity, high-return projects. These projects lever our diverse world-class resources in both lithium and bromine. Over the past 5 years, we have built the internal team and capabilities to execute these projects on time and on budget. In addition, we have the long-term commercial relationships with customers that are required for these projects. We are working to ensure that we are aligning with their strategic requirements while achieving adequate returns for our shareholders. Of course, the majority of our growth will be in lithium, but at the same time, we will be investing in our bromine projects. This will include highly efficient brownfield projects with attractive returns and short paybacks. I'm sure Netha would be happy to give you more detail when we get to Q&A. 
Second, we will maximize productivity. Over the past year, we have optimized earnings and cash flow generation across our business, including our very successful sustainable cost savings program. Operational discipline is essential for generating cash flow and supporting growth, and we will not take our eyes off the ball even as we move into an accelerated growth phase. 
Third, we will invest with discipline, focusing our capital investments on our highest return opportunities. Just as we have in the past, we will actively assess our portfolio for opportunities to unlock shareholder value. We will also continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. 
Fourth and finally, we will advance sustainability across our businesses, which is a core value -- which is a core value for Albemarle. Our aim is to increase sustainability throughout the value chain from the resource to the end-use of our products. Most recognizably, we developed lithium products that enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of battery electric vehicles. Our catalyst business contributes to sustainability by helping refiners produce cleaner transportation fuels, and our bromine products contribute to consumer safety by preventing fires and electronic equipment. With continued regulatory changes, advancements in technology and investments in infrastructure like charging stations, the current environment is ideal for a step change in EV adoption. We are seeing this play out in the acceleration of global EV sales led by rebounding demand in China and new demand in Europe. Global EV sales increased 45% during 2020 and are expected to increase by over 70% in 2021. On the right-hand side of the slide, you see demand projections for lithium over the next 5 to 10 years. Based on our internal estimates, we believe demand will reach more than 1.1 million tons by 2025, up from around 300,000 tons today. This is slightly higher than third-party projections from industry analysts like Benchmark Minerals, Roskill and the CRU Group. But as you can see, the consensus is that the industry expects to see significant growth in the coming years. As the industry leader in lithium, Albemarle is able to take these external estimates, internal forecast and discussions with our strategic customers and suppliers to generate a detailed demand forecast. 
On Slide 7, you see other metrics we use to gauge the future of the lithium market. While Albemarle's demand outlook for lithium is above third-party estimates, our outlook is below some of the more ambitious targets from automotive OEMs. For example, Tesla's vision of 3 terawatt hours of battery production by 2030 would translate to roughly 2.3 million tons of lithium. That means that Tesla's demand alone would exceed estimates for the entire market. Additional regulatory impacts, for example, if the U.S. decides to adopt more European like EV incentives would be incremental to our estimates. Total lithium demand is expected to grow by about 30% per year from 2020 to 2025, led by lithium consumption electric vehicles, which is expected to grow by 47% per year. 2 other trends support lithium demand, increased adoption of battery electric vehicles and larger battery size. Battery electric vehicles and larger battery size improved the consumer experience with longer driving ranges and innovation in batteries is also driving shorter charging times. It's important to note that this outlook does not assume a major shift in battery technologies over the next 5 years. Advanced battery technologies like solid-state batteries could potentially increase lithium intensity later this decade. Since 2015, we've nearly tripled our nameplate conversion capacity to 85,000 tons per year. Later this year, we expect to complete 2 major projects, which we refer to as wave 2. Wave 2 consists of our La Negra III and IV project and Kemerton 1 and 2 projects, which will more than double our current capacity to 175,000 tons per year. Over the last 5 years, we engaged with our customers with long-term volume commitments to execute this portfolio of projects. Now with this new acceleration in demand, customers are asking us to repeat the model. Our next 2 waves of expansion could once again more than double our nameplate capacity. With lower capital intensity, we expect these projects to generate very attractive returns. The identified and planned wave 3 projects would add 150,000 tons of annual capacity over the next 3 to 5 years. And this third wave includes a conversion plant in China, which would be part of our MARBL joint venture, a smaller expansion at our Silver Peak asset in Nevada, another plant in China on a new mega site and Kemerton 3 and 4, a brownfield project in Australia. We also have identified opportunities for a fourth wave of projects. These could include further expansions in Australia, China and Southeast Asia and the potential to restart the mine and expand our conversion facility at Kings Mountain in North Carolina. Wave 4 also includes options to support customers looking to localize supply, for example, by converting carbonate to hydroxide near battery manufacturer. 
And before we continue, let me update you on our Wave 2 projects. So La Negra III and IV enables us to add lithium carbonate capacity at the very low end of the cost curve. The project remains on track for mechanical completion in mid-2021. Kemerton 1 and 2, our new lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Western Australia is on track to reach mechanical completion late in 2021. Kemerton is core to our hydroxide capacity in line with expected strong long-term market demand. Both of these projects will add significant commercial lithium sales beginning in 2022, following commissioning and customer qualification processes. As we move from wave 2 to wave 3 projects and beyond, we expect an estimated 40% reduction in capital intensity to support compelling economic returns. We can achieve these capital efficiencies and returns for 3 key reasons. First, we were able to leverage our experience in project execution by building standardized plants with economies of scale. For example, we expect new hydroxide plant would be a standard 2 trains or 50,000 tons per year, similar to what we are building at Kemerton today. Second, in many cases, we're moving from greenfield to brownfield economics. Just as today, we're moving from La Negra I and II to La Negra III and IV. Likewise, we'll move from Kemerton 1 and 2 to Kemerton 3 and 4 and so on. As with Kemerton, the focus will be on building what we call mega sites. Standardized large-scale plants able to support multiple trains for lithium conversion. Finally, we'll be buying or building additional facilities in low-cost jurisdictions. As we did when we successfully acquired and then expanded our Xinyu facility in China in 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Scott to review recent results, I'd like to acknowledge all the hard work by our Albemarle team to continue to operate during the global pandemic as well as their ability to achieve significant progress on our long-term strategy. A year ago, when my predecessor laid out our 2020 strategic objectives, I don't think any of us could have imagined how the year would play out. Despite all the challenges, our team has delivered. We set ourselves up to grow profitably, keeping our major lithium capital projects on track for 2021 completion. We maximize productivity, achieving $80 million of sustainable cost savings in 2020, 60% above our initial targets. We demonstrated financial discipline, completing our 26th consecutive year of dividend increases and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating throughout the pandemic related downturn. And finally, we improved the sustainability of our businesses by establishing baseline environmental data and improving our reporting and transparency. 
Now I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a detailed review of the 2020 financial results."
18671,700977482,2215308,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Albemarle generated fourth quarter net sales of over $879 million, a decrease of about 11% compared to the prior year. But at the high end of our previous outlook. This reduction was primarily due to reduced price",1228,"Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Albemarle generated fourth quarter net sales of over $879 million, a decrease of about 11% compared to the prior year. But at the high end of our previous outlook. This reduction was primarily due to reduced prices in lithium as expected coming into the year and reduced volumes in catalysts, offset by improvements in bromine. GAAP net income was $85 million, adjusted EPS of $1.17 excludes a pension mark-to-market loss due to lower discount rates. As Kent stated, adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, above the high end of our previous outlook. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business segment. Lithium's EBITDA declined by $17 million versus the prior year. Pricing was down about 20% in the quarter due to contract pricing adjustments agreed in late 2019 as well as product mix. Volumes were higher-than-expected due to a combination of improving demand and customers for filling their full year contract commitments. Cost savings to help offset the impact of lower prices. Bromine's EBITDA was up about $7 million. The increase was due to higher volumes and higher pricing. Bromine is overall a good news story. The business has essentially rebounded to pre pandemic levels. In Q4, they benefited from higher demand, customer restocking and some short-term supply demand imbalances for both raw materials and finished goods. Catalyst EBITDA declined by $53 million, primarily due to lower volumes. This business continues to be the most challenged of the 3 due to ongoing travel restrictions as well as reduced refinery capacity utilization and margins. Fluid catalyst cracking or FCC volume improved sequentially, but remained down compared to the prior year quarter. Hydroprocessing catalyst or HPC volumes were also down with a tough comparable relative to an unusually strong Q4 2019. Our corporate and other category EBITDA decreased by $8 million due to a mix of slightly lower fine chemistry services results and slightly higher corporate costs. The FCS business is contract driven and can vary quarter-to-quarter. Full year results were very strong compared to history. Comparing the full year to fourth quarter, you can see it and get a sense of the rebound we started to see in the second half of 2020, particularly for lithium and bromine. We are pivoting capital allocation to prioritize high-return growth projects to align with strategic customer demand and maintain our leadership positions. We remain committed to preserving the financial flexibility necessary to fund growth and to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. We'll also continue to support our dividend although dividend growth may be lower than the historical average, while we build out the next wave of growth projects that will enable high return opportunities. Finally, we will pursue a disciplined and thoughtful approach to investments, including M&A and joint ventures. As we've said in the past, the most likely M&A you'd see us do would be bolt-on acquisitions of lithium conversion assets in cases where buying allows us to grow more quickly. And generate better returns than building. We are finalizing the sale of our Fine Chemistry Services and Performance Catalyst Solutions businesses and expect to update you in the coming months. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 for a look at our balance sheet. The primary use of proceeds from our equity offering is to accelerate profitable growth. The 90% -- or about 90% of the proceeds are for lithium growth, with most of the remainder for enhancements to our bromine business. The returns on these projects are highly attractive. And we expect to generate returns at least 2x our weighted average cost of capital at mid-cycle pricing. These are large, long-dated projects with the bulk of incremental spending in 2022 through 2025. In the meantime, instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we plan to delever which will reduce interest expense and cash drag on the balance sheet. This will enable us to use cash and debt capacity to fund investments as they are approved. Our long-term target net leverage ratio remains 2x to 2.5x adjusted EBITDA. Pro forma for the offering, we are below that range but expect to increase our leverage as needed to accelerate growth and deliver returns to shareholders. Overall, we expect 2021 results to improve year-over-year. For the total company, we expect net sales to be higher year-over-year as our businesses continue to recover from the events of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA of between $810 million and $860 million also suggests potential upside compared to 2020 due to higher net sales and ongoing cost savings. We expect CapEx to be slightly higher year-over-year as we begin to execute our accelerated growth projects. However, as I mentioned earlier, the bulk of that spending for these projects will be in 2022 to 2025. Net cash from operations is expected to be lower due to higher cash taxes and higher inventories as we start-up the 2 new lithium plants. Expectations for adjusted diluted EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 is lower than last year due to higher taxes and depreciation as well as the increased share count. Due to the recent severe winter weather, we have temporarily shut down 4 of our U.S. plants. Our Bayport, Pasadena, Magnolia, Aton Rouge plants have been down since Monday. Once it is safe to do so, we will restart these facilities. And this situation is still evolving. At this point, we expect some impact to Q1 results and potentially Q2. And it's possible that weather will have more of an impact than what is currently included in this outlook, and we'll update you if there are any material changes. 
Let's turn to Slide 17. Lithium results are expected to be relatively flat compared to 2020. We expect slightly higher volumes with the restart of North American production late last year, as well as modest efficiency improvements. As usual, we expect volumes to be back half weighted for lithium. At this point, we still anticipate slightly lower pricing depending on full year average realized pricing for carbonate and technical grade products. Our new contract structures provide increased flexibility to increase price in response to improving market prices. Lithium costs will be slightly higher year-over-year related to the start-up cost associated with La Negra and Kemerton, partially offset by continued cost and efficiency improvements. And as Kent discussed, the long-term growth story for lithium is intact. In Catalyst, we expect 2021 results to be flat year-over-year, including higher PCS earnings. We expect a decline in North American refining catalyst volume. This is primarily a result of 1 customer who recently indicated that they would deselect Albemarle's catalysis due to our public support for electric vehicles. Longer term, we are continuing to position the catalyst business to grow in emerging markets and capitalize on our strengths as a global specialty chemicals producer in the crude to chemicals market and the renewable fuels market. Raphael can give more color on the challenges and opportunities we see for our catalyst business during Q&A. In bromine, we expect full year 2021 results to improve modestly with continued economic recovery and return to sold out plants. Our ongoing savings initiatives should offset the impact of inflation. 
Looking ahead, we see steady demand increases for our flagship fire safety products, driven by new technology trends like 5G and electric vehicles. 
I'll turn it back to Kent to review our strategic objectives for 2021."

So on the upward revisions here, 2025 lithium demand forecast, you pointed to, obviously, to EV penetration and the mix of EVs, larger batteries as the drivers. I'm just wondering if you could provide color on on the outlook from a hydroxide versus carbonate standpoint. I'm just curious if the upward revision is tied to higher energy density EVs and therefore, more skewed towards hydroxide?"

So relative to the demand question, the mix, it is weighted towards hydroxide. If you look at the market today, we see it being sort of a 30-70 split by the 30% hydroxide, that would be that value.

If you look at the market today, we see it being sort of a 30-70 split by the 30% hydroxide, that would be that value. And if you look out to 2025, and there's going to be some error bars on this, of course, but it's about 60-40, 60% hydroxide. So the large part of the growth is in hydroxide high nickel chemistries. It's not to say there isn't growth in carbonate for more conventional technologies like LFP, but to enable the growth targets of the western OEMs, in particular, and the range they're looking for energy density, it's going to be hydroxide. And that's true even in 2021. The rate of growth we see for demand in '21 is incrementally higher for hydroxide than it's for carbonate. And as you know, Albemarle is well positioned no matter which way it goes because we have capacity coming on, and we're doubling our capacity in both product lines. As we roll forward and look at Wave 3, the predominance of that is going to go towards hydroxide for the reasons I just referenced."

The carbonate delta on carbonate and the inversion of carbonate being higher than historically, hydroxide is a $1 or $2 lower. We think that's a dislocation of a rapidly responding China market, which is largely carbonate and not a long time trend. It's important to understand that a lot of the hydroxide market is supplied by low-cost brine producers, of which Albemarle one is on converting to hydroxide, which is what we do at Kings Mountain. And without that supply, there's not enough market, there's enough volume for the marketplace. So the point is that the economics say that there has to be that incentive for those producers to go to hydroxide. So we expect that to revert, and we are obviously very well positioned in both product lines to participate.

And thank you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy to capitalize on the very attractive long-term growth trends we see for our businesses. Scott will give more detail",1626,"Thanks, Meredith. And thank you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy to capitalize on the very attractive long-term growth trends we see for our businesses. Scott will give more detail on our results, outlook and capital allocation.  
I'm pleased to say that Albemarle reported solid fourth quarter results, including net sales of $879 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $221 million, both of which were at or above the high end of our previous outlook. I'm also encouraged by the rebound we began to see in the second half of the year, particularly for bromine and lithium. We expect to generate full year 2021 net sales of between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $810 million and $860 million, both up from 2020 results. As I'm sure you're aware, earlier this month, we completed a $1.5 billion capital raise. The proceeds of this offering provide the financial flexibility to execute our long-term strategy, including the acceleration of high-return growth projects.  
Now if we turn to Slide 5. We have a clear strategy to drive sustainable value for our shareholders. Albemarle has 4 primary strategic objectives: first, we will grow profitably. We have identified and planned a portfolio of low capital intensity, high-return projects. These projects lever our diverse world-class resources in both lithium and bromine. Over the past 5 years, we have built the internal team and capabilities to execute these projects on time and on budget. In addition, we have the long-term commercial relationships with customers that are required for these projects. We are working to ensure that we are aligning with their strategic requirements while achieving adequate returns for our shareholders. Of course, the majority of our growth will be in lithium, but at the same time, we will be investing in our bromine projects. This will include highly efficient brownfield projects with attractive returns and short paybacks. I'm sure Netha would be happy to give you more detail when we get to Q&A.  
Second, we will maximize productivity. Over the past year, we have optimized earnings and cash flow generation across our business, including our very successful sustainable cost savings program. Operational discipline is essential for generating cash flow and supporting growth, and we will not take our eyes off the ball even as we move into an accelerated growth phase.  
Third, we will invest with discipline, focusing our capital investments on our highest return opportunities. Just as we have in the past, we will actively assess our portfolio for opportunities to unlock shareholder value. We will also continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend.  
Fourth and finally, we will advance sustainability across our businesses, which is a core value for Albemarle. Our aim is to increase sustainability throughout the value chain from the resource to the end-use of our products. Most recognizably, we developed lithium products that enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of battery electric vehicles. Our Catalyst business contributes to sustainability by helping refiners produce cleaner transportation fuels, and our bromine products contribute to consumer safety by preventing fires in electronic equipment. With continued regulatory changes, advancements in technology and investments in infrastructure like charging stations, the current environment is ideal for a step change in EV adoption. We are seeing this play out in the acceleration of global EV sales led by rebounding demand in China and new demand in Europe. Global EV sales increased 45% during 2020 and are expected to increase by over 70% in 2021. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, you see demand projections for lithium over the next 5 to 10 years. Based on our internal estimates, we believe demand will reach more than 1.1 million tons by 2025, up from around 300,000 tons today. This is slightly higher than third-party projections from industry analysts like Benchmark Minerals, Roskill and the CRU Group. But as you can see, the consensus is that the industry expects to see significant growth in the coming years. As the industry leader in lithium, Albemarle is able to take these external estimates, internal forecast and discussions with our strategic customers and suppliers to generate a detailed demand forecast.  
On Slide 7, you see other metrics we use to gauge the future of the lithium market. While Albemarle's demand outlook for lithium is above third-party estimates, our outlook is below some of the more ambitious targets from automotive OEMs. For example, Tesla's vision of 3 terawatt hours of battery production by 2030 would translate to roughly 2.3 million tons of lithium. That means that Tesla's demand alone would exceed estimates for the entire market. Additional regulatory impacts, for example, if the U.S. decides to adopt more European like EV incentives would be incremental to our estimates. Total lithium demand is expected to grow by about 30% per year from 2020 to 2025, led by lithium consumption electric vehicles, which is expected to grow by 47% per year. 2 other trends support lithium demand, increased adoption of battery electric vehicles and larger battery size. Battery electric vehicles and larger battery size improved the consumer experience with longer driving ranges and innovation in batteries is also driving shorter charging times. 
It's important to note that this outlook does not assume a major shift in battery technologies over the next 5 years. Advanced battery technologies like solid-state batteries could potentially increase lithium intensity later this decade. Since 2015, we've nearly tripled our nameplate conversion capacity to 85,000 tons per year. Later this year, we expect to complete 2 major projects, which we refer to as Wave II. Wave II consists of our La Negra III and IV project and Kemerton I and II projects, which will more than double our current capacity to 175,000 tons per year. Over the last 5 years, we engaged with our customers with long-term volume commitments to execute this portfolio of projects. Now with this new acceleration in demand, customers are asking us to repeat the model. Our next 2 waves of expansion could once again more than double our nameplate capacity. With lower capital intensity, we expect these projects to generate very attractive returns. The identified and planned Wave III projects would add 150,000 tons of annual capacity over the next 3 to 5 years. And this third wave includes a conversion plant in China, which would be part of our MARBL joint venture. A smaller expansion at our Silver Peak asset in Nevada, another plant in China on a new mega site and Kemerton III and IV, a brownfield project in Australia. 
We also have identified opportunities for a fourth wave of projects. These could include further expansions in Australia, China and Southeast Asia and the potential to restart the mine and expand our conversion facility at Kings Mountain in North Carolina. Wave IV also includes options to support customers looking to localize supply, for example, by converting carbonate to hydroxide near battery manufacturer.  
And before we continue, let me update you on our Wave II projects. So La Negra III and IV enables us to add lithium carbonate capacity at the very low end of the cost curve. The project remains on track for mechanical completion in mid-2021. Kemerton I and II, our new lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Western Australia is on track to reach mechanical completion late in 2021. Kemerton is core to our hydroxide capacity in line with expected strong long-term market demand. Both of these projects will add significant commercial lithium sales beginning in 2022, following commissioning and customer qualification processes. As we move from Wave II to Wave III projects and beyond, we expect an estimated 40% reduction in capital intensity to support compelling economic returns. We can achieve these capital efficiencies and returns for 3 key reasons. First, we were able to leverage our experience in project execution by building standardized plants with economies of scale. For example, we expect new hydroxide plant would be a standard 2 trains or 50,000 tons per year, similar to what we are building at Kemerton today. Second, in many cases, we're moving from greenfield to brownfield economics. Just as today, we're moving from La Negra I and II to La Negra III and IV. Likewise, we'll move from Kemerton I and II to Kemerton III and IV and so on. As with Kemerton, the focus will be on building what we call mega sites. Standardized large-scale plants able to support multiple trains for lithium conversion. Finally, we'll be buying or building additional facilities in low-cost jurisdictions. As we did when we successfully acquired and then expanded our Xinyu facility in China in 2016.  
Before I turn it over to Scott to review recent results, I'd like to acknowledge all the hard work by our Albemarle team to continue to operate during the global pandemic as well as their ability to achieve significant progress on our long-term strategy. A year ago, when my predecessor laid out our 2020 strategic objectives, I don't think any of us could have imagined how the year would play out. Despite all the challenges, our team has delivered. We set ourselves up to grow profitably, keeping our major lithium capital projects on track for 2021 completion. We maximize productivity, achieving $80 million of sustainable cost savings in 2020, 60% above our initial targets. We demonstrated financial discipline, completing our 26th consecutive year of dividend increases and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating throughout the pandemic related downturn. And finally, we improved the sustainability of our businesses by establishing baseline environmental data and improving our reporting and transparency.  
Now -- I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a detailed review of the 2020 financial results."
18671,700977482,2215483,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Albemarle generated fourth quarter net sales of over $879 million, a decrease of about 11% compared to the prior year. But at the high end of our previous outlook. This reduction was primarily due to reduced price",1230,"Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Albemarle generated fourth quarter net sales of over $879 million, a decrease of about 11% compared to the prior year. But at the high end of our previous outlook. This reduction was primarily due to reduced prices in lithium as expected coming into the year and reduced volumes in catalysts, offset by improvements in bromine. GAAP net income was $85 million, adjusted EPS of $1.17 excludes a pension mark-to-market loss due to lower discount rates. As Kent stated, adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, above the high end of our previous outlook.  
Turning to Slide 13 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business segment. Lithium's EBITDA declined by $17 million versus the prior year. Pricing was down about 20% in the quarter due to contract pricing adjustments agreed in late 2019 as well as product mix. Volumes were higher-than-expected due to a combination of improving demand and customers for filling their full year contract commitments. Cost savings to help offset the impact of lower prices. Bromine's EBITDA was up about $7 million. The increase was due to higher volumes and higher pricing. Bromine is overall a good news story. The business has essentially rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. In Q4, they benefited from higher demand, customer restocking and some short-term supply demand imbalances for both raw materials and finished goods. Catalyst EBITDA declined by $53 million, primarily due to lower volumes. This business continues to be the most challenged of the 3 due to ongoing travel restrictions as well as reduced refinery capacity utilization and margins. Fluid catalytic cracking or FCC volume improved sequentially, but remained down compared to the prior year quarter. Hydroprocessing catalyst or HPC volumes were also down with a tough comparable relative to an unusually strong Q4 2019. Our corporate and other category EBITDA decreased by $8 million due to a mix of slight -- slightly lower Fine Chemistry Services results and slightly higher corporate costs. The FCS business is contract driven and can vary quarter-to-quarter. 
Full year results were very strong compared to history. Comparing the full year to fourth quarter, you can see it and get a sense of the rebound we started to see in the second half of 2020, particularly for lithium and bromine. We are pivoting capital allocation to prioritize high-return growth projects to align with strategic customer demand and maintain our leadership positions. We remain committed to preserving the financial flexibility necessary to fund growth and to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. We'll also continue to support our dividend although dividend growth may be lower than the historical average, while we build out the next wave of growth projects that will enable high return opportunities. Finally, we will pursue a disciplined and thoughtful approach to investments, including M&A and joint ventures. As we've said in the past, the most likely M&A you'd see us do would be bolt-on acquisitions of lithium conversion assets in cases where buying allows us to grow more quickly. And generate better returns than building. We are finalizing the sale of our Fine Chemistry Services and Performance Catalyst Solutions businesses and expect to update you in the coming months.  
Let's turn to Slide 15 for a look at our balance sheet. The primary use of proceeds from our equity offering is to accelerate profitable growth. The 90% -- or about 90% of the proceeds are for lithium growth, with most of the remainder for enhancements to our bromine business. The returns on these projects are highly attractive. And we expect to generate returns at least 2x our weighted average cost of capital at mid-cycle pricing. These are large, long-dated projects with the bulk of incremental spending in 2022 through 2025. In the meantime, instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we plan to delever which will reduce interest expense and cash drag on the balance sheet. This will enable us to use cash and debt capacity to fund investments as they are approved. Our long-term target net leverage ratio remains 2x to 2.5x adjusted EBITDA. Pro forma for the offering, we are below that range but expect to increase our leverage as needed to accelerate growth and deliver returns to shareholders. Overall, we expect 2021 results to improve year-over-year. For the total company, we expect net sales to be higher year-over-year as our businesses continue to recover from the events of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA of between $810 million and $860 million also suggests potential upside compared to 2020 due to higher net sales and ongoing cost savings. We expect CapEx to be slightly higher year-over-year as we begin to execute our accelerated growth projects. However, as I mentioned earlier, the bulk of that spending for these projects will be in 2022 to 2025. Net cash from operations is expected to be lower due to higher cash taxes and higher inventories as we start-up the 2 new lithium plants. Expectations for adjusted diluted EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 is lower than last year due to higher taxes and depreciation as well as the increased share count. Due to the recent severe winter weather, we have temporarily shut down 4 of our U.S. plants. Our Bayport, Pasadena, Magnolia, Baton Rouge plants have been down since Monday. Once it is safe to do so, we will restart these facilities. And this situation is still evolving. At this point, we expect some impact to Q1 results and potentially Q2. And it's possible that weather will have more of an impact than what is currently included in this outlook, and we'll update you if there are any material changes.  
Let's turn to Slide 17. Lithium results are expected to be relatively flat compared to 2020. We expect slightly higher volumes with the restart of North American production late last year, as well as modest efficiency improvements. As usual, we expect volumes to be back half weighted for lithium. At this point, we still anticipate slightly lower pricing depending on full year average realized pricing for carbonate and technical grade products. Our new contract structures provide increased flexibility to increase price in response to improving market prices. Lithium costs will be slightly higher year-over-year related to the start-up cost associated with La Negra and Kemerton, partially offset by continued cost and efficiency improvements. And as Kent discussed, the long-term growth story for lithium is intact. In catalyst, we expect 2021 results to be flat year-over-year, including higher PCS earnings. We expect a decline in North American refining catalyst volume. This is primarily a result of 1 customer who recently indicated that they would deselect Albemarle's catalyst due to our public support for electric vehicles. Longer term, we are continuing to position the catalyst business to grow in emerging markets and capitalize on our strengths as a global specialty chemicals producer in the crude to chemicals market and the renewable fuels market. Raphael can give more color on the challenges and opportunities we see for our catalyst business during Q&A. In bromine, we expect full year 2021 results to improve modestly with continued economic recovery and a return to sold out plants. Our ongoing savings initiatives should offset the impact of inflation.  
Looking ahead, we see steady demand increases for our flagship fire safety products, driven by new technology trends like 5G and electric vehicles.  
I'll turn it back to Kent to review our strategic objectives for 2021."

It's not to say there isn't growth in carbonate for more conventional technologies like LFP, but to enable the growth targets of the western OEMs, in particular, and the range they're looking for energy density, it's going to be hydroxide. And that's true even in 2021. The rate of growth we see for demand in '21 is incrementally higher for hydroxide than it's for carbonate. And as you know, Albemarle is well positioned no matter which way it goes because we have capacity coming on, and we're doubling our capacity in both product lines. As we roll forward and look at Wave III, the predominance of that is going to go towards hydroxide for the reasons I just referenced."

The carbonate delta on carbonating the inversion of carbonate being higher than historically, hydroxide is a $1 or $2 lower. We think that's a dislocation of a rapidly responding China market, which is largely carbonate and not a long time trend. It's important to understand that a lot of the hydroxide market is supplied by low-cost brine producers, of which Albemarle one is on converting to hydroxide, which is what we do at Kings Mountain. And without that supply, there's not enough market, there's enough volume for the marketplace. So the point is that the economics say that there has to be that incentive for those producers to go to hydroxide. So we expect that to revert, and we are obviously very well positioned in both product lines to participate.

The degree to which we give that flexibility also dictates how much of a commitment we make to them as well.

Thanks, Meredith. Good morning, and thanks to you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight our recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy as it relates to accelerating growth and creating a more sustainable business. Scott will give us more detail on our results, outlook and capital allocation. 
This was another strong quarter for Albemarle with solid financial results. We generated net income of $96 million and adjusted EBITDA of $230 million, up 17% from last year. We benefited in part from several lithium customers that accelerated orders under long-term agreements as well as favorable volume and customer mix in our bromine business. 
We continue to see strong market demand for lithium. especially from EVs. First quarter EV sales were up 135% versus last year, led by China. European and North American sales were also up significantly. All that said, remember that we are sold out in bromine and lithium. Therefore, we are maintaining our previously reported company guidance for the full year. Scott will provide additional detail on this in just a few minutes. We are advancing our growth plans with the progress being made at our Wave II lithium projects. These 2 projects, La Negra III and IV and Kemerton I and II, are expected to add volume beginning next year. 
As you are probably aware, during the first quarter, we successfully completed a $1.5 billion equity offering and then subsequently reduced our debt. This enabled us to achieve 2 strategic goals. First, we are now well positioned to execute on our high-return Wave III growth projects for lithium and bromine. And second, we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently upgraded to a BBB rating by S&P Global. I'm also proud to say that we have signed the UN Global Compact, joining the efforts of corporations and stakeholders worldwide to advance sustainability. 
On Slide 5, I want to update you on those 2 projects at La Negra and Kemerton, our 2 ongoing projects to increase lithium production from our world-class resources. These conversion facilities are in the final stages of construction, and when complete, are expected to double our nameplate capacity to 175,000 metric tons per year. This added capacity will provide much needed volumes to support our customers' growth ambitions and will enhance our ability to drive further earnings expansion. Construction is on track for completion later this year. We are watching the Western Australia labor situation closely, but currently, we do not expect any impact to our schedule. Once complete, we move into final commissioning and customer qualification, which typically takes about 6 months. We expect to begin producing commercial volume from both projects in 2022. 
These 2 sites will complete our Wave II lithium projects and enable our team to focus on the execution of Wave III, which represents a further 150,000 metric tons of conversion capacity. We expect to make investment decisions on the first projects from Wave III as early as the middle of this year. This includes a greenfield site in China and potentially the acquisition of a Chinese conversion plant. 
I would like to mention that the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, or CCEN, has confirmed that our resource and reserves report is in full compliance following the additional data we provided in January. We are committed to complying with our regulatory obligations around the world, and we are pleased to reach a satisfactory and collaborative resolution with CCEN. 
Finally, in bromine, we are accelerating our growth projects and expect to see the benefit of these projects beginning in 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Scott to review the first quarter results."

I'll begin on Slide 6, and I'm happy to report on a strong start to the year. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $829 million, a 12% increase from last year.

For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $829 million, a 12% increase from last year. This was driven by increased volumes across our 3 core businesses as well as a favorable customer mix within our bromine unit. 
GAAP net income was $96 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 excludes the cost of early debt repayment that we incurred when we delevered in March following our equity raise. Our sales growth enabled us to generate adjusted EBITDA of $230 million, up 17% from last year, giving us an early start to meeting our guidance for the full year. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. Adjusted EBITDA in total was up $34 million over last year, thanks to stronger lithium and bromine results and a foreign exchange tailwind. Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million versus the prior year as some customers accelerated orders for battery-grade carbonate and hydroxide into the first quarter. To meet this demand, we drew down lower cost inventories resulting in Q1 margin expansion. Average realized pricing was down 10% as expected due to lower carbonate and technical-grade pricing. However, increased volumes more than offset the lower price. Market demand remains very strong, but our plants are sold out, which limits our ability to increase volumes in 2021. 
Bromine's adjusted EBITDA grew by about $8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 9%. The strong quarter was due primarily to higher sales volumes across the product portfolio. Pricing was also higher, in large part related to a favorable customer mix. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm reduced production and increased cost by about $6 million in the quarter. And just like lithium, we drew down inventory in Q1 and our bromine plants are sold out for the year, making it difficult to offset the production losses from the storm. We expect to see the impact from lost production in the Q2 and Q3 time frame. 
Catalysts adjusted EBITDA declined $23 million, primarily due to the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm, which impacted production in Bayport and Pasadena, Texas. These sites incurred increased electric and natural gas costs, production downtime and repair expenses that totaled $26 million. Our Q1 catalyst results from last year included $12 million of income that was later corrected as an out-of-period adjustment, which further complicates the year-over-year comparison for this quarter. Without this and the storm impact, our Catalyst EBITDA would have been up 31%. Our corporate and other category adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower corporate costs. 
Slide 8 highlights the company's financial strength. With the proceeds from our $1.5 billion equity offering in February, we repaid debt. By deleveraging in the short term instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we were able to reduce interest expense and create the debt capacity that will allow us to accelerate our growth for the lithium and bromine businesses, funding investments as they are approved. 
You can see how we are executing on our commitment to grow our dividend and maintain our investment-grade credit rating. We increased our dividend for the 27th consecutive year, which speaks to our ongoing success and a track record of shareholder returns, which we are proud to maintain. 
On Slide 9, we provide a look at our guidance for the year. I would like to note that our company guidance for the year includes a full year of Fine Chemistry Services results. In February, we entered into an agreement to sell the FCS business for proceeds of approximately $570 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. We've also given a breakout of second half guidance for FCS for modeling purposes. 
As we've discussed, our lithium and bromine businesses outperformed expectations for the quarter, primarily driven by accelerated customer orders and a favorable customer mix. We do not expect to see the same upside over the next 3 quarters, mostly because our lithium and bromine businesses are effectively sold out and we don't have excess inventory to meet increased demand. Timing of orders can shift from quarter-to-quarter but the outlook for full year volumes is mostly unchanged, except for modest increases in lithium. 
We continue to monitor the chip shortage at automotive manufacturers for impacts to lithium and bromine. And so far, we've not seen an impact. This may be due to our position in the supply chain. In May, IHS revised their forecast for 2021 EV production down 3% from prior forecasts related to microchip shortages and supply chain issues. EV production is still though expected to be up 70% year-over-year. 
We are maintaining our company guidance for the full year and continue to expect net sales to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion range, which is slightly higher than last year. The demand we saw during the first quarter and sold out volumes speak to the importance of investing in our lithium and bromine businesses to add to our future earnings potential. 
Our 2021 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains between $810 million and $860 million. We continue to expect CapEx to be around $850 million to $950 million for the year as we complete our Wave II lithium projects and begin focusing our efforts on Wave III. Net cash from operations are also tracking on plan. As the year progresses, we expect higher inventories as we start to commission the 2 new lithium plants and higher cash taxes. Expectations for adjusted diluted EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 are on track, reflecting higher taxes, depreciation and increased share count and lower interest expense. 
While our total company guidance has not changed, the outlook for our lithium and catalyst businesses has, as shown on Slide 10. Our outlook for the lithium business has improved due to higher lithium volumes driven by plant productivity improvements, and we have added some tolling of lithium carbonate. We expect lithium prices to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year due to tightening market conditions. Overall, average realized pricing for the year will be flat compared to last year. We continue to expect higher costs in 2021 related to project startups, but this will be partially offset by efficiency improvements. In total, lithium EBITDA is now expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis. 
The outlook for our catalyst business is lower than we had originally planned. offsetting the upside we expect from lithium. On a year-over-year basis, total Catalyst results were projected to be down about 30% to 40%. This is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm and delays in customer FCC units. 
Our outlook for the bromine business has not changed. While we had a very strong first quarter, we do not expect the favorable customer mix to continue in future quarters and we will not be able to make up the lost production in the first quarter. In addition, raw material costs are moving higher. We continue to expect results to be modestly higher than last year due to continued economic recovery and improvements in certain end markets, including electronics and building and construction, along with ongoing cost savings and improved pricing. 
Finally, as to our quarterly progression for the full company, we expect Q2 to have modest growth in EBITDA and the second half to have a modest decline. We continue to expect that 2022 results will benefit from accelerated growth plans in bromine, recovery in Catalysts and the initial lithium sales from La Negra III and IV and Kemerton I and II. And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent."

In addition to supporting the UNGC principles, we are aligning our sustainability framework to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world. 
Over the past year, we've increased ESG disclosure, published updated sustainability policies and made public commitments to advance sustainability. Sustainability is, by its nature, a long-term commitment. But I'm pleased to report that we are beginning to see the benefits of our efforts. For example, Albemarle was recently recognized and added to the S&P 500 ESG Index. You can expect more details on these and other sustainability-related initiatives in our 2020 Annual Sustainability Report due to be issued in June. 
Now on Slide 12, I'd like to reiterate our corporate strategy. We have started 2021 with a strong quarter and continue to make progress on our 4 strategic pillars. We are completing our Wave II projects and plan for those to deliver commercial volumes and generate sales in 2022. We are making plans to execute on our Wave III lithium projects as well as expand our bromine resources to align with growing customer demand. And we are laser-focused on operational discipline to drive maximum productivity across our businesses. We continue to expect around $75 million of productivity improvements this year, and we will continuously work to improve efficiencies within our operations. With a revitalized balance sheet, we are well positioned to invest in high-return growth, maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. 
Finally, sustainability remains a top priority and key component of our value proposition to our customers, and we are dedicated to exploring opportunities such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals to help us implement these efforts. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions, and we'll hand over to Olivia."

As we bring that capacity on, that's where the volume will go. So that 60% of sales will grow larger on a volume basis. 
Now in terms of pricing, that's an evolution that we're going through now in our contracts. We've had, as you may know, concessions we made to fixed-price contracts we've done in the past. And while that's given us security of supply to run our plants and strong margins at the bottom of the cycle, we're now evolving those pricing mechanisms to give us more exposure to the market as it recovers. And that will benefit this volume as well. We bring on volume under new terms that will allow us to benefit from a rising market."

I think the short answer to your question is while mines are restarting, there are still some that went into the bankruptcy phase in Australia that still haven't come back. They are -- there it takes some time, particularly in Western Australia right now given the labor crisis and the rising iron ore prices to mobilize both equipment and labor personnel to restart a plant. So what we foresee going forward, given the strong demand that's starting to develop -- has been under development in China and is now ramping around the world, that it's going to remain short in China. That spodumene is going to be a constraint. That is why you're seeing carbonate prices rise so quickly in China, where there is a high demand, in particular, for carbonate for some of the recovering industries in China post pandemic, but also because of the growth of LFP chemistry, specifically in China. And inventories are a bare minimum in the Chinese market and have come back to normal levels worldwide, which is why we were in a position during the first quarter to otherwise thought like as in prior quarters would not be a strong quarter. We are -- it was quite the opposite. We had to pull volumes forward into that to drive the growth that you saw.

The bridging strategy, in this case, is to get us revamped in relationships with Chinese customers that we've supplied in the past such that when we bring on La Negra III and IV next year, we have a ready customer base to take that on. So I would think of it as ad hoc or bridging. It's not a sustained strategy. It is something -- we're not -- I can't get into the details of volumes per se. But it is to, as you point out, not as lucrative, not as high a margin of business for us because we're paying somebody to convert for us.

I think we're already starting to see an improvement in refining utilization, and you'll see that throughout the year and into next year, that's going to have -- will have a big effect on FCC usage at the refineries. And our business, about 60% of our business is FCC, so we'll see that recovery. 
On the CFT or HPC business, that business is timed with turnarounds at refineries. A lot of that's been pushed out until 2022, and that's when we'll start to see an uptick in that business. The portfolio we have in our business is very much geared towards high performance. When refiners are running near capacity, that's really when the value of our business -- of our products kicks in because we help them maximize on yield, maximize on the throughput through their assets.

And it's the basis for any new contracts we've struck. We've struck several new contracts, both with battery and automotive OEM producers in the past 3 to 6 months. And they are in that same construct. Now it's important to note, it's not one structure. We have some customers who actually value more consistency. And obviously, that's a higher price point from a fixed price standpoint, so we can get our returns over the cycle. And there are certain commitments we'll make to go along with them on volume. On the other hand, those who are more fixated on price, we'll have a component of our mix there.

Good morning, and thanks to you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight our recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy as it relates to accelerating growth and creating a more sustainable business. Scott wi",609,"Okay. Thanks, Meredith. Good morning, and thanks to you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will highlight our recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy as it relates to accelerating growth and creating a more sustainable business. Scott will give us more detail on our results, outlook and capital allocation. 
This was another strong quarter for Albemarle with solid financial results. We generated net income of $96 million and adjusted EBITDA of $230 million, up 17% from last year. We benefited in part from several lithium customers that accelerated orders under long-term agreements as well as favorable volume and customer mix in our Bromine business.  
We continue to see strong market demand for lithium, especially from EVs. First quarter EV sales were up 135% versus last year, led by China. European and North American sales were also up significantly. All that said, remember that we are sold out in bromine and lithium. Therefore, we are maintaining our previously reported company guidance for the full year. Scott will provide additional detail on this in just a few minutes. We are advancing our growth plans with the progress being made at our Wave II lithium projects. These 2 projects, La Negra III and IV and Kemerton I and II are expected to add volume beginning next year.
As you are probably aware, during the first quarter, we successfully completed a $1.5 billion equity offering and then subsequently reduced our debt. This enabled us to achieve 2 strategic goals. First, we are now well positioned to execute on our high-return Wave III growth projects for lithium and bromine. And second, we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently upgraded to a BBB rating by S&P Global. I'm also proud to say that we have signed the U.N. Global Compact, joining the efforts of corporations and stakeholders worldwide to advance sustainability.
On Slide 5, I want to update you on those 2 projects at La Negra and Kemerton, our 2 ongoing projects to increase lithium production from our world-class resources. These conversion facilities are in the final stages of construction and when complete, are expected to double our nameplate capacity to 175,000 metric tons per year. This added capacity will provide much needed volumes to support our customers' growth ambitions and will enhance our ability to drive further earnings expansion. Construction is on track for completion later this year. We are watching the Western Australia labor situation closely, but currently, we do not expect any impact to our schedule. Once complete, we move into final commissioning and customer qualification, which typically takes about 6 months. We expect to begin producing commercial volume from both projects in 2022.
These 2 sites will complete our Wave II lithium projects and enable our team to focus on the execution of Wave III, which represents a further 150,000 metric tons of conversion capacity. We expect to make investment decisions on the first projects from Wave III as early as the middle of this year. This includes a greenfield site in China and potentially the acquisition of a Chinese conversion plant.
I would like to mention that the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, or CCHEN, has confirmed that our resource and reserves report is in full compliance following the additional data we provided in January. We are committed to complying with our regulatory obligations around the world, and we are pleased to reach a satisfactory and collaborative resolution with CCHEN. Finally, in bromine, we are accelerating our growth projects and expect to see the benefit of these projects beginning in 2022. 
I'll now turn the call over to Scott to review the first quarter results."

I'll begin on Slide 6, and I'm happy to report on a strong start to the year. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $829 million, a 12% increase from last year. This was driven by increased volumes across our 3 core businesses as",1292,"Thanks, Kent. I'll begin on Slide 6, and I'm happy to report on a strong start to the year. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $829 million, a 12% increase from last year. This was driven by increased volumes across our 3 core businesses as well as a favorable customer mix within our bromine unit.  
GAAP net income was $96 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 excludes the cost of early debt repayment that we incurred when we delevered in March following our equity raise. Our sales growth enabled us to generate adjusted EBITDA of $230 million, up 17% from last year, giving us an early start to meeting our guidance for the full year.  
Now turning to Slide 7 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. Adjusted EBITDA in total was up $34 million over last year, thanks to stronger lithium and bromine results and a foreign exchange tailwind. Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million versus the prior year as some customers accelerated orders for battery-grade carbonate and hydroxide into the first quarter. To meet this demand, we drew down lower cost inventories resulting in Q1 margin expansion. Average realized pricing was down 10% as expected due to lower carbonate and technical-grade pricing. However, increased volumes more than offset the lower price. Market demand remains very strong, but our plants are sold out, which limits our ability to increase volumes in 2021.
Bromine's adjusted EBITDA grew by about $8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 9%. The strong quarter was due primarily to higher sales volumes across the product portfolio. Pricing was also higher, in large part related to a favorable customer mix. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm reduced production and increased cost by about $6 million in the quarter. And just like lithium, we drew down inventory in Q1 and our bromine plants are sold out for the year, making it difficult to offset the production losses from the storm. We expect to see the impact from lost production in the Q2 and Q3 time frame.
Catalysts' adjusted EBITDA declined $23 million, primarily due to the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm, which impacted production in Bayport and Pasadena, Texas. These sites incurred increased electric and natural gas costs, production downtime and repair expenses that totaled $26 million. Our Q1 catalyst results from last year included $12 million of income that was later corrected as an out-of-period adjustment, which further complicates the year-over-year comparison for this quarter. Without this and the storm impact, our Catalysts EBITDA would have been up 31%.  
Our corporate and other category adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower corporate costs.
Slide 8 highlights the company's financial strength. With the proceeds from our $1.5 billion equity offering in February, we repaid debt. By deleveraging in the short term, instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we were able to reduce interest expense and create the debt capacity that will allow us to accelerate our growth for the lithium and bromine businesses, funding investments as they are approved. You can see how we are executing on our commitment to grow our dividend and maintain our investment-grade credit rating. We increased our dividend for the 27th consecutive year, which speaks to our ongoing success and a track record of shareholder returns, which we are proud to maintain.
On Slide 9, we provide a look at our guidance for the year. I would like to note that our company guidance for the year includes a full year of Fine Chemistry Services results. In February, we entered into an agreement to sell the FCS business for proceeds of approximately $570 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. We've also given a breakout of second half guidance for FCS for modeling purposes.
As we've discussed, our lithium and bromine businesses outperformed expectations for the quarter, primarily driven by accelerated customer orders and a favorable customer mix. We do not expect to see the same upside over the next 3 quarters, mostly because our lithium and bromine businesses are effectively sold out and we don't have excess inventory to meet increased demand. Timing of orders can shift from quarter-to-quarter but the outlook for full year volumes is mostly unchanged, except for modest increases in lithium.
We continue to monitor the chip shortage at automotive manufacturers for impacts to lithium and bromine. And so far, we've not seen an impact. This may be due to our position in the supply chain. In May, IHS revised their forecast for 2021 EV production, down 3% from prior forecasts related to microchip shortages and supply chain issues. EV production is still though expected to be up 70% year-over-year.
We are maintaining our company guidance for the full year and continue to expect net sales to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion range, which is slightly higher than last year. The demand we saw during the first quarter and sold out volumes speak to the importance of investing in our lithium and bromine businesses to add to our future earnings potential.
Our 2021 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains between $810 million and $860 million. We continue to expect CapEx to be around $850 million to $950 million for the year as we complete our Wave II lithium projects and begin focusing our efforts on Wave III. Net cash from operations are also tracking on plan. As the year progresses, we expect higher inventories as we start to commission the 2 new lithium plants, and higher cash taxes. Expectations for adjusted diluted EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 are on track, reflecting higher taxes, depreciation and increased share count and lower interest expense.
While our total company guidance has not changed, the outlook for our lithium and catalyst businesses has, as shown on Slide 10. Our outlook for the lithium business has improved due to higher lithium volumes driven by plant productivity improvements, and we have added some tolling of lithium carbonate. We expect lithium prices to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year due to tightening market conditions. Overall, average realized pricing for the year will be flat compared to last year. We continue to expect higher costs in 2021 related to project startups, but this will be partially offset by efficiency improvements. In total, Lithium EBITDA is now expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis. 
The outlook for our catalyst business is lower than we had originally planned, offsetting the upside we expect from lithium. On a year-over-year basis, total catalyst results are projected to be down about 30% to 40%. This is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm and delays in customer FCC units.
Our outlook for the bromine business has not changed. While we had a very strong first quarter, we do not expect the favorable customer mix to continue in future quarters and we will not be able to make up the lost production in the first quarter. In addition, raw material costs are moving higher. We continue to expect results to be modestly higher than last year due to continued economic recovery and improvements in certain end markets, including electronics and building and construction, along with ongoing cost savings and improved pricing.
Finally, as to our quarterly progression for the full company, we expect Q2 to have modest growth in EBITDA and the second half to have a modest decline. We continue to expect that 2022 results will benefit from accelerated growth plans in bromine, recovery in catalyst and the initial lithium sales from La Negra III and IV and Kemerton I and II.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent."

In addition to supporting the UNGC principles, we are aligning our sustainability framework to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world.
Over the past year, we've increased ESG disclosure, published updated sustainability policies and made public commitments to advance sustainability. Sustainability is, by its nature, a long-term commitment. But I'm pleased to report that we are beginning to see the benefits of our efforts. For example, Albemarle was recently recognized and added to the S&P 500 ESG Index. You can expect more details on these and other sustainability-related initiatives in our 2020 Annual Sustainability report due to be issued in June.
Now on Slide 12, I'd like to reiterate our corporate strategy. We have started 2021 with a strong quarter and continue to make progress on our 4 strategic pillars. We are completing our Wave II projects and plan for those to deliver commercial volumes and generate sales in 2022. We are making plans to execute on our Wave III lithium projects as well as expand our bromine resources to align with growing customer demand. And we are laser-focused on operational discipline to drive maximum productivity across our businesses. We continue to expect around $75 million of productivity improvements this year, and we will continuously work to improve efficiencies within our operations.
With a revitalized balance sheet, we are well positioned to invest in high-return growth maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. Finally, sustainability remains a top priority and key component of our value proposition to our customers, and we are dedicated to exploring opportunities such as the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals to help us implement these efforts.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions, and we'll hand over to Olivia."

So that's where our growth is. As we bring that capacity on, that's where the volume will go. So that 60% of sales will grow larger on a volume basis. 
Now in terms of pricing, that's an evolution that we're going through now in our contracts. We've had, as you may know, concessions we made to fixed-price contracts we've done in the past. And while that's given us security of supply to run our plants and strong margins at the bottom of the cycle, we're now evolving those pricing mechanisms to give us more exposure to the market as it recovers. And that will benefit this volume as well. We bring on volume under new terms that will allow us to benefit from a rising market."

I think the short answer to your question is while mines are restarting, there are still some that went into the bankruptcy phase in Australia that still haven't come back. They are -- it takes some time, particularly in Western Australia right now given the labor crisis and the rising iron ore prices, to mobilize both equipment and labor personnel to restart a plant. So what we foresee going forward, given the strong demand that's starting to develop -- or has been under development in China and is now ramping around the world, that it's going to remain short in China. That spodumene is going to be a constraint. That is why you're seeing carbonate prices rise so quickly in China, where there is a high demand, in particular for carbonate for some of the recovering industries in China postpandemic, but also because of the growth of LFP chemistry, specifically in China.
And inventories are a bare minimum in the Chinese market and have come back to normal levels worldwide, which is why we were in a position during the first quarter to otherwise thought, like as in prior quarters, would not be a strong quarter, where it was quite the opposite. We had to pull volumes forward into that to drive the growth that you saw.

So I would think of it as ad hoc or bridging. It's not a sustained strategy. It is something -- we're not -- I can't get into the details of volumes per se. But it is to, as you point out, not as lucrative, not as high a margin of business for us because we're paying somebody to convert for us.

So we've been talking about kind of the shift in our commercial strategy in lithium for some time. We kind of delayed -- intentionally delayed the conversion from kind of a strict long-term fixed-price contract to one that is more indicative of the market, that moves more with the market. And we'd have different types of customers we'd contract slightly different ways. We delayed the conversion of that a little bit because the market was so far down. We didn't think it was the right time to negotiate at the bottom of the market, so we held off on that. So that strategy hasn't changed and the new volume doesn't change that.
So I think we're moving into that dynamic as we go through the next 12 months or that the contracts we'll be negotiating will be on that new basis. So portfolio of customers with -- kind of customers who really want security of supply will be more of a fixed price, but it will still move with the markets and then contract with other people that look more like market prices. Not spot prices contracted, but prices that move with the market. And that's what we've been talking about for the, I would say, almost the last year. And we did delay the implementation intentionally because we felt like we didn't want to negotiate at the bottom of the market."

And during the crisis of the past year plus, we've -- we gave some relief on that. That relief clause expires during the course of this year. Some in the middle of this year, all by the end of the year. So that's -- for our legacy contracts, that's the time frame we'll be looking to move to the new structure that we'd earlier described and that will give us that upside to rise -- have price rise with the market more freely than it would have under the fixed-price constructs. And it's the basis for any new contracts we've struck. We've struck several new contracts, both with battery and automotive OEM producers in the past 3 to 6 months. And they are in that same construct. 
Now it's important to note, it's not one structure. We have some customers who actually value more consistency. And obviously, that's a higher price point from a fixed price standpoint, so we can get our returns over the cycle. And there are certain commitments we'll make to go along with them on volume. On the other hand, those who are more fixated on price, we'll have a component of our mix there. We will be a little more -- just exercise more discretion about how long we go on some of those contracts. And so there's going to be a mix there, there's going to be mix that we see.

I'll also introduce the new operating model we are implementing to support Albemarle's growth strategy. Scott will give you more detail on our results, outlook and guidance. 
Our businesses continue to execute well as global markets improve. Second quarter net sales were $774 million and adjusted EBITDA was $195 million, both of which marked a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. Note that we closed the divestiture of FCS on June 1. So second quarter 2021 included only 2 months of FCS results. Excluding FCS, net sales increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up 13% compared to last year. And our financial release issued yesterday after the close, we revised our guidance for the year, in part to reflect higher lithium performance, but also supply chain disruptions for our bromine business. We've also updated full year guidance to reflect the sale of FCS. Scott will walk you through those changes in more detail in just a few minutes. 
We continue to execute on our next wave of growth projects to capitalize on attractive long-term fundamentals in the markets we serve. We recently completed construction of La Negra 3 and 4 as planned, and we are progressing through the commissioning stage. Finally, I want to briefly describe the operating model we are launching to drive greater value, improve performance and deliver exceptional customer service. And you see that on Slide 5.  
Our operating model, which we call the Albemarle Way of Excellence, or AWE, serves as a framework for how we execute, deliver and ultimately accelerate our strategy. AWE is based on 4 pillars: sustainable approach includes responsibly managing our natural resourcing and engaging with our stakeholders; high-performance culture includes focusing on safety leadership and fostering an agile, engaged corporate culture; competitive capabilities means we are ensuring we have the right talent, resources and technologies; and finally, operational discipline is about embracing lean principles and operational excellence across the organization. 
The operating model helps us connect our strategy with day-to-day initiatives, prioritize projects, clarify resource allocation, ensure accountability and drive efficient and profitable execution. We will discuss the operating model in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day on September 10. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We've completed construction of La Negra 3 and 4 in Chile and are in the commissioning stage. We expect commercial production from these 2 trains beginning in the first half of next year, ramping to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year by 2024. This brownfield project allows us to increase existing capacity and leverage our world-class brine resource in Chile, just one of the avenues of growth that we have as an established lithium producer with a global footprint. 
We also continue to progress our Kemerton conversion facility in Western Australia. To mitigate risk related to the tight labor market and COVID-related travel restrictions in Western Australia, we have modified our execution strategy to prioritize Kemerton I over Kemerton II. Kemerton I remains on track for construction completion by the end of the year. We now anticipate completion of Kemerton II by the end of the first quarter next year, a delay of about 3 months. These delays and higher labor rates have also increased capital cost. It's been a difficult situation in a labor market that was already tight, but we have been able to maintain the schedule for Kemerton I with only a 3-month delay for Kemerton II. We continue to expect commercial production for both Kemerton I and II during 2022. 
Importantly, we are making progress on our Wave 3 lithium projects, and we'll provide further details at Investor Day in September. Site selection is underway, and we are negotiating with the authorities to include investment agreements. We're also expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. We completed the first well at Magnolia ahead of schedule and under budget. Unfortunately, we're unable to take advantage of that additional capacity in the second half due to shortages of chlorine in the supply chain. We also have 2 projects in Arkansas that are currently in the select phase. These projects are designed to increase production capacity of clear brine fluids and hydrobromic acid. A third project to increase the capacity of our brominated flame retardants is in the evaluate stage. 
I'll hand the call over to Scott, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter."
18671,718658983,2364545,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7. We generated net sales of $774 million during the second quarter, which is a slight increase from the same period last year, driven by stronger sales from our lithium and bromine segments. H",935,"Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7. We generated net sales of $774 million during the second quarter, which is a slight increase from the same period last year, driven by stronger sales from our lithium and bromine segments. Higher sales as well as strong operating margins resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $195 million, which was 5% higher year-over-year. GAAP net income of $425 million includes an after-tax gain of $332 million related to the divestiture of our FCS business to W.R. Grace. Adjusted EPS, which excludes the gain on FCS, was $0.89 for the quarter, up 4% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. Excluding FCS, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% or $22 million compared to the prior year. Higher adjusted EBITDA for lithium and bromine was partially offset by higher corporate costs related to incentive compensation and foreign exchange movements. Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased by $19 million, excluding FX compared to last year, primarily driven by higher volumes, customers under long-term agreements continue to pull orders forward and we shipped higher spodumene volumes from our Talison joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA for bromine increased by $16 million due to higher volumes and pricing. End market demand continues to very strong following the winter storms experienced in Q1 with very limited excess capacity or inventory to meet that additional demand. Catalyst adjusted EBITDA declined just $1 million from the previous year. CFT volumes were down due to shipment timing, SEC continued to be impacted by a change in the order patterns from a large North American customer, although the FCC demand trend was generally higher. This was partially offset by excellent TS results which benefited from a favorable customer mix. 
Slide 9 highlights the company's financial strength. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet. The strategic decision to divest our FCS business added cash proceeds to the balance sheet and reduced our leverage ratio to 1.5x. That transaction further demonstrates our ability to drive value by prudently managing our asset portfolio. Our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating gives us the financial flexibility we need to accelerate profitable growth and continue to provide a growing dividend. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that Kent mentioned earlier. And there are several key changes from our previous guidance. First, higher net sales guidance reflects higher lithium sales volumes and improving catalyst trends, offset by a lower bromine outlook. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is the same reflecting higher net sales, offset by higher corporate costs and foreign exchange expense. Guidance on adjusted diluted EPS and net cash from operations is improving from an expected reduction in interest expense and tax rates. The timing of working capital changes is also expected to benefit net cash from operations. And finally, we see capital expenditures trending towards the high end of our previous $850 million to $950 million range based on the tight labor markets in Western Australia, as Kent discussed. 
In the far right column, pro forma revised guidance ranges are adjusted for the sale of our FCS business on June 1 this year, removing the guidance on FCS for the rest of the year. 
I'm turning to Slide 11 for more detail on the GBUs outlook. Adjusted EBITDA for lithium is expected to increase by 10% to 15% over last year, an improvement from our previous outlook. Lithium volume growth is expected to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, mostly due to higher tolling volumes as well as the restart of North American plants at the beginning of the year and improvements in plant productivity. Our pricing outlook is unchanged. We continue to expect average realized pricing to increase sequentially over the second half of the year, but to remain roughly flat compared to full year 2020. 
We also continue to expect margins to remain below 35%, owing to higher costs related to project start-ups and incremental tolling costs. Margins should improve as the plants ramp up commercial sales volumes. 
Our outlook for Catalyst hasn't changed since the first quarter report with adjusted EBITDA anticipated to be lower by 30% to 40%. However, we are more optimistic as fuel markets continue to improve globally. Lower year-over-year results are primarily related to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast, winter storm in the first quarter and the ongoing impact from the change in customer order patterns in North America. 
Finally, for bromine, we now expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, which is down from our previous outlook due to a force majeure declaration from our chlorine supplier in the U.S. Like many industrial companies, we are -- increased costs and supply disruptions for raw materials, but it is partially offset by price and productivity improvements. Results are expected to be lower in the second half as production is constrained due to the chlorine shortage. We are accelerating our expansion plans in bromine. However, we have been unable to take advantage of this new capacity yet due to the chlorine disruption. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect sales and EBITDA increases for all 3 businesses. Lithium results are expected to improve on the higher volumes as the new plants ramp up. Bromine results are expected to rebound from short-term supply chain disruptions and the winter storm impacts, and Catalyst results are expected to rebound strongly from 2021 levels, assuming continued improvements in global transportation fuel demand. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent."

As previously discussed, we are making progress on our Wave 3 lithium projects and expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. 
Second, we are increasing productivity. We are on track to achieve at least our targeted $75 million in productivity improvements this year. We expect to continue to build on these improvements as we implement our operating model and build a culture of continuous improvement. 
Third, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to investments and continue to optimize shareholder value by actively managing our portfolio of assets, including the recently completed FCS divestiture.

So you kind of have a meeting of mines there. But we're also in parallel, we're progressing our plans to do greenfield projects as well. And if we were able to find an acquisition, we continue to progress the Greenwood plans that we have. So they would be -- they're not -- if we did an acquisition, that doesn't mean we stop our greenfield plans and projects, but we would just do them in parallel. And then the last part -- I'm sorry, a lot about the U.S. So I mean, we will look at the U.S., but it's not in the next year or so, right? So it's -- there's time.

The China market is very dependent for its growth on imported spodumene. So -- and there is a shortfall of available supply to meet demand given the rapid growth post pandemic, particularly in carbonate in China. So in that regard, maybe spodumene is a bit of a lead because it's the short supply. But I think what we expect to happen is more supply to come into China from other parts of the world. We've seen prices go up and stay up with demand. It's hard to say what's going to happen with spodumene prices. From an Albemarle perspective, the way we take advantage of that is we don't sell spodumene or that's right, we don't sell chemical grade spodumene to say we sell a specialty spodumene for the glass market. But for us, it's tolling. So you've heard us talk about looking at tolling opportunities, and that's part of our improved guidance.

So the Kemerton plant with a start-up in the early part of next year, there is a 3-month delay to the second unit. We've talked about getting to full run rate capacity by the end of the second year in that facility. Similarly, in carbonate, you'd see a phenomenon that is somewhat like that. I would say our run rate for carbonate by the end of '22 will probably be at the 30,000 run rate basis at the end of the year, that ramps. It's a little bit different, ramping brine versus spodumene because Brian is obviously a harvested material versus a fixed input. But that roughly should -- between those 2 should be able to calculate sort of our guidance. The change would be a slight delay at Kemerton. And then a year-on-year growth that we can achieve in tolling.

What we're limited on is our ability to get conversion capacity in the ground quickly. So -- and that's part of our plan for next year. As to the long term, my guess would be that our view would be, I should say, that hydroxide will probably see the higher rate of growth going forward off a smaller base. Carbonate has done well in the near term based upon the LFP trend for lower-end vehicles, particularly in China, and we see that starting to take root in some other regions as well for the low end. But the key to high EV penetration is higher energy density. And the key to that is hydroxide and ultimately, potentially solid-state chemistries.

On recycling, recycling is happening around the world. And so the companies you're referring to are largely here in the U.S. There's a set of companies similarly in Europe. -- a regional business model because of the collection and nature of different regulations around the world. As a global player, we're engaged with all of these companies. We view them in almost every case as a partner, not a competitor. And we bring process technology and know-how that -- what we deploy in some of our existing Virginia operations that could be a partnership approach to helping to remove the lithium and/or take a byproduct that comes out of their operations, which is lithium rich. So that's the way we work with them. You have to remember, a lot of these companies got set up, and this is -- and then Europe is ahead on this, largely to go after the nickel and the cobalt not lithium. Lithium is usually the byproduct of the recycling operation, that's where we fit in. And so as we look at trying to partner with our customers and drive their success from a sustainability standpoint, we view this as an important part of the value mix we bring is helping them recycle the lithium and recycle it back to them for their continued growth. 
On the Tesla side, we view what Tesla has described as very -- generally very consistent with our market outlook. It's going to continue to shift, and I think, expand, meaning the size of the EV market, which by 2025 might be at one level, but by 2030, I think you're going to have a larger proportion of vehicles that are electrified. -- some news out about some intentions around that here in the U.S. today. And for the lower end, LFP is the applicable technology. I mean it gives you a lower range. We still believe, though, that for the mid and the higher range vehicles, you're going to need -- in order to get -- you need higher energy density to get the range. And you can drive good cost if you can get good technology and then get the cost per kilowatt hour down, you don't get the kilowatt hours up per unit weight. So that's the mix we see.

And -- so I surmise, most of that is coming from more volumes from via green bushes and that spodumene being converted downstream via tollers. First, is that an accurate characterization? And then with that in mind, Eric, I'm pretty sure you've stated in the past that you don't rely on toll conversion for battery-grade chemicals, but only for technical grade lithium products. But in this case, it seems like the extra volumes are carbonate feeding into the LFP cathode market. So just wondering if that also is accurate? And if that's the case, should we be thinking of these carbonate grades via tollers as just -- or maybe just the LFP market being more of a technical grade market?

I'll also introduce the new operating model we are implementing to support Albemarle's growth strategy. Scott will give you more detail on our results, outlook and guidance. 
Our businesses continue to execute well as global markets improve. Second quarter net sales were $774 million and adjusted EBITDA was $195 million, both of which marked a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. Note that we closed the divestiture of FCS on June 1. So second quarter 2021 included only 2 months of FCS results. 
Excluding FCS, net sales increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up 13% compared to last year. And our financial release issued yesterday after the close, we revised our guidance for the year, in part to reflect higher lithium performance, but also supply chain disruptions for our bromine business. We've also updated full year guidance to reflect the sale of FCS. Scott will walk you through those changes in more detail in just a few minutes. 
We continue to execute on our next wave of growth projects to capitalize on attractive long-term fundamentals in the markets we serve. We recently completed construction of La Negra 3 and 4 as planned, and we are progressing through the commissioning stage. Finally, I want to briefly describe the operating model we are launching to drive greater value, improve performance and deliver exceptional customer service. And you see that on Slide 5.  
Our operating model, which we call the Albemarle Way of Excellence, or AWE, serves as a framework for how we execute, deliver and ultimately accelerate our strategy. AWE is based on 4 pillars: sustainable approach includes responsibly managing our natural resourcing and engaging with our stakeholders; high-performance culture includes focusing on safety leadership and fostering an agile, engaged corporate culture; competitive capabilities means we are ensuring we have the right talent, resources and technologies; and finally, operational discipline is about embracing lean principles and operational excellence across the organization. 
The operating model helps us connect our strategy with day-to-day initiatives, prioritize projects, clarify resource allocation, ensure accountability and drive efficient and profitable execution. We will discuss the operating model in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day on September 10. 
Now turning to Slide 6. We've completed construction of La Negra 3 and 4 in Chile and are in the commissioning stage. We expect commercial production from these 2 trains beginning in the first half of next year, ramping to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year by 2024. This brownfield project allows us to increase existing capacity and leverage our world-class brine resource in Chile, just one of the avenues of growth that we have as an established lithium producer with a global footprint. 
We also continue to progress our Kemerton conversion facility in Western Australia. To mitigate risk related to the tight labor market and COVID-related travel restrictions in Western Australia, we have modified our execution strategy to prioritize Kemerton I over Kemerton II. Kemerton I remains on track for construction completion by the end of the year. 
We now anticipate completion of Kemerton II by the end of the first quarter next year, a delay of about 3 months. These delays and higher labor rates have also increased capital cost. It's been a difficult situation in a labor market that was already tight, but we have been able to maintain the schedule for Kemerton I with only a 3-month delay for Kemerton II. We continue to expect commercial production for both Kemerton I and II during 2022. 
Importantly, we are making progress on our Wave III lithium projects, and we'll provide further details at Investor Day in September. Site selection is underway, and we are negotiating with the authorities to include investment agreements. We're also expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. We completed the first well at Magnolia ahead of schedule and under budget. 
Unfortunately, we're unable to take advantage of that additional capacity in the second half due to shortages of chlorine in the supply chain. We also have 2 projects in Arkansas that are currently in the select phase. These projects are designed to increase production capacity of clear brine fluids and hydrobromic acid. A third project to increase the capacity of our brominated flame retardants is in the evaluate stage. 
I'll now hand the call over to Scott, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter."
18671,718658983,2365178,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7. We generated net sales of $774 million during the second quarter, which is a slight increase from the same period last year, driven by stronger sales from our lithium and bromine segments. H",936,"Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7. We generated net sales of $774 million during the second quarter, which is a slight increase from the same period last year, driven by stronger sales from our lithium and bromine segments. Higher sales as well as strong operating margins resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $195 million, which was 5% higher year-over-year. GAAP net income of $425 million includes an after-tax gain of $332 million related to the divestiture of our FCS business to W.R. Grace. Adjusted EPS, which excludes the gain on FCS, was $0.89 for the quarter, up 4% from the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. Excluding FCS, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% or $22 million compared to the prior year. Higher adjusted EBITDA for lithium and bromine was partially offset by higher corporate costs related to incentive compensation and foreign exchange movements. 
Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased by $19 million, excluding FX compared to last year, primarily driven by higher volumes, as customers under long-term agreements continue to pull orders forward and we shipped higher spodumene volumes from our Talison joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA for bromine increased by $16 million due to higher volumes and pricing. 
End market demand continues to very strong following the winter storms experienced in Q1 we had very limited excess capacity or inventory to meet that additional demand. Catalyst adjusted EBITDA declined just $1 million from the previous year. CFT volumes were down due to shipment timing, FCC continued to be impacted by a change in their order patterns from a large North American customer, although the FCC demand trend was generally higher. 
This was partially offset by excellent PCS results which benefited from a favorable customer mix. Slide 9 highlights the company's financial strength. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet. The strategic decision to divest our FCS business added cash proceeds to the balance sheet and reduced our leverage ratio to 1.5x. That transaction further demonstrates our ability to drive value by prudently managing our asset portfolio. 
Our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating gives us the financial flexibility we need to accelerate profitable growth and continue to provide a growing dividend. Turning to Slide 10. I'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that Kent mentioned earlier. And there are several key changes from our previous guidance. First, higher net sales guidance reflects higher lithium sales volumes and improving catalyst trends, offset by a lower bromine outlook. 
Adjusted EBITDA guidance is the same reflecting higher net sales, offset by higher corporate costs and foreign exchange expense. Guidance on adjusted diluted EPS and net cash from operations is improving from an expected reduction in interest expense and tax rates. The timing of working capital changes is also expected to benefit net cash from operations. And finally, we see capital expenditures trending towards the high end of our previous $850 million to $950 million range based on the tight labor markets in Western Australia, as Kent discussed. 
In the far-right column, pro forma revised guidance ranges are adjusted for the sale of our FCS business on June 1 this year, removing the guidance on FCS for the rest of the year. I'm turning to Slide 11 for more detail on the GBUs outlook. Adjusted EBITDA for lithium is expected to increase by 10% to 15% over last year, an improvement from our previous outlook. Lithium volume growth is expected to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, mostly due to higher tolling volumes as well as the restart of North American plants at the beginning of the year and improvements in plant productivity. 
Our pricing outlook is unchanged. We continue to expect average realized pricing to increase sequentially over the second half of the year, but to remain roughly flat compared to full year 2020. We also continue to expect margins to remain below 35%, owing to higher costs related to project start-ups and incremental tolling costs. Margins should improve as the plants ramp up commercial sales volumes. 
Our outlook for Catalyst hasn't changed since the first quarter report with adjusted EBITDA anticipated to be lower by 30% to 40%. However, we are more optimistic as fuel markets continue to improve globally. Lower year-over-year results are primarily related to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast, winter storm in the first quarter and the ongoing impact from the change in customer order patterns in North America. 
Finally, for bromine, we now expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, which is down from our previous outlook due to a force majeure declaration from our chlorine supplier in the U.S. Like many industrial companies, we are -- increased costs and supply disruptions for raw materials, but it is partially offset by price and productivity improvements. 
Results are expected to be lower in the second half as production is constrained due to the chlorine shortage. We are accelerating our expansion plans in bromine. However, we have been unable to take advantage of this new capacity yet due to the chlorine disruption. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect sales and EBITDA increases for all 3 businesses. 
Lithium results are expected to improve on the higher volumes as the new plants ramp up.

On Slide 12, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives for 2021. First, we are growing profitably. Construction is complete at La Negra, and we are commissioning this project with commercial volumes expected in the first half of next year. Both Kemerton trains are expected to contribute volumes in 2022 as well, despite the restructuring of our execution plan at Kemerton. As previously discussed, we are making progress on our Wave 3 lithium projects and expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. 
Second, we are increasing productivity. We are on track to achieve at least our targeted $75 million in productivity improvements this year. We expect to continue to build on these improvements as we implement our operating model and build a culture of continuous improvement. 
Third, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to investments and continue to optimize shareholder value by actively managing our portfolio of assets, including the recently completed FCS divestiture. Finally, all of our efforts are being driven with sustainability in mind. 
At our annual sustainability report published at the beginning of June, we disclosed initial sustainability targets, including plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use. We are also working closely with customers, investors and ESG rating companies to make sure they are up to speed on all these developments and have a full appreciation for our efforts. 
So with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

The China market is very dependent for its growth on imported spodumene. So -- and there is a shortfall of available supply to meet demand given the rapid growth post pandemic, particularly in carbonate in China. So in that regard, maybe spodumene is a bit of a lead because it's the short supply. 
But I think what we expect to happen is more supply to come into China from other parts of the world. We've seen prices go up and stay up with demand. It's hard to say what's going to happen with spodumene prices. From an Albemarle perspective, the way we take advantage of that is we don't sell spodumene or that's right, we don't sell chemical grade spodumene to say we sell a specialty spodumene for the glass market. 
But for us, it's tolling. So you've heard us talk about looking at tolling opportunities, and that's part of our improved guidance. And for that, we're able to participate in that spot price market, which is, as I've said earlier, very favorable."

First of all, I don't think we've said 30,000 tonnes. We've talked about ramp rates on plants. So the Kemerton plant with a start-up in the early part of next year, there is a 3-month delay to the second unit. We've talked about getting to full run rate capacity by the end of the second year in that facility. 
Similarly, in carbonate, you'd see a phenomenon that is somewhat like that. I would say our run rate for carbonate by the end of '22 will probably be at the 30,000-run rate basis at the end of the year, that ramps. It's a little bit different, ramping brine versus spodumene because brine is obviously a harvested material versus a fixed input. 
But that roughly should -- between those 2 should be able to calculate sort of our guidance. The change would be a slight delay at Kemerton. And then a year-on-year growth that we can achieve in tolling.

So I think that applies across for hard rock as well as kind of the salt -- conversion capacity for the salt. So I think as the industry gets bigger, each addition is a smaller percentage of the total industry, it has less of an impact. That said, where we are, I mean, spodumene is tight.

Those are pretty tight and you've got to make investments, and you've got to be good at executing those projects and commissioning them and then ramping them up to full capacity, which is we think we're good at that, but we're in the process of proving it."

If we had more carbonate that we could produce and sell, we could sell it readily, same with hydroxide. We don't have the disadvantage. We have the ability.

That's a strength we have going forward. What we're limited on is our ability to get conversion capacity in the ground quickly. So -- and that's part of our plan for next year. As to the long term, my guess would be that our view would be, I should say, that hydroxide will probably see the higher rate of growth going forward off a smaller base. 
Carbonate has done well in the near term based upon the LFP trend for lower-end vehicles, particularly in China, and we see that starting to take root in some other regions as well for the low end. But the key to high EV penetration is higher energy density. And the key to that is hydroxide and ultimately, potentially solid-state chemistries. So that's going to require a heavier burden on hydroxide. We see that being the tighter market on a long-term basis going forward."

So it's more intensive. It actually also consumes a lot more water and energy given the -- so it has some drawbacks from it. We're studying what alternatives we could deploy to a resource like that, that could include absorption that optimize those factors of cost and sustainability.

And so the companies you're referring to are largely here in the U.S. There's a set of companies similarly in Europe. It's a regional business model because of the collection and nature of different regulations around the world. 
As a global player, we're engaged with all of these companies. We view them in almost every case as a partner, not a competitor. And we bring process technology and know-how that -- what we deploy in some of our existing virgin brine operations that could be a partnership approach to helping to remove the lithium and/or take a byproduct that comes out of their operations, which is lithium rich. 
So that's the way we work with them. You have to remember, a lot of these companies got set up, and this is -- and then Europe is ahead on this, largely to go after the nickel and the cobalt not lithium. Lithium is usually the byproduct of the recycling operation, that's where we fit in. And so as we look at trying to partner with our customers and drive their success from a sustainability standpoint, we view this as an important part of the value mix we bring is helping them recycle the lithium and recycle it back to them for their continued growth. 
On the Tesla side, we view what Tesla has described as very -- generally very consistent with our market outlook. It's going to continue to shift, and I think, expand, meaning the size of the EV market, which by 2025 might be at one level, but by 2030, I think you're going to have a larger proportion of vehicles that are electrified. Some news out about -- some intentions around that here in the U.S. today. 
And for the lower end, LFP is the applicable technology. I mean it gives you a lower range. We still believe, though, that for the mid and the higher range vehicles, you're going to need -- in order to get -- you need higher energy density to get the range. And you can drive good cost if you can get good technology and then get the cost per kilowatt hour down, you don't get the kilowatt hours up per unit weight. So that's the mix we see.

But I don't have the numbers to share with you to exactly what it would be. And the other part of that question, which we don't really know the answer to is how is the portfolio, what does it look like? How much of that bot-type pricing will we end up with versus that long-term contract pricing. Because during the last peak and bottom they were pretty much -- were all on the long-term contracts."

And -- so I surmise, most of that is coming from more volumes from via Greenbushes and that spodumene being converted downstream via tollers. 
First, is that an accurate characterization? And then with that in mind, Eric, I'm pretty sure you've stated in the past that you don't rely on toll conversion for battery-grade chemicals, but only for technical grade lithium products. But in this case, it seems like the extra volumes are carbonate feeding into the LFP cathode market. So just wondering if that also is accurate? 
And if that's the case, should we be thinking of these carbonate grades via tollers as just -- or maybe just the LFP market being more of a technical grade market? And then finally, just -- it seems like this is part of the market you'll address once La Negra is ramped next year.

We just had a customer meeting this week with a large North American refiner who was telling us that because they're starting to operate at higher rates, they're needing to run under more severe conditions, they need higher-performance catalysts.

On today's call, I will highlight our quarterly results, provide an update on our goals for 2021 and discuss the progress of our ongoing expansion plans. Scott will provide more detail on our results, outlook and guidance.
We reported another solid quarter with net sales of $831 million and adjusted EBITDA of $218 million. Sales improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year. Excluding FCS from our third quarter 2020 results, our net sales were 19% higher and EBITDA was up 14%. Scott will get into more detail on our financials in a few minutes including favorable revisions to our guidance. As we stated in our earnings release this morning, we increased our guidance based on the third quarter results.
During our recent Investor Day, we did a deep dive into our accelerated growth strategy and provided color on how we think about the near-term expansion of our Lithium business as well as our disciplined investment approach. Since that event in early September, we are pleased to have announced several updates on those efforts. This includes signing an agreement to acquire Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials, or Tianyuan, which owns a recently built conversion plant near Qinzhou. We are totaling to ensure the plant operates as advertised and expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of next year. This puts us on track for first sales from this plant in the first half of next year.
In addition to this plant, we have signed 2 recent agreements for investments in China to support 2 greenfield projects, each initially targeting 50,000 metric tons per year. These projects position us for initial added conversion capacity of up to 150,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide on an annual basis to meet our customers' growing demands. In addition, our MARBL joint venture announced the restart of the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. 
On Slide 5, you will see the objectives we set for 2021. When we set these goals, we did so with the intent of challenging ourselves with plans that were aggressive, but achievable. As we approach the end of the year, I'm excited by the significant progress and proud of the effort our team has put into achieving these goals. As you see on this slide, we have accomplished the vast majority of what we set out to do. For example, we are successfully progressing high-return, fast payback roaming projects at both Magnolia and JBC. These projects will increase our capacity and improve the efficiencies of our operations. We've also made significant progress on our lithium growth projects.
Now let's turn to Slide 6. First, at La Negra III and IV, our team continues to execute to plan. I'm excited to announce that we recently completed a major milestone by achieving first lithium carbonate production in late October. Initial production volumes will be used to qualify the plant and the material with our customers to ensure we are meeting their requirements. This qualification process is proceeding on track with first sales expected in the first half of next year.
In Western Australia, the ongoing labor shortages and pandemic-related travel restrictions have continued to significantly impact virtually all companies in that region and show no signs of easing in the near term. Despite these efforts and with Herculean efforts, our team has managed to hold Kemerton I construction completion to year-end 2021. We now expect Kemerton II construction completion in the second half of 2022. While we are facing challenges at these projects, our strategy to consolidate resources and prioritize the first train continues to mitigate additional risks.
On Slide 7, I'll highlight the progress we've made on our Wave 3 program since we last spoke to you at our Investor Day. At the end of September, we announced an agreement to acquire Tianyuan for $200 million, including a recently built conversion plant near the port of Qinzhou designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year with the potential to expand to 50,000 metric tons per year. We expect this acquisition to follow a similar path as our acquisitions of Xinyu and Chengdu facilities back in 2016. Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of next year, we plan to make additional investments to bring Qinzhou plant to Albemarle standards and ramp to initial production of 25,000 metric tons. This acquisition enables us to accelerate conversion capacity growth and leverage our world-class resource base.
Together with our partner, we agreed to restart operations at the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. Initially, Wodgina will begin 1 of 3 processing lines, each of which can produce up to 250,000 metric tons of lithium spodumene concentrate. This resource will be critical as we ramp our conversion capacity in Western Australia with our Kemerton sites.
We also signed agreements to invest in 2 greenfield conversion sites in China at Zhangjiagang and Meishan. We plan to build identical conversion plants with initial target production of 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at each site. These investments offer additional optionality for future growth and have expansion potential. Investing in China offers capital-efficient, high-return growth with proximity to our low-cost Australian spodumene resources and many of our major cathode and battery customers. We continue to explore global expansion of our conversion capacity as the battery supply chain shifts west.
Turning to Slide 8 for a review of our global project pipeline. As you can see, Albemarle is executing a robust pipeline of projects all around the world. For example, our bromine business is pursuing incremental expansions in Jordan and the United States. These high-return projects leverage our low-cost resources and technical know-how to support customers in growing and diverse markets, like electronics, telecom and automotive.
In Chile, the Salar Yield Improvement Project allows us to increase lithium production without increasing our brine pumping rates utilizing a proprietary technology to improve efficiency and sustainability. In Australia, we continue to progress study work on additional Kemerton expansions to leverage greater scale and efficiency with repeatable designs. Finally, in the United States, we are expanding our Silver Peak facility in Nevada to double lithium carbonate production. This is the first of several options to expand local U.S. production. In Kings Mountain, North Carolina, we continue to evaluate restarting our mine. And at our bromine facility in Magnolia, Arkansas, we're evaluating the process technologies to leverage our brines to extract lithium.
We'll continue to update you periodically on our pipeline. I hope this gives you a sense of the diversity and optionality Albemarle has as a global lithium producer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a look at the financials."

During the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year. This improvement was driven by strong sales for our lithium and bromine segments. Adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, resulting from the sale of FCS and increased freight and raw material costs. The GAAP net loss of $393 million includes a $505 million after-tax charge related to the recently announced Huntsman arbitration decision. While we continue to assess our legal options, we have also initiated discussions with Huntsman regarding a potential resolution. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS was $1.05 for the quarter, down 4% from the prior year.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. PAUSE Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $218 million increased by 14% or $27 million compared to the prior year, excluding the sale of FCS. Higher adjusted EBITDA for lithium and bromine was partially offset by a $13.5 million out-of-period adjustment regarding inventory valuation in our international locations, impacting all 3 GBUs. Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased by $25 million year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange. We were able to offset the limited impact of a 1-month strike in the Salar in Chile, thanks to higher tolling volumes and higher spodumene shipments from our Talison joint venture.
Adjusted EBITDA for bromine increased by $5 million compared to the prior year due to higher pricing partially offset by increased freight and raw material costs. Volumes were flat given the chlorine constraints in the quarter. And Catalyst adjusted EBITDA declined $4 million from the previous year. This was due to lower sales and cost pressures, partially offset by higher-than-expected joint venture income, which included a favorable tax settlement in Brazil.
Slide 11 highlights the company's financial strength that is key to our ability to execute our growth plans over the coming years. Our net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.7x and is below our targeted long-term range of 2x to 2.5x. This provides us with capacity to fund growth while supporting modest dividend increases. We don't expect the recent arbitration decision to impact our current growth plans, but it could temporarily reduce our flexibility to take advantage of upside growth opportunities.
Turning to Slide 12, I'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that Kent mentioned earlier. Higher full year 2021 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects our strong third quarter performance. Net cash from operations guidance is unchanged due to the timing of shipments to customers and increased raw materials and inventory costs. Capital expenditures were revised higher related to the continuing tight labor markets and COVID-related travel restrictions in Western Australia, as well as accelerated investments in growth.
Turning to Slide 13 for a more detailed outlook on each of our GBUs. Lithium's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. That's up from our previous guidance due to higher volumes and pricing. The volume growth is driven primarily by tolling. And our full year average realized pricing is now expected to be flat to slightly higher compared to 2020. As a reminder, most of our battery-grade lithium sales are on long-term contracts with structured pricing mechanisms that are partially exposed to the market. We also benefit from stronger market pricing on shorter-term technical grade sales and on spot and tolling sales of battery-grade lithium.
Full year 2021 average margins are expected to remain below 35% due to higher costs related to the project startups and tolling partially offset by productivity improvements. Bromine's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth is now expected to be in the low double digits. That's also up from previous guidance due to the continued strength in demand and pricing for flame retardants. Our bromine volumes remain constrained due to sold-out conditions and a lack of inventory. The outlook for chlorine availability has improved since last quarter, but the market remains tight, and the impact of higher chlorine pricing is expected to be felt more in 2022 than in 2021 due to the timing of inventory changes and shipments. Year-to-date, higher bromine pricing has mostly offset higher raw material and freight costs.
Catalyst full year 2021 EBITDA is now expected to decline between 20% and 25%. That's also an improvement from our previous guidance, owing to the higher-than-expected joint venture income. The year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm earlier in the year, product mix and the previously disclosed change in our customers' order patterns. Catalyst fourth quarter margins will also be impacted by product mix, including a greater proportion of lower-margin FCC and CFT resid orders. FCC demand continues to improve with increasing global fuel demand, while HPC orders continue to be delayed. Overall, market conditions are improving but volumes and Catalysts are not expected to return to prepandemic levels until late 2022 or 2023.
In total, we expect EBITDA margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to higher raw materials, energy and freight costs across all 3 of our businesses. We are closely watching several key risk factors, including global supply chain disruptions, global impacts of the energy rationing in China and chip shortages. Supply chain and logistics challenges are the most immediate. Our teams are working day and night to navigate these port issues, the lack of drivers and upstream supply disruptions to ensure our customers get their orders on time.
We also continue to monitor the global situation with regard to chip shortages. We recognize that the auto industry has been struggling with those shortages. But to date, we have not seen a direct impact on either our lithium or bromine orders.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent."

As Scott mentioned, we are disappointed by the outcome of the Huntsman arbitration decision. But regardless of the ultimate outcome of that dispute, Albemarle will continue to focus on the execution of our growth strategy.
As we highlighted during our Investor Day in September, we have a well thought out and focused operating model that we are implementing across our businesses. This model, the Albemarle Way of Excellence, provides us with a framework to execute our objectives effectively and efficiently and will help us to remain on target as we pursue significant growth opportunities ahead. And as we pursue these opportunities, we will be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. Our primary capital priority is accelerating high-return growth. This means that we will invest not just to get bigger but to create tangible shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. Utilizing this approach with our low-cost resources, we believe our annual adjusted EBITDA will triple by 2026.
Finally, at the core of all of this is sustainability. As one of the world's largest lithium producers and innovators, we were able to work closely with our customers to create value and drive better sustainability outcomes for all stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. I'll hand over to the operator."

We have a lot of analytics suite and customer dialogues up and down the supply chain from OEMs all the way back through the battery and cathode producers to assess those trends. What we believe and has been confirmed in our discussions with customers is while there is an uptick in LFP demand, there's also been an uptick in vehicle production outlook as well for electric vehicles. And where LFP is occupying a sweet spot is in the lower cost range -- lower cost and lower driving range portion of the vehicle mix. For some automotive producers, that will be a larger percent of their mix than others. Bottom line, we see strong growth in both of those products, albeit we see still pretty -- the growth rate in hydroxide will be higher over the coming 5 years. And hence, we feel we're extremely well positioned. We're bringing on 40,000 tons of carbonate capacity as we speak. And we have the hydroxide expansion strategy in addition to the Kemerton ramp that Kent earlier described and feel we're well positioned to meet both LFP demand and rising high nickel demand for cathodes."

So we're having discussions with certain customers who are contracting for increments of time into the future. Say, '23 to '26 or '24 to '28. Those are the kinds of durations that people are thinking about, and that's largely driven by the investments made on the automotive side. From a pricing standpoint, you can imagine because prices are rising, there's certainly a desire on behalf of those buyers if they can to not have to pay spot prices. But the reality is they're either -- the discussion is either towards a much higher fixed price if they want some stability in their pricing term or we're pricing against that an established index so that it will rise with time.
Now remember, the price you gave was a spodumene price when you said $2,800 a ton. The pricing in China is on a U.S. basis is in high 20s, close to 30 on a delivered basis. When you look at many of the indices around the world, most of these people are buying against a blend. And so the pricing around that is not quite as high, but it's still well into the high teens, if not the low 20s of where a lot of those pricing indices are. So we continue to have a discussion with customers and -- but those are some of the dynamics at play, which are leading us to long-term contracts with significantly higher price potential than what we've seen in the past."

We see what's happening, but they're rewriting their constitution and there'll be changes in Chile. I think that Chile wants to participate in lithium industry. They're looking to expand their participation, the contracts, the agreements they have with us are very progressive, so they participate as prices go up. So that's an upside for them. So I believe they want to participate in that economically, but there's a lot happening in Chile at the moment, and we're watching it very closely."

But I wanted to kind of delve a little bit into it a little bit more because I know you said it's a bridging strategy and maybe we can be opportunistic. But you're sitting on a fair amount of latent capacity at Greenbushes. And the read seems to be that converters are struggling to find enough merchant supply of spodumene to actually kind of continue to operate in some respect. So why not get more aggressive on the volume? I have to think, one, prices right now are really attractive. But, two, almost somewhat concerning as it relates to the potential for overinvestment and overheating in markets and things like that. I feel like if you -- with your volume, you might have an ability to kind of regulate this a little bit."

On today's call, I will highlight our quarterly results, provide an update on our goals for 2021 and discuss the progress of our ongoing expansion plans. Scott will provide more detail on our results, outlook, and guidance. 
We reported another solid quarter with net sales of $831 million and adjusted EBITDA of $218 million. Sales improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year. Excluding FCS from our third quarter 2020 results, our net sales were 19% higher and EBITDA was up 14%. Scott will get into more detail on our financials in a few minutes including favorable revisions to our guidance. As we stated in our earnings release this morning, we increased our guidance based on the third quarter results. 
During our recent Investor Day, we did a deep dive into our accelerated growth strategy and provided color on how we think about the near-term expansion of our Lithium business as well as our disciplined investment approach. Since that event in early September, we are pleased to have announced several updates on those efforts. This includes signing an agreement to acquire Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials, or Tianyuan, which owns a recently built conversion plant near Qinzhou. We are totaling to ensure the plant operates as advertised and expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of next year. This puts us on track for first sales from this plant in the first half of next year. 
In addition to this plant, we have signed 2 recent agreements for investments in China to support 2 greenfield projects, each initially targeting 50,000 metric tons per year. These projects position us for initial added conversion capacity of up to 150,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide on an annual basis to meet our customers' growing demands. In addition, our MARBL joint venture announced the restart of the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia.  
On Slide 5, you will see the objectives we set for 2021. When we set these goals, we did so with the intent of challenging ourselves with plans that were aggressive, but achievable. As we approach the end of the year, I'm excited by the significant progress and proud of the effort our team has put into achieving these goals. As you see on this slide, we have accomplished the vast majority of what we set out to do. For example, we are successfully progressing high-return, fast payback Bromine projects at both Magnolia and JBC. These projects will increase our capacity and improve the efficiencies of our operations. We've also made significant progress on our lithium growth projects. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6. First, at La Negra III and IV, our team continues to execute to plan. I'm excited to announce that we recently completed a major milestone by achieving first lithium carbonate production in late October. Initial production volumes will be used to qualify the plant and the material with our customers to ensure we are meeting their requirements. This qualification process is proceeding on track with first sales expected in the first half of next year. 
In Western Australia, the ongoing labor shortages and pandemic-related travel restrictions have continued to significantly impact virtually all companies in that region and show no signs of easing in the near term. Despite these efforts and with Herculean efforts, our team has managed to hold Kemerton I construction completion to year-end 2021. We now expect Kemerton II construction completion in the second half of 2022. While we are facing challenges at these projects, our strategy to consolidate resources and prioritize the first train continues to mitigate additional risks. 
On Slide 7, I'll highlight the progress we've made on our Wave III program since we last spoke to you at our Investor Day. At the end of September, we announced an agreement to acquire Tianyuan for $200 million, including a recently built conversion plant near the port of Qinzhou designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year with the potential to expand to 50,000 metric tons per year.
We expect this acquisition to follow a similar path as our acquisitions of Xinyu and Chengdu facilities back in 2016. Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of next year, we plan to make additional investments to bring Qinzhou plant to Albemarle standards and ramp to initial production of 25,000 metric tons. This acquisition enables us to accelerate conversion capacity growth and leverage our world-class resource base. 
Together with our partner, we agreed to restart operations at the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. Initially, Wodgina will begin 1 of 3 processing lines, each of which can produce up to 250,000 metric tons of lithium spodumene concentrate. This resource will be critical as we ramp our conversion capacity in Western Australia with our Kemerton sites. 
We also signed agreements to invest in 2 greenfield conversion sites in China at Zhangjiagang and Meishan. We plan to build identical conversion plants with initial target production of 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at each site. These investments offer additional optionality for future growth and have expansion potential. Investing in China offers capital-efficient, high-return growth with proximity to our low-cost Australian spodumene resources and many of our major cathode and battery customers. We continue to explore global expansion of our conversion capacity as the battery supply chain shifts west. 
Turning to Slide 8 for a review of our global project pipeline. As you can see, Albemarle is executing a robust pipeline of projects all around the world. For example, our bromine business is pursuing incremental expansions in Jordan and the United States. These high-return projects leverage our low-cost resources and technical know-how to support customers in growing and diverse markets, like electronics, telecom and automotive. 
In Chile, the Salar Yield Improvement Project allows us to increase lithium production without increasing our brine pumping rates utilizing a proprietary technology to improve efficiency and sustainability. In Australia, we continue to progress study work on additional Kemerton expansions to leverage greater scale and efficiency with repeatable designs. Finally, in the United States, we are expanding our Silver Peak facility in Nevada to double lithium carbonate production. This is the first of several options to expand local U.S. production. In Kings Mountain, North Carolina, we continue to evaluate restarting our mine. And at our bromine facility in Magnolia, Arkansas, we're evaluating the process technologies to leverage our brines to extract lithium. 
We'll continue to update you periodically on our pipeline. I hope this gives you a sense of the diversity and optionality Albemarle has as a global lithium producer. I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a look at the financials."
18671,1682438221,2425054,"Albemarle Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 9. During the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year. This improvement was driven by strong sales for our lithium and bromine s",979,"Thanks, Kent, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 9. 
During the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year. This improvement was driven by strong sales for our lithium and bromine segments. Adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, resulting from the sale of FCS and increased freight and raw material costs. The GAAP net loss of $393 million includes a $505 million after-tax charge related to the recently announced Huntsman arbitration decision. While we continue to assess our legal options, we have also initiated discussions with Huntsman regarding a potential resolution. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS was $1.05 for the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 for a look at adjusted EBITDA by business. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $218 million increased by 14% or $27 million compared to the prior year, excluding the sale of FCS. Higher adjusted EBITDA for lithium and bromine was partially offset by a $13.5 million out-of-period adjustment regarding inventory valuation in our international locations, impacting all 3 GBUs. Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased by $25 million year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange. We were able to offset the limited impact of a 1-month strike in the Salar in Chile, thanks to higher tolling volumes and higher spodumene shipments from our Talison joint venture. 
Adjusted EBITDA for bromine increased by $5 million compared to the prior year due to higher pricing partially offset by increased freight and raw material costs. Volumes were flat given the chlorine constraints in the quarter. And Catalyst adjusted EBITDA declined $4 million from the previous year. This was due to lower sales and cost pressures, partially offset by higher-than-expected joint venture income, which included a favorable tax settlement in Brazil. 
Slide 11 highlights the company's financial strength that is key to our ability to execute our growth plans over the coming years. Our net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.7x and is below our targeted long-term range of 2x to 2.5x. This provides us with capacity to fund growth while supporting modest dividend increases. We don't expect the recent arbitration decision to impact our current growth plans, but it could temporarily reduce our flexibility to take advantage of upside growth opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that Kent mentioned earlier. Higher full year 2021 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects our strong third quarter performance. Net cash from operations guidance is unchanged due to the timing of shipments to customers and increased raw materials and inventory costs. Capital expenditures were revised higher related to the continuing tight labor markets and COVID-related travel restrictions in Western Australia, as well as accelerated investments in growth. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a more detailed outlook on each of our GBUs. Lithium's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. That's up from our previous guidance due to higher volumes and pricing. The volume growth is driven primarily by tolling. And our full year average realized pricing is now expected to be flat to slightly higher compared to 2020. As a reminder, most of our battery-grade lithium sales are on long-term contracts with structured pricing mechanisms that are partially exposed to the market. We also benefit from stronger market pricing on shorter-term technical grade sales and on spot and tolling sales of battery-grade lithium. 
Full year 2021 average margins are expected to remain below 35% due to higher costs related to the project startups and tolling partially offset by productivity improvements. Bromine's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth is now expected to be in the low double digits. That's also up from previous guidance due to the continued strength in demand and pricing for flame retardants. Our bromine volumes remain constrained due to sold-out conditions and a lack of inventory. The outlook for chlorine availability has improved since last quarter, but the market remains tight and the impact of higher chlorine pricing is expected to be felt more in 2022 than in 2021 due to the timing of inventory changes and shipments. 
Year-to-date, higher bromine pricing has mostly offset higher raw material and freight costs. 
Catalyst full year 2021 EBITDA is now expected to decline between 20% and 25%. That's also an improvement from our previous guidance, owing to the higher-than-expected joint venture income. The year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm earlier in the year, product mix and the previously disclosed change in our customers' order patterns. Catalyst fourth quarter margins will also be impacted by product mix, including a greater proportion of lower-margin FCC and CFT resid orders. FCC demand continues to improve with increasing global fuel demand, while HPC orders continue to be delayed. Overall, market conditions are improving but volumes and Catalysts are not expected to return to prepandemic levels until late 2022 or 2023. 
In total, we expect EBITDA margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to higher raw materials, energy and freight costs across all 3 of our businesses. We are closely watching several key risk factors, including global supply chain disruptions, global impacts of the energy rationing in China and chip shortages. Supply chain and logistics challenges are the most immediate. Our teams are working day and night to navigate these port issues, the lack of drivers and upstream supply disruptions to ensure our customers get their orders on time. 
We also continue to monitor the global situation with regard to chip shortages. We recognize that the auto industry has been struggling with those shortages. But to date, we have not seen a direct impact on either our lithium or bromine orders. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent."

As Scott mentioned, we are disappointed by the outcome of the Huntsman arbitration decision. But regardless of the ultimate outcome of that dispute, Albemarle will continue to focus on the execution of our growth strategy. 
As we highlighted during our Investor Day in September, we have a well thought out and focused operating model that we are implementing across our businesses. This model, the Albemarle Way of Excellence, provides us with a framework to execute our objectives effectively and efficiently and will help us to remain on target as we pursue significant growth opportunities ahead. And as we pursue these opportunities, we will be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. Our primary capital priority is accelerating high-return growth. This means that we will invest not just to get bigger but to create tangible shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. Utilizing this approach with our low-cost resources, we believe our annual adjusted EBITDA will triple by 2026. 
Finally, at the core of all of this is sustainability. As one of the world's largest lithium producers and innovators, we were able to work closely with our customers to create value and drive better sustainability outcomes for all stakeholders. 
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. I'll hand over to the operator."

So we're having discussions with certain customers who are contracting for increments of time into the future, say, '23 to '26 or '24 to '28. 
Those are the kinds of durations that people are thinking about, and that's largely driven by the investments made on the automotive side. From a pricing standpoint, you can imagine because prices are rising, there's certainly a desire on behalf of those buyers if they can to not have to pay spot prices. But the reality is they're either -- the discussion is either towards a much higher fixed price if they want some stability in their pricing term or we're pricing against that an established index so that it will rise with time.
Now remember, the price you gave was a spodumene price when you said $2,800 a ton (sic) [ $28,000 plus per ton ]. The pricing in China is on a U.S. basis is in high 20s, close to 30 on a delivered basis. When you look at many of the indices around the world, most of these people are buying against a blend. And so the pricing around that is not quite as high, but it's still well into the high teens, if not the low 20s of where a lot of those pricing indices are. So we continue to have a discussion with customers and -- but those are some of the dynamics at play, which are leading us to long-term contracts with significantly higher price potential than what we've seen in the past."

But I wanted to kind of delve a little bit into it a little bit more because I know you said it's a bridging strategy and maybe we can be opportunistic. But you're sitting on a fair amount of latent capacity at Greenbushes. And the read seems to be that converters are struggling to find enough merchant supply of spodumene to actually kind of continue to operate in some respect. 
So why not get more aggressive on the volume? I have to think, one, prices right now are really attractive. But, two, almost somewhat concerning as it relates to the potential for overinvestment and overheating in markets and things like that. I feel like if you -- with your volume, you might have an ability to kind of regulate this a little bit."

So now we're ramping and getting more spodumene going to give us optionality from spodumene standpoint going forward, but we still have to make sure we choose the ones and Eric talked about it before, there are people -- there are tollers that we have relationships with that have been previously qualified or currently qualified with our customers. 
So you have to fit in all those elements into it. And to really ramp it up, it would be -- it's not a 6-month strategy. It's going to take a little longer to implement that. Eric, you want to add anything?"
