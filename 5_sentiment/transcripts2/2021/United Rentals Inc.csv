As we look back on the past year, I feel that 2020 was a proven ground for our company. It gave us the opportunity to prove the resiliency of our business model and the disciplines we've engineered for more than a decade, things like capital management, cost management, operational agility and the willingness of our team to embrace change. We've demonstrated these capabilities during choppy periods in the past, but last year wasn't just a downturn, it was a sharp and significant economic disruption. And we stood up to those conditions while keeping our people safe, streamlining our operating costs, aggressively flexing our CapEx and managing our excess capital to reduce leverage.
In addition, we kept our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to within 50 basis points of 2019, despite significantly lower market demand, and we generated record free cash flow. And now things are getting better. Most of our end markets have been on a steady path to recovery since the third quarter, and we saw that continue in Q4.
These factors help us narrow the gap in rental revenue year-over-year from being down over 13% in Q3 to down just 10% in Q4. And as you saw yesterday, our fourth quarter results were better than our guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
I was also pleased that, throughout 2020, we stayed laser-focused on execution, while remaining flexible and agile in a very fluid environment. And most importantly, we never wavered from our fierce determination to take great care of our employees and our customers.
We didn't resort to reactive cuts in our service capacity that would harm our customer service or slow us down in the upcycle or impact our long-term earnings power. Early on, we committed to keeping the key in the ignition on capacity, so we could start the engine up at any time. And as we enter '21, this has proven to be the right decision. The execution of that decision rests squarely with our people, and they have consistently delivered. They're the reason why our safety reportable rate remained below 1 for all 4 quarters of 2020. And it's a credit to their professionalism, and our COVID protocols were adopted so quickly company-wide, allowing us to serve our customers safely.
And the financial results you saw yesterday were generated by the talent and commitment of our people, all working together as one UR. It's an exceptional team, and I'm very proud to work beside them.
Now let's look forward to the current year. COVID is in a traditional cycle, but it's a cycle nonetheless, and we believe it will continue to have an impact for the foreseeable future. As our guidance indicates, we'll continue to gain ground in '21 as we work our way back towards pre-COVID levels. 
Our sentiment echos the majority of our customers in our recent surveys, the comments we hear from the field and other external data points we've collected. We're optimistic of the year, while being realistic that visibility is still somewhat limited. 
What our guidance doesn't show is the cadence of demand this year. But once we lapped the first quarter, our toughest comp will be behind us, and then we expect to return to growth as we move through '21. 
And we base this on a couple of factors. The recent spike in COVID cases is projected to settle down in the coming months, which should help reactivate some projects that were temporarily halted. And as the vaccines are rolled out, business confidence should continue to improve. And this will provide a tailwind for both capital projects and MRO spending. And as demand trends up, we're well positioned to be first call for our customers.
And before I get into our operating environment, I want to mention our fourth quarter revenue from used equipment sales. It was $275 million, almost 13% higher than prior year, and it was driven by healthy retail demand. And as you know, we look at the strength of the used equipment market as a key indicator for the rental industry. And when the retail market is favorable, it tells us that contractors are projecting needs for that fleet.
Another positive indicator is that our industry overall showed great discipline on the supply side in 2020, and this is a good place to be as activity ramps up. Looking at our operating environment, there are some encouraging signs. The verticals, we called out as most resilient on our last call, are continuing to lead project activity in markets like power, health care, distribution and technology. Within these verticals, we're looking at a range of jobs, including data centers, hospitals, warehouses and even power plants.
And on the other side of the ledger, petrochem continued to be soft in the fourth quarter. The good news is that we're seeing light at the end of the COVID tunnel, and we expect this sector to do better this year led by scheduled turnaround activity in downstream and chemical process.
Within nonres, which is our largest revenue base, a number of new projects put ground in the fourth quarter and others plan to start up this year. These include some big stadium projects that were postponed when COVID hit. 
And the same is true of airport construction and renovation. We see a number of these multiyear projects back on the table. And to a lesser degree, road and bridge work, which generally has remained steady. 
Infrastructure has been topical since the election. And while the details and the timing are unknown at this point, President Biden has been clear that this will be a priority for his administration. And as the economy continues to heal, United Rentals is in a strong position to benefit from any increase in end market spending, including infrastructure. And we've invested for years in positioning the company for this type of scenario.
Our Specialty segment had another good quarter, led by our power and HVAC business, which generated fourth quarter same-store revenue that was higher than the prior year. It underscores the importance of our ongoing investments in specialty operations. In total, we plan to open another 30 specialty cold starts this year, which is double the number that we opened last year. And this will bring us close to 400 specialty locations by December.
Here's the main point of my comments this morning. You may recall our mantra that figure doesn't really matter unless we're constantly driving for better. And the way we get there is by doing what we say we're going to do. 2020 did its best the challenges on that, but we came through for all of our stakeholders, and the learnings we gained from that experience have been incorporated into our operations. And we'll leverage these learnings as we return to growth.
Finally, we said we would fulfill our responsibility to investors by protecting the long-term earnings power of the business, and we're doing that, too. The takeaway from 2020 isn't what went wrong in the external environment, it's what went right when we committed to a course of action and met our goals. Yesterday, you saw the results of that commitment. And today, we're telling you that we intend to deliver again in '21.
So I'll stop here and ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. So Jess, over to you."

Our financial results in the fourth quarter were better than we expected, with rental volumes continuing to recover and strong used sales activity at retail, and more on both in a minute.Costs were in line and s",1031,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results in the fourth quarter were better than we expected, with rental volumes continuing to recover and strong used sales activity at retail, and more on both in a minute.
Costs were in line and supported by -- supported solid margins in the quarter. Free cash flow for the year also exceeded expectations, and our leverage at year-end was down versus 2019. That's all good news as we move into 2021.
I'll provide some color on our '21 guidance before we get to Q&A. Let's start now with the results for the quarter. Rental revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.85 billion, which was lower by $208 million or 10.1% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER decreased $190 million or 10.9%. In that, a 5.6% decline in the average size of the fleet was a $98 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $25 million, and fleet productivity was down 3.8% or a $67 million impact. 
Sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 420 basis points, mainly from better fleet absorption. Rounding out the decline in rental revenue for the quarter was $18 million in lower ancillary and re-rent revenues.
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger-than-expected in the quarter, coming in at $275 million. That's an increase of $31 million or about 13% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by an increase in retail sales. That reflected OEC sold up 35% year-over-year in the retail channel for the second quarter in a row.
Used margins in the quarter were solid at 42.5%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at just shy of 50% of original cost.
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $1.04 billion, a decline of $117 million or 10.1% year-over-year. The dollar change includes a $143 million headwind from rental. And in that, OER made up $140 million and ancillary and re-rent together with the remaining $3 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $11 million, which offset a $3 million headwind from our other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was another benefit in the quarter of $18 million, with the majority of that help coming from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 45.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was about 66%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, used sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a headwind to margin and flow-through.
Second, I mentioned on our Q3 call, back in October, that we had a benefit in bonus expense in Q4 2019 that would cause a drag this Q4. Adjusting for those 2 items implies a margin of 46.1% and flow-through for the quarter of just over 56%. Both results were largely as expected and pointed to continuing cost discipline even as certain operating costs started to normalize.
A quick comment on adjusted EPS, which was $5.04 That compares with $5.60 in Q4 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower net income from lower revenue.
Let's move to CapEx. For the quarter, rental CapEx was $176 million, bringing our full year spend to $961 million in gross rental CapEx, which was 55% less than what we spent in 2019. Proceeds in 2020 from used equipment sales were $858 million, resulting in net CapEx of $103 million.
ROIC remained strong at year-end, coming in at 8.9%. That continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital, which currently runs about 7%. Year-over-year, ROIC was lower by 150 basis points, primarily due to the decline in revenue. 
Turning to free cash flow, which was a record for us at over $2.4 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of over $860 million versus 2019. As we look at the balance sheet, our having dedicated the majority of our free cash flow to debt reduction in 2020 resulted in a $1.9 billion or almost 17% decrease year-over-year in net debt. Leverage was 2.4x at year-end, down from 2.6x at the end of 2019.
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished 2020 with just under $3.1 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.7 billion and availability on our AR facility of $166 million. We also had $202 million in cash.
Let's shift to our 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. Our view to total revenue includes a return to growth in rental revenue with the season, starting in April. We look forward to getting past a challenging comp in Q1 as we lapped the start of the pandemic and move to delivering rental growth for the rest of the year. Our guidance includes a range of outcomes given our seasonal patterns and assumptions we've made on the pace of continuing recovery across our end markets. We're planning for another strong year in used sales, and we'll look to increase our CapEx spend to replace that fleet.
Within our guidance, that reflects over $1.9 billion in replacement CapEx. Beyond that, we continue to be focused on absorbing the fleet we own and we'll adjust our growth capital accordingly with total spend planned at pre-COVID levels. Our range on adjusted EBITDA considers not only the volume growth we expect in revenue, but also our continuing to manage costs tightly. We'll leverage what we've learned in 2020 using our own capacity to support our customers with less reliance on third-parties. As our business continues to recover, we'll also see a reset of costs that ran low in 2020, such as T&E and bonuses.
Finally, one of the best indicators of the strength of our business model is the resiliency of our cash flow, especially as we invest behind growth. In 2021, we expect another year of generating significant free cash flow, and that's after considering a return to over $2 billion in CapEx spending. We'll continue to use our free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce our leverage.

When I think about how the industry has responded to this downturn, specifically compared to the '09 downturn, which was quite a different scenario, the route data tells us that we're almost in balance already from a days in fleet, days on rent. 
We're not quite there yet, but a heck a lot closer than I would have thought. So I think we're already in pretty good shape. And now it's just about the opportunities that we can lean into. And we do see growth headroom over the next few years.
This year may be a little less than what we'll see in the future years, but I'll also say that this headline growth just use the midpoint of 3.5% is a little bit misleading because it's having to absorb what is a tough comp in Q1. And when you model that out, you see the quarters 2 through 4 are actually significantly higher than the 3.5% average you see.

And that will -- I won't use the word, stabilize, that negative will decrease throughout the year. Our cadence -- think about our cadence as being a normal capital spend cadence, maybe a little lighter in Q1. As you could see from our fleet productivity, we still have some extra capacity to absorb. But when we get into the peak seasons, starting Q2 and Q3, that's where we typically spend 75% to 80% of our CapEx in the year. 
It's also important to note that we plan on selling $1.7 billion worth of fleets in '21 because of the robustness of the end market, and that's a great way to not only take care of our customers that want to buy fleet but refresh our feet. So when you -- inflation adjust that, that's $1.95 billion of replacement capital. So depending on where we end up in the range, you have anywhere from $50 million to $350 million of growth capital. And we'll meter it in as we earn it, as we absorb it and we see the opportunity."

So all end markets have the opportunity geographically, But it's just thinking about things that are struggling, like as you could imagine, anything travel-related, anything entertainment-related lodging. I'm certainly not expecting us to be on any hotel projects as we get through '21. 
And then even retail, right? So we're a little worried about retail. But on the flip side of that, when we get back to the winners, distribution and warehousing and logistics are hot right now because that's how consumers buying products. So that's just an example of where we can move our fleet out of what might be retail growth and into warehouse and distribution growth. And this is the flexibility of the model with a very fungible assets. So geographically broad, and I think we could all talk to the markets that are winning and losing.

We'll still have negative fleet productivity here in Q1. We've already told you guys about the tough comps. So think about that in a high single-digit range tough comp in Q1. And what that portends then once we get past the comp in Q2, you model that against our midpoint of 3.5% and you see some significant growth. And that will play through fleet productivity similarly. So we think that, that all portends to great opportunity and absorption remains our opportunity. Once we do that, we'll start to meter in the growth CapEx, as I had said earlier.
As far as mix, mix is an output, right, to what the customers end up renting from us. To your point, we could have more broad usage in petrochem if that comes back than maybe we had this year, and that could help.

The reason that's very important is because I've been doing this 30 years. I will promise you there's no contractor that's going to buy a pit equipment to sit in the art. So it underlies what we're seeing in our customer confidence index, what we're hearing from our teams that our customers are going to have work.
So that's first and foremost. I think what we've done that's unique is we've built that retail sales engine direct to customers versus relying on trades or auctions, and that's really benefited us. We are pleasantly surprised as well. As far as the viability of it, well, if it just grew this year. The back half of this year was 35% over a very robust 19. I don't see how it would continue on as activity picks up as demand overall picks up. So we feel good about the resiliency there.
And it's a great way to refresh the fleet. The repositioning I mean, we'll -- it's what we do. We manage the business. It's part of the advantage of having a very broad end market we serve in a very broad geography. So we don't have to move because our network is so dense. We don't have to move equipment across the country. So the repositioning, it happens on a daily basis. And it's really just moving it to where the customer needs.

If I think about flow-through at the midpoint for guidance, it is 31.5%. We -- the one of the biggest costs that will reset in the business in 2021 are our bonuses. And that is going to be about a $50 million headwind at Target, and that translates into about 50 basis points of margin. So absent that bonus reset margins at the midpoint year-over-year would actually be flat. 
And then from a closing perspective, if I adjust for that same $50 million, it's a flow-through ex-bonus of about 50%. So that's the largest one factor I would point out. The other factor I'd point out is the resetting of some of the other costs. So we mentioned T&E, I would also say some of the variable costs that will flex with the increase in the activity and just getting the business back to a normal flow of operating costs that's also built into the guidance and the flow-through that you see.

Thanks for joining us. As we look back on the past year, I feel that 2020 was a proven ground for our company. It gave us the opportunity to prove the resiliency of our business model and the disciplines",1247,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
As we look back on the past year, I feel that 2020 was a proven ground for our company. It gave us the opportunity to prove the resiliency of our business model and the disciplines we've engineered for more than a decade: things like capital management, cost management, operational agility and the willingness of our team to embrace change. We've demonstrated these capabilities during choppy periods in the past, but last year wasn't just a downturn, it was a sharp and significant economic disruption. And we stood up to those conditions while keeping our people safe, streamlining our operating costs, aggressively flexing our CapEx and managing our excess capital to reduce leverage.  In addition, we kept our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to within 50 basis points of 2019, despite significantly lower market demand, and we generated record free cash flow. 
And now, things are getting better. Most of our end markets have been on a steady path to recovery since the third quarter, and we saw that continue in Q4.  These factors help us narrow the gap in rental revenue year-over-year from being down over 13% in Q3 to down just 10% in Q4. And as you saw yesterday, our fourth quarter results were better than our guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
I was also pleased that throughout 2020, we stayed laser-focused on execution, while remaining flexible and agile in a very fluid environment. And most importantly, we never wavered from our fierce determination to take great care of our employees and our customers. 
We didn't resort to reactive cuts in our service capacity that would harm our customer service or slow us down in the upcycle or impact our long-term earnings power. Early on, we committed to keeping the key in the ignition on capacity so we could start the engine up at any time. And as we enter '21, this has proven to be the right decision. 
The execution of that decision rests squarely with our people, and they have consistently delivered. They're the reason why our safety reportable rate remained below 1 for all 4 quarters of 2020. And it's a credit to their professionalism that our COVID protocols were adopted so quickly company-wide, allowing us to serve our customers safely.  And the financial results you saw yesterday were generated by the talent and commitment of our people all working together as one UR. It's an exceptional team, and I'm very proud to work beside them. 
Now let's look forward to the current year. 
COVID isn't a traditional cycle, but it's a cycle nonetheless. And we believe it will continue to have an impact for the foreseeable future. As our guidance indicates, we'll continue to gain ground in '21 as we work our way back towards pre-COVID levels.  Our sentiment echos the majority of our customers in our recent surveys, the comments we hear from the field and other external data points we've collected. We're optimistic of the year, while being realistic that visibility is still somewhat limited.  
What our guidance doesn't show is the cadence of demand this year. But once we lapped the first quarter, our toughest comp will be behind us, and then we expect to return to growth as we move through '21.  And we base this on a couple of factors. 
The recent spike in COVID cases is projected to settle down in the coming months, which should help reactivate some projects that were temporarily halted. And as the vaccines are rolled out, business confidence should continue to improve. And this will provide a tailwind for both capital projects and MRO spending. And as demand trends up, we're well positioned to be first call for our customers. 
And before I get into our operating environment, I want to mention our fourth quarter revenue from used equipment sales. It was $275 million, almost 13% higher than prior year, and it was driven by healthy retail demand. And as you know, we look at the strength of the used equipment market as a key indicator for the rental industry. And when the retail market is favorable, it tells us that contractors are projecting needs for that fleet. 
Another positive indicator is that our industry overall showed great discipline on the supply side in 2020, and this is a good place to be as activity ramps up. 
Looking at our operating environment, there are some encouraging signs. The verticals we called out as most resilient on our last call are continuing to lead project activity in markets like power, health care, distribution and technology. Within these verticals, we're looking at a range of jobs, including data centers, hospitals, warehouses and even power plants. 
And on the other side of the ledger, petrochem continued to be soft in the fourth quarter. The good news is that we're seeing light at the end of the COVID tunnel, and we expect this sector to do better this year led by scheduled turnaround activity in downstream and chemical process. 
Within non-res, which is our largest revenue base, a number of new projects broke put ground in the fourth quarter and others plan to start up this year. These include some big stadium projects that were postponed when COVID hit.  And the same is true of airport construction and renovation. We see a number of these multiyear projects back on the table. And to a lesser degree, road and bridge work, which generally has remained steady.  
Infrastructure has been topical since the election. And while the details and the timing are unknown at this point, President Biden has been clear that this will be a priority for his administration. And as the economy continues to heal, United Rentals is in a strong position to benefit from any increase in end market spending, including infrastructure. And we've invested for years in positioning the company for this type of scenario. 
Our specialty segment had another good quarter, led by our power and HVAC business, which generated fourth quarter same-store revenue that was higher than the prior year. It underscores the importance of our ongoing investments in specialty operations. In total, we plan to open another 30 specialty cold starts this year, which is double the number that we opened last year. And this will bring us close to 400 specialty locations by December. 
Here's the main point of my comments this morning. You may recall our mantra that figure doesn't really matter unless we're constantly driving for better. And the way we get there is by doing what we say we're going to do. 2020 did its best to challenges on that, but we came through for all of our stakeholders, and the learnings we gained from that experience have been incorporated into our operations. And we'll leverage these learnings as we return to growth. 
Finally, we said we would fulfill our responsibility to investors by protecting the long-term earnings power of the business, and we're doing that, too. The takeaway from 2020 isn't what went wrong in the external environment, it's what went right when we committed to a course of action and met our goals. Yesterday, you saw the results of that commitment. And today, we're telling you that we intend to deliver again in '21. 
So I'll stop here and ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. So Jess, over to you."

Our financial results in the fourth quarter were better than we expected, with rental volumes continuing to recover and strong used sales activity at retail, and more on both in a minute.  Costs were in line and supported by -- supported solid margins in the quarter. Free cash flow for the year also exceeded expectations, and our leverage at year-end was down versus 2019. That's all good news as we move into 2021. 
I'll provide some color on our '21 guidance before we get to Q&A. Let's start now with the results for the quarter. 
Rental revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.85 billion, which was lower by $208 million or 10.1% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER decreased $190 million or 10.9%. In that, a 5.6% decline in the average size of the fleet was a $98 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $25 million, and fleet productivity was down 3.8% or a $67 million impact.  Sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 420 basis points, mainly from better fleet absorption. Rounding out the decline in rental revenue for the quarter was $18 million in lower ancillary and re-rent revenues. 
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger-than-expected in the quarter, coming in at $275 million. That's an increase of $31 million or about 13% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by an increase in retail sales. That reflected OEC sold up 35% year-over-year in the retail channel for the second quarter in a row. 
Used margins in the quarter were solid at 42.5%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at just shy of 50% of original cost. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $1.04 billion, a decline of $117 million or 10.1% year-over-year. The dollar change includes a $143 million headwind from rental. And in that, OER made up $140 million and ancillary and re-rent together were the remaining $3 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $11 million, which offset a $3 million headwind from our other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was another benefit in the quarter of $18 million, with the majority of that help coming from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 45.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year, and flow-through as reported was about 66%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, used sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a headwind to margin and flow-through. 
Second, I mentioned on our Q3 call, back in October, that we had a benefit in bonus expense in Q4 2019 that would cause a drag this Q4. Adjusting for those 2 items implies a margin of 46.1% and flow-through for the quarter of just over 56%. Both results were largely as expected and pointed to continuing cost discipline even as certain operating costs started to normalize. 
A quick comment on adjusted EPS, which was $5.04 That compares with $5.60 in Q4 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower net income from lower revenue. 
Let's move to CapEx. For the quarter, rental CapEx was $176 million, bringing our full year spend to $961 million in gross rental CapEx, which was 55% less than what we spent in 2019. Proceeds in 2020 from used equipment sales were $858 million, resulting in net CapEx of $103 million. 
ROIC remained strong at year-end, coming in at 8.9%. That continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital, which currently runs about 7%. Year-over-year, ROIC was lower by 150 basis points, primarily due to the decline in revenue.  
Turning to free cash flow, which was a record for us at over $2.4 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of over $860 million versus 2019. As we look at the balance sheet, our having dedicated the majority of our free cash flow to debt reduction in 2020 resulted in a $1.9 billion or almost 17% decrease year-over-year in net debt. Leverage was 2.4x at year-end, down from 2.6x at the end of 2019. 
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished 2020 with just under $3.1 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.7 billion and availability on our AR facility of $166 million. We also had $202 million in cash. 
Let's shift to our 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. Our view to total revenue includes a return to growth in rental revenue with the season, starting in April. We look forward to getting past the challenging comp in Q1 as we lapped the start of the pandemic and move to delivering rental growth for the rest of the year. Our guidance includes a range of outcomes given our seasonal patterns and assumptions we've made on the pace of continuing recovery across our end markets. We're planning for another strong year in used sales, and we'll look to increase our CapEx spend to replace that fleet. 
Within our guidance, that reflects over $1.9 billion in replacement CapEx. Beyond that, we continue to be focused on absorbing the fleet we own, and we'll adjust our growth capital accordingly with total spend planned at pre-COVID levels. 
Our range on adjusted EBITDA considers not only the volume growth we expect in revenue, but also our continuing to manage costs tightly. We'll leverage what we've learned in 2020 using our own capacity to support our customers with less reliance on third-parties. As our business continues to recover, we'll also see a reset of costs that ran low in 2020, such as T&E and bonuses. 
Finally, one of the best indicators of the strength of our business model is the resiliency of our cash flow, especially as we invest behind growth. In 2021, we expect another year of generating significant free cash flow, and that's after considering a return to over $2 billion in CapEx spending. We'll continue to use our free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce our leverage.

We actually see the market in balance almost all the way there already, which is really exciting. When I think about how the industry has responded to this downturn, specifically compared to the '09 downturn, which was quite a different scenario, the route data tells us that we're almost in balance already from a days in fleet, days on rent.  
We're not quite there yet, but a heck a lot closer than I would have thought. So I think we're already in pretty good shape. And now it's just about the opportunities that we can lean into. And we do see growth headroom over the next few years. 
This year may be a little less than what we'll see in the future years, but I'll also say that this headline growth that -- let's use the midpoint of 3.5% is a little bit misleading because it's having to absorb what is a tough comp in Q1. And when you model that out, you see the quarters 2 through 4 are actually significantly higher than the 3.5% average you see.

There's a couple of things I'd point to. First of all, within non-res, there are certainly winners and losers. And the ability we have to -- and we're planning for this, to outpace the end market growth is by using those fungible assets and moving them from the weaker market to the stronger markets. So that's always been our mantra. And I'd say the rental industry overall usually has the opportunity and the ability to outpace the end market growth. And you'd see that historically. 
I would also say that in the industrial side, although there's still some negatives, and I pointed to oil and gas, they're off a pretty deep floor right now, and we see there could be some opportunity in specifically downstream and chemical processing.

As you could see from our fleet productivity, we still have some extra capacity to absorb. But when we get into the peak seasons, starting Q2 and Q3, that's where we typically spend 75% to 80% of our CapEx in the year.  
It's also important to note that we plan on selling $1.7 billion worth of fleets in '21 because of the robustness of the end market, and that's a great way to not only take care of our customers that want to buy fleet, but refresh our feet. So when you inflation adjust that, that's $1.95 billion of replacement capital. So depending on where we end up in the range, you have anywhere from $50 million to $350 million of growth capital.

And then I guess part 2 is just that how rate and mix would potentially interact should we see a backdrop in which your industrial markets grow faster than construction. And maybe that's a wrong assumption, but just again, I really -- the question -- the spirit of the question is kind of that rate mix dynamic in an environment where oil and gas maybe isn't shrinking and you get some pickup in those larger industrial end markets?

And that's the main driver. It was the driver in our sequential improvement Q3 to Q4. And it's what's going to turn us positive by second quarter next year. We'll still have negative fleet productivity here in Q1. We've already told you guys about the tough comps. So think about that in a high-single-digit range tough comp in Q1. And what that portends then once we get past the comp in Q2. You model that against our midpoint of 3.5% and you see some significant growth. And that will play through fleet productivity similarly. So we think that, that all portends to great opportunity and absorption remains our opportunity. Once we do that, we'll start to meter in the growth CapEx, as I had said earlier. 
As far as mix, mix is an output, right, to what the customers end up renting from us. To your point, we could have more broad usage in petrochem if that comes back than maybe we had this year, and that could help. But the interplay of mix and rate is more of an output of what products you rent than really a designed outcome, which is why we don't forecast."

So first off, on the the retail, admittedly, it surpassed our expectations, but on new sales -- and it was driven by retail. And the reason that is very important, is because I've been doing this 30 years, I will promise you there's no contractor that's going to buy a piece of equipment to sit in the dark. So it underlies what we're seeing in our customer confidence index, what we're hearing from our teams, that our customers are going to have work.  So that's first and foremost. 
I think what we've done that's unique is we've built that retail sales engine direct to customers versus relying on trades or auctions, and that's really benefited us. We are pleasantly surprised as well. As far as the viability of it, well, if it just grew this year, the back half of this year was 35% over a very robust '19, I don't see how it would continue on as activity picks up, as demand overall picks up. So we feel good about the resiliency there.  And it's a great way to refresh the fleet. 
The repositioning I mean, we'll -- it's what we do. We manage the business. It's part of the advantage of having a very broad end market we serve in a very broad geography. So we don't have to move because our network is so dense. We don't have to move equipment across the country. So the repositioning, it happens on a daily basis. And it's really just moving it to where the customer needs. And it's not something that we're pulling out any exceptional costs or anything like that for."

I'll actually use the midpoint even though I usually -- my standard is not to anchor to the midpoint. I'll use the midpoint right now just to walk through.
If I think about flow-through at the midpoint for guidance, it is 31.5%. We -- the biggest costs that will reset in the business in 2021 are our bonuses. And that is going to be about a $50 million headwind at target, and that translates into about 50 basis points of margin. So absent that bonus reset margins at the midpoint year-over-year would actually be flat.  And then from a closing perspective, if I adjust for that same $50 million, it's a flow-through ex-bonus of about 50%.  So that's the largest one factor I would point out. 
The other factor I'd point out is the resetting of some of the other costs. So we mentioned T&E. I would also say some of the variable costs that will flex with the increase in the activity and just getting the business back to a normal flow of operating costs that's also built into the guidance and the flow-through that you see. We haven't quantified or really identified beyond some of the obvious ones, right, like T&E, some of our professional fees, we haven't quantified what that looks like. We've built into our range expectations of some of those costs coming back at a slightly higher pace than the overall revenue growth in the year."

As you saw yesterday, we reported a really strong performance out of the gate in '21 in what's shaping up to be a great year. We knew we had built good momentum in Q4 and that the economy was moving in the right direction. But the first quarter was still uncertain as we entered the year. 
Well not anymore, both our operating conditions and our performance have improved faster than we expected. We gained back a lot of the ground on rental revenue narrowing the decline from 2020. And importantly, we exited the quarter up year-over-year in March. Our customers are also optimistic. They're gaining more visibility and they're turning to us for the equipment they need. 
Just a few months into the year, we've absorbed almost all of the excess fleet we had in 2020. This was evident in the sequential improvement in our fleet productivity that we reported. And we took advantage of a healthy used equipment market, driving record retail sales to generate almost 30% more proceeds in the quarter than we did a year ago. 
None of this would be possible without our greatest asset. Our employees and their willingness to take on the challenges as well as the opportunities presented to them. I want people know how much I respect them for their commitment, and our customers feel the same way. And I'm proud to report that Team United delivered $873 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, and they did it safely, turning in another quarterly recordable rate below 1. And given all these factors, we feel confident in raising guidance across the board. This includes a new revenue range that starts above the top end of the previous guidance. 
We feel equally comfortable leaning into M&A, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Franklin Equipment and our agreement to acquire General Finance, which we expect to close midyear. We feel the time is right to allocate capital to attractive deals like these that meet our M&A criteria for a strong strategic, financial and cultural fit. 
With Franklin, we added 20 stores to our general rental footprint in the Central and Southeast regions. And the Franklin team is already on board, and I'll take this opportunity to officially welcome them to Team United. 
General Finance is a market leader in mobile storage and modular office rentals. And these services complement our current specialty and general offerings, and we're excited about the opportunity to unlock additional growth while sale in more of our customers' needs with these new products. We'll be entering these markets with a strong presence and established footprint and a talented team with solid customer relationships, many of them new to our company. It's a textbook example of 1 plus 1 equaling more than 2. If you weren't able to join our earlier call on General Finance, we'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. Now let's pivot to demand, where we have more good news to share. 
The rebound we're seeing in our end markets is broadly positive. And this is true of our general rental business and even more so in our Specialty segment. Specialty had another robust performance led by our power and HVAC business. Rental revenue for Specialty moved past the inflection point and was positive year-over-year for the full quarter. And we're continuing to invest in growing our Specialty network with 6 cold starts year-to-date and another 24 planned this year. 
Now I'll drill down to our customers and our end markets. Customer sentiment continues to trend up in our surveys as the majority of our customers expect to see growth over the next 12 months. And importantly, the percent of customers who feel this way has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels. And we think there are a few reasons for this. For one thing, our customers have a significant amount of work in hand, and they can also see that our project activity is continuing to recover. The vaccines are rolling out, restrictions are easing in most markets and the weather is turning warmer, 3 positive dynamics converging right before our busy season. 
Also, we're seeing the return of activity in the manufacturing sector after more than a year of industrial recession. And the construction verticals that have been most resilient throughout COVID are still going strong, areas that we've discussed like technology and data centers, power, health care and warehousing and distribution. And with infrastructure, our customers are encouraged that it's back on the table in Washington. Most of the infrastructure categories and the administration's current proposal are directly in our wheelhouse, things like bridges, airport and clean energy. And we'll see how the process goes, but almost any infrastructure spending will benefit us in the long term, both directly and indirectly. 
Now there are some markets that are taking longer to recover, like energy. Most parts of the energy complex, including downstream, remains sluggish. And additionally, retail, office and lodging are largely in limbo. So while we're firing on all cylinders at United, there are pockets of the economy that are still catching up and this means more opportunity for us down the road. 
I'll sum up my comments with this perspective. 2021 is shaping up to be a promising year. And our performance says a lot about our willingness to lean into that promise, whether it's with CapEx, M&A, cold starts or other strategic investments in the business. Our balance sheet and cash flow give us the ability to keep every option on the table. Throughout last year, we made the decision to retain capacity by keeping our branch network and our team intact. And now that the economic indicators are flashing green, our strategy is paying off by driving value for our people, our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. Over to you, Jess."

The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track.

The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track. That strength carries through to our revised guidance and more on that in a few minutes. Let's start now with the results for the first quarter. 
Rental revenue for the first quarter was $1.67 billion, which was lower by $116 million or 6.5% year-over-year. And within rental revenue, OER decreased $117 million or 7.7%. In that, a 5.7% decline in the average size of the fleet was an $87 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $24 million, and fleet productivity was down 50 basis points or a $6 million impact sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 330 basis points, recovering a bit faster than we expected. Finishing the bridge on rental revenue this quarter is $1 million in higher ancillary and re-rent revenues. 
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger than expected in the quarter, coming in at $267 million. That's an increase of $59 million or about 28% year-over-year, led by a 49% increase in retail sales. The end market for used equipment remains strong. And while pricing was down year-over-year, it's up for the second straight quarter with margins solid at almost 43%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at around half its original cost. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $873 million, a decline of $42 million or 4.6% year-over-year. The dollar change includes an $84 million decrease from rental. In that, OER was down $86 million, while ancillary and re-rent together were an offset of $2 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, which offset a $2 million headwind from other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was a benefit in the quarter of $25 million. Similar to the last couple of quarters, the majority of that SG&A benefit came from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 42.4%, down 70 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was about 62%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, as I mentioned in our January call, we'll have a drag in bonus expense during 2021 as we reset to our planned target. That reset started in the first quarter. Second, use sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a revenue mix headwind. Adjusting for those 2 results is an implied decremental flow-through for the quarter of about 37%. Across the core business, the first quarter's cost performance played out as we expected and reflects our continued discipline as we respond to increasing demand and as our costs continue to normalize. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $3.45. That's up $0.10 versus Q1 last year, primarily on lower interest expense and a lower share count. Quick note on CapEx. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $295 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $267 million, resulting in net CapEx in Q1 of $28 million. 
Now turning to ROIC, which remains strong at 8.9%. As we look back over what's obviously been a challenging 12 months, one of the things that we're most pleased with is the ROIC we've generated, which has consistently run above our weighted average cost of capital through what was the trough of the down cycle. 
Free cash flow was also strong at $725 million for the quarter. This represents an increase of $119 million versus the first quarter of 2020 or about a 20% increase. As we look at the balance sheet, net debt is down 21% year-over-year, without having reduced our balance by about $2.3 billion over those 12 months. Leverage continues to move down and was 2.3x at the end of the first quarter. That compares with 2.5x at the end of the first quarter last year. 
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished the quarter with over $3.7 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $3.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $276 million. We also had $278 million in cash. And since Matt mentioned our acquisitions earlier, I'll take a second here to note that we expect to fund the General Finance deal later this quarter with the ABL. 
Let's shift to our revised 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. This update does not include any impact from General Finance. If we close as expected in June, we'll update our guidance likely on our Q2 call in July to reflect the impact of that business. 
What is included in this update is mainly 3 things. First, the impact of higher rental revenue. Second, increased used sales capitalizing on a stronger-than-expected retail market. And third, the contribution of our Franklin Equipment acquisition, which we estimate at about $90 million of revenue and $30 million of adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year. 
We revised our current view to rental revenue given the start to the year and how we expect things to play out from here. The increase in our guidance reflects a range of possibilities with a growth opportunity over the remainder of the year largely follows normal seasonality, albeit from a higher starting point. And as you can see at midpoint, our updated guidance implies strong double-digit growth over the remaining 9 months of the year. 
A quick note on the guidance change in EBITDA and what hasn't changed in this revision, which is our continuing to manage costs tightly even as activity ramps more than forecasted. Our revised range on adjusted EBITDA considers that cost performance across the core business and reflects the impact of higher used sales and the Franklin acquisition, with margins and flow-through in line with our prior guidance. 
As certain of our costs continue to normalize from low levels in 2020, bonus expense remains the headwind we've discussed previously, and at midpoint is about a 60 basis point drag in margin year-over-year. Finally, the increase in free cash flow reflects the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned and remains robust at a midpoint of $1.8 billion. Now let's get to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

So we think that's encouraging on 2 fronts. Number one, we want to be a one-stop shop for them.

And as far as customers being able to fill their own capital demands, I'm not really hearing that as a priority right now. It is early in the season. But I will say, if there's one area where the supply chain could impact, it would be on new sales, which is, by definition, a spot sale, a spot deal, right?

But as it's kind of in your markets and in your -- kind of what's in front of you, I mean the magnitude of some of these increases is pretty pronounced. And so I guess the question is a bit twofold. One is, if you look at the inflation that's hitting your customer base is at large and you kind of look at the CPI, so the prices they're selling relative to their PPI, that's been -- it's out of balance. So I'm trying to think how you -- how does that -- in the interplay with that with rental rates. And again, I know that's kind of -- we're not asking specifically about your rental rates. But I'm saying just in general, does this -- does a more inflationary backdrop help or hurt the opportunity from an industry, not United, but from an industry standpoint, from the standpoint of rental rates? 
And then more specific to your P&L. And I'm not asking about equipment inflation. I'm asking about inflationary pressures within -- just within cost of rent. What kind of pressure points are there? Obviously, labor is a big one, and you guys historically have managed that well.

From a customer's perspective, and you kind of tied it to rate, so I'll do my replacement of fleet productivity.

We understand in any environment, our job and what we pay our managers to do out in the field is to make sure we can outpace inflation. It's natural in every business. And what could be an accelerated inflationary period looking forward for a bit, we'll see how that manifests. That would just up that need. And certainly, with all components of fleet productivity would be leaned upon to help drive that. And inflationary costs will be being absorbed by our customers. So they'll understand the dynamic. 
I think as far as what it does for the industry, when you think about cost of capital inflation, now that could drive some secular penetration for rental overall as an industry. We'd see that as a positive. People would -- it would just make what we think already pencils very well for a favorable look to rent versus own. It would even drive that gap and that help that we can give people even more so. So I'd say that would be a benefit for the industry.

So if I then shift to the cost side of it, as you mentioned, labor for sure is a consideration. And we talk -- we've talked a lot about the merit increases that we do in the normal course across our business as one component of our contracts with our employees in addition to lots of other things like training and benefits and other support. And managing through merit increases and other inflationary costs that we would have by looking for offsets within efficiencies and productivities, whether it's leveraging our scale to tighten up on cost within the branch network, not unlike we've talked about in leaning more so on in-sourcing than the premium cost in outsourcing, things like delivery and repair. But also just working through the P&L on smarter ways that we can drive better efficiency in things like facility costs and utilities and things like that.

Now some of this was, let's say, where we're getting the comps into Q2 and Q3, where we had unnaturally low cost, where we're in like a shutdown mode, we won't go quite that far, but the learning of in-sourcing. And one of the ways we were able to retain the capacity we had on our team was to insource a lot of the work that we were outsourcing previously, both in R&M, in third-party delivery, longer haul transport for transfers. Those are learnings that I think we may be able to be more efficient longer term as the business gets back to operating at full capacity. 
And then unnecessary travel. I don't want us to go as far as nobody travels. I want us to get back to not just the team building, but getting back in front of our customers and building those relationships and selling the value in person. But we certainly have a lot of learnings that not only is -- that COVID taught us from a cost perspective, but also from a time management perspective, from an efficiency perspective.

Thanks for joining us today. As you saw yesterday, we reported a really strong performance out of the gate in '21 in what's shaping up to be a great year.

As you saw yesterday, we reported a really strong performance out of the gate in '21 in what's shaping up to be a great year. We knew we had built good momentum in Q4 and that the economy was moving in the right direction. But the first quarter was still uncertain as we entered the year. 
Well not anymore, both our operating conditions and our performance have improved faster than we expected. We gained back a lot of the ground on rental revenue, narrowing the decline from 2020. And importantly, we exited the quarter up year-over-year in March. Our customers are also optimistic. They're gaining more visibility and they're turning to us for the equipment they need. 
Just a few months into the year, we've absorbed almost all of the excess fleet we had in 2020. This was evident in the sequential improvement in our fleet productivity that we reported. And we took advantage of a healthy used equipment market, driving record retail sales to generate almost 30% more proceeds in the quarter than we did a year ago. 
None of this would be possible without our greatest asset, our employees and their willingness to take on the challenges as well as the opportunities presented to them. I want people know how much I respect them for their commitment, and our customers feel the same way. And I'm proud to report that Team United delivered $873 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, and they did it safely, turning in another quarterly recordable rate below 1. And given all these factors, we feel confident in raising guidance across the board. This includes a new revenue range that starts above the top end of the previous guidance. 
We feel equally comfortable leaning into M&A, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Franklin Equipment and our agreement to acquire General Finance, which we expect to close midyear. We feel the time is right to allocate capital to attractive deals like these that meet our M&A criteria for a strong strategic, financial and cultural fit. 
With Franklin, we added 20 stores to our general rental footprint in the Central and Southeast regions. And the Franklin team is already on board, and I'll take this opportunity to officially welcome them to Team United. 
General Finance is a market leader in mobile storage and modular office rentals. And these services complement our current specialty and general offerings, and we're excited about the opportunity to unlock additional growth while showing more of our customers' needs with these new products. We'll be entering these markets with a strong presence and established footprint and a talented team with solid customer relationships, many of them new to our company. It's a textbook example of 1 plus 1 equaling more than 2. If you weren't able to join our earlier call on General Finance, we'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. 
Now let's pivot to demand, where we have more good news to share. The rebound we're seeing in our end markets is broadly positive. And this is true of our general rental business and even more so in our specialty segment. Specialty had another robust performance led by our power and HVAC business. Rental revenue for specialty moved past the inflection point and was positive year-over-year for the full quarter. And we're continuing to invest in growing our Specialty network with 6 cold starts year-to-date and another 24 planned this year. 
Now I'll drill down to our customers and our end markets. Customer sentiment continues to trend up in our surveys as the majority of our customers expect to see growth over the next 12 months. And importantly, the percent of customers who feel this way has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels. And we think there are a few reasons for this. For one thing, our customers have a significant amount of work in hand, and they can also see that our project activity is continuing to recover. The vaccines are rolling out, restrictions are easing in most markets and the weather is turning warmer, 3 positive dynamics converging right before our busy season. 
Also, we're seeing the return of activity in the manufacturing sector after more than a year of industrial recession. And the construction verticals that have been most resilient throughout COVID are still going strong, areas that we've discussed like technology and data centers, power, health care and warehousing and distribution. And with infrastructure, our customers are encouraged that it's back on the table in Washington. Most of the infrastructure categories and the administration's current proposal are directly in our wheelhouse, things like bridges, airport and clean energy. And we'll see how the process goes, but almost any infrastructure spending will benefit us in the long term, both directly and indirectly. 
Now there are some markets that are taking longer to recover, like energy. Most parts of the energy complex, including downstream, remains sluggish. And additionally, retail, office and lodging are largely in limbo. So while we're firing on all cylinders at United, there are pockets of the economy that are still catching up, and this means more opportunity for us down the road. 
I'll sum up my comments with this perspective. 2021 is shaping up to be a promising year. And our performance says a lot about our willingness to lean into that promise, whether it's with CapEx, M&A, cold starts or other strategic investments in the business. Our balance sheet and cash flow give us the ability to keep every option on the table. Throughout last year, we made the decision to retain capacity by keeping our branch network and our team intact. And now that the economic indicators are flashing green, our strategy is paying off by driving value for our people, our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. Over to you, Jess."

The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track. That strength carries through to our revised guidance and more",1064,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track. That strength carries through to our revised guidance and more on that in a few minutes. But let's start now with the results for the first quarter. 
Rental revenue for the first quarter was $1.67 billion, which was lower by $116 million or 6.5% year-over-year. And within rental revenue, OER decreased $117 million or 7.7%. In that, a 5.7% decline in the average size of the fleet was an $87 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $24 million, and fleet productivity was down 50 basis points or a $6 million impact. Sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 330 basis points, recovering a bit faster than we expected. Finishing the bridge on rental revenue this quarter is $1 million in higher ancillary and re-rent revenues. 
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger than expected in the quarter, coming in at $267 million. That's an increase of $59 million or about 28% year-over-year, led by a 49% increase in retail sales. The end market for used equipment remains strong. And while pricing was down year-over-year, it's up for the second straight quarter with margins solid at almost 43%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at around half its original cost. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $873 million, a decline of $42 million or 4.6% year-over-year. The dollar change includes an $84 million decrease from rental. In that, OER was down $86 million, while ancillary and re-rent together were an offset of $2 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, which offset a $2 million headwind from other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was a benefit in the quarter of $25 million. Similar to the last couple of quarters, the majority of that SG&A benefit came from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 42.4%, down 70 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was about 62%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, as I mentioned in our January call, we'll have a drag in bonus expense during 2021 as we reset to our planned target. That reset started in the first quarter. Second, use sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a revenue mix headwind. Adjusting for those 2 results is an implied decremental flow-through for the quarter of about 37%. Across the core business, the first quarter's cost performance played out as we expected and reflects our continued discipline as we respond to increasing demand and as our costs continue to normalize. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $3.45. That's up $0.10 versus Q1 last year, primarily on lower interest expense and a lower share count. Quick note on CapEx. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $295 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $267 million, resulting in net CapEx in Q1 of $28 million. 
Now turning to ROIC, which remains strong at 8.9%. As we look back over what's obviously been a challenging 12 months, one of the things that we're most pleased with is the ROIC we've generated, which has consistently run above our weighted average cost of capital through what was the trough of the down cycle. 
Free cash flow was also strong at $725 million for the quarter. This represents an increase of $119 million versus the first quarter of 2020 or about a 20% increase. As we look at the balance sheet, net debt is down 21% year-over-year, without having reduced our balance by about $2.3 billion over those 12 months. Leverage continues to move down and was 2.3x at the end of the first quarter. That compares with 2.5x at the end of the first quarter last year. 
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished the quarter with over $3.7 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $3.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $276 million. We also had $278 million in cash. And since Matt mentioned our acquisitions earlier, I'll take a second here to note that we expect to fund the General Finance deal later this quarter with the ABL. 
Let's shift to our revised 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. This update does not include any impact from General Finance. If we close as expected in June, we'll update our guidance likely on our Q2 call in July to reflect the impact of that business. 
What is included in this update is mainly 3 things. First, the impact of higher rental revenue. Second, increased used sales capitalizing on a stronger-than-expected retail market. And third, the contribution of our Franklin Equipment acquisition, which we estimate at about $90 million of revenue and $30 million of adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year. 
We revised our current view to rental revenue given the start to the year and how we expect things to play out from here. The increase in our guidance reflects a range of possibilities with a growth opportunity over the remainder of the year largely follows normal seasonality, albeit from a higher starting point. And as you can see at midpoint, our updated guidance implies strong double-digit growth over the remaining 9 months of the year. 
A quick note on the guidance change in EBITDA and what hasn't changed in this revision, which is our continuing to manage costs tightly even as activity ramps more than forecasted. Our revised range on adjusted EBITDA considers that cost performance across the core business and reflects the impact of higher used sales and the Franklin acquisition, with margins and flow-through in line with our prior guidance. 
As certain of our costs continue to normalize from low levels in 2020, bonus expense remains the headwind we've discussed previously, and at midpoint is about a 60 basis point drag in margin year-over-year. Finally, the increase in free cash flow reflects the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned and remains robust at a midpoint of $1.8 billion.

This was -- or certainly not auctions, not a channel that we usually participate in. But this is selling to end users, customers and supporting their needs. So we think that's encouraging on 2 fronts. Number one, we want to be a one-stop shop for them. But more importantly, it means that they feel good about the amount of work they have coming forward, which is why they're buying used equipment. So Q1 was really a great start out of the gates.

And as far as customers being able to fill their own capital demands, I'm not really hearing that as a priority right now. It is early in the season. But I will say, if there's one area where the supply chain could impact, it would be on new sales, which is, by definition, a spot sale, a spot deal, right?

But as it's kind of in your markets and in your -- kind of what's in front of you, I mean the magnitude of some of these increases is pretty pronounced. And so I guess the question is a bit twofold. One is, if you look at the inflation that's hitting your customer base is at large and you kind of look at the CPI, so the prices they're selling relative to their PPI, that's been -- it's out of balance. So I'm trying to think how you -- how does that -- in the interplay with that with rental rates. And again, I know that's kind of -- we're not asking specifically about your rental rates. But I'm saying just in general, does this -- does a more inflationary backdrop help or hurt the opportunity from an industry, not United, but from an industry standpoint, from the standpoint of rental rates? 
And then more specific to your P&L. And I'm not asking about equipment inflation. I'm asking about inflationary pressures within -- just within cost of rent. What kind of pressure points are there? Obviously, labor is a big one, and you guys historically have managed that well.

And what could be an accelerated inflationary period looking forward for a bit, we'll see how that manifests. That would just up that need. And certainly, with all components of fleet productivity would be leaned upon to help drive that. And inflationary costs will be being absorbed by our customers. So they'll understand the dynamic. 
I think as far as what it does for the industry, when you think about cost of capital inflation, now that could drive some secular penetration for rental overall as an industry. We'd see that as a positive. People would -- it would just make what we think already pencils very well for a favorable look to rent versus own. It would even drive that gap and that help that we can give people even more so. So I'd say that would be a benefit for the industry.

So if I then shift to the cost side of it, as you mentioned, labor for sure is a consideration. And we've talked a lot about the merit increases that we do in the normal course across our business as one component of our contracts with our employees in addition to lots of other things like training and benefits and other support. 
And managing through merit increases and other inflationary costs that we would have by looking for offsets within efficiencies and productivities, whether it's leveraging our scale to tighten up on cost within the branch network, not unlike we've talked about in leaning more so on in-sourcing than the premium cost in outsourcing, things like delivery and repair. But also just working through the P&L on smarter ways that we can drive better efficiency in things like facility costs and utilities and things like that.

And one of the ways we were able to retain the capacity we had on our team was to insource a lot of the work that we were outsourcing previously, both in R&M, in third-party delivery, longer haul transport for transfers. Those are learnings that I think we may be able to be more efficient longer term as the business gets back to operating at full capacity. 
And then unnecessary travel. I don't want us to go as far as nobody travels. I want us to get back to not just the team building, but getting back in front of our customers and building those relationships and selling the value in person. But we certainly have a lot of learnings that not only is -- that COVID taught us from a cost perspective, but also from a time management perspective, from an efficiency perspective. That would be another one that I think will certainly stick around in a lot of industries going forward. So those are the things I'd point to."

Thanks for joining us this morning. Three months ago, we said that 2021 was shaping up to be a great year for United Rentals, and that's still very much the case. Our operating environment continues to recover.",944,"Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. 
Three months ago, we said that 2021 was shaping up to be a great year for United Rentals, and that's still very much the case. Our operating environment continues to recover. Our customers are increasingly optimistic about their prospects, and our company is continuing to lean into growth from a position of strength as a premium provider and our industry's largest one-stop shop. 
We're the supply leader in a demand environment, and we've leveraged that to deliver another consecutive quarter of strong results. 
The big themes of the second quarter are strong growth in line with our expectations and robust free cash flow, either after the step-up in our CapEx; positive industry indicators, including a strong used equipment market where pricing was up 7% year-over-year; the expansion of our go-to-market platform through M&A and cold starts. This is tied to the broad-based recovery in demand and our focus on operational discipline as we manage the increase in both volume and capacity while driving fleet productivity of nearly 18%. 
Another key takeaway is our safety performance, and I'm very proud of the team for holding the line on safety with another recordable rate below 1, while at the same time, managing a robust busy season and onboarding our acquired locations. This includes General Finance, which we acquired at the end of May. 
As you know, this was both a strategic and a financial move designed to build on our strengths. The acquisition expanded our growth capacity and gave us a leading position in the rental market for mobile storage and office solutions. The integration is going well. And while we still have more work to do, we're moving steadily through our playbook. 
As you saw in our release, we raised our outlook to include the expected impact of general finance and other M&A we closed since the first quarter. It also includes some additional investments we plan to make in CapEx that will serve us beyond 2021. This outlook follows the higher guidance we issued in April when we raised every range compared to our initial guidance. So as you can see, we're tenacious about pursuing profitable growth. And the investments we're making will still have a positive impact on our immediate performance as well as future years. 
And before Jess gets into the numbers, I want to spend a few minutes on our operating landscape. Almost all of the challenges of 2020 have righted themselves. We have a better line of sight and so do our customers. 
When we surveyed our customers at the end of June, the results showed that over 60% of our customers expect to grow their business over the coming 12 months, which is a post-pandemic high. And notably, only 3% saw a decline coming over the same period. 
Customer optimism is a great barometer. And the trends that we see in the field support their view. 
2021 is a pivotal year for us. It confirms return to growth, including our 19% rental revenue growth within the second quarter. I'll point to some of the drivers of that growth starting with geography. 
The rebound in our end markets continues to be broadly positive with all geographic regions  reporting year-over-year growth in rental revenue. Our specialty segment generated another strong performance with rental revenue topping 25% year-over-year, including same-store growth of over 19%. And importantly, we grew each major line of business by double digits, which underscores the broadness of the demand. 
For years now, our investment in building out our specialty network has been a key to our strategic positioning. These [indiscernible] differentiate our offering to customers and add resilience to our results throughout cycles. And this is true of cold starts as well as M&A. 
This year, we've opened 19 new specialty brands in the first 6 months, which puts us well on our way to our goal of 30 by year-end. We're also investing like chemical process, food and beverage, metals and mining and health care, all showing solid growth. And while the energy sector remains a laggard, it was up year-over-year for the first time in 8 quarters. 
We also have customers in verticals that are less mainstream like entertainment where demand for our equipment on movie sets and events more than doubled in the quarter. And while it's a relatively small part of the revenue. It's a good sign to see it come back. 
I also want to give you some color on project types. Cost with solid activity in heavy manufacturing, corporate campuses, schools and transmission lines. In this quarter, we're also seeing project starts in power ride test work as well as mining. These are just a few of the favorable dynamics in a very promising up cycle. And I want to put that in context. 
2020 was about the temporary loss of market opportunity, particularly in the second quarter. Now the pendulum is swinging back. And 2021 is about locking in that opportunity within the framework of our strategy. Our team is managing that extremely well. 
One proof point is our financial performance and the ways to capture growth by testing new products in the field, developing new sales pipelines and forging digital connections. Here's the thing to remember about 2021. This is still the early innings of the recovery. We're committed to capitalize on more and more demand as the opportunity unfolds, and we see a long runway ahead to drive growth, create value and deliver shareholder returns. 
Well, I'll stop here and ask Jess to go through the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Jess."

When we increased our 2021 guidance back in April, we expected a strong second quarter, supported by the momentum we were seeing to start the year. We're pleased to see that play out as anticipated with the second quarter results. And importantly, we're also pleased to see the momentum accelerate in our core business and support another raise to our guidance for the year. 
We've also added the impact from our acquisitions, notably the General Finance deal. And I'll give a little bit more color on our guidance in a few minutes, but let's start now with the results for the second quarter. 
Rental revenue for the second quarter was $1.95 billion. That's an increase of $309 million or 19%. If I exclude the impact of acquisitions on that number, rental revenue from the core business grew a healthy 16% year-over-year. 
Within rental revenue, OER increased [ to ] $231 million or 16.5%. The biggest driver in that change was fleet productivity, which was up 17.8% or $250 million. That's primarily due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes, in part as we comped the COVID impacted second quarter last year. Our average fleet size was up 0.2% or a $3 million tailwind to revenue. And rounding out OER, the inflation impact of 1.5% cost us $22 million. 
Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $65 million or 31%, and re-rent was up $13 million. And we'll talk more about the increase in ancillary revenues in a moment. 
Used equipment sales came in at $194 million. That's an increase of $18 million or about 10%. Pricing at retail in the quarter increased over 7% versus last year and supported robust adjusted used margins of 47.9%. That represents a sequential improvement of 520 basis points and is 190 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. 
Used sales proceeds for the quarter represented a strong recovery of about 59% of the original cost of fleet that was on average over 7 years old. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $999 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year or $100 million. That included $13 million of onetime costs for acquisition activity. The dollar change includes a $141 million increase from rentals. In that, OER was up $125 million. Ancillary contributed $10 million, and re-rent added $6 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, and other non-rental lines of business provided $6 million. 
The impact of SG&A and adjusted EBITDA was a headwind for the quarter of $59 million, which came mostly from the resetting of bonus expense. 
We also had higher commissions on better revenue performance and higher discretionary expenses like T&E that continue to normalize. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 43.7%, down 270 basis points year-over-year, and flow-through as reported was about 29%.  
Let's take a closer look at margin and flow-through this quarter. Importantly, you'll recall that our approved response last year included a swift and significant pullback in certain operating and discretionary costs. That was especially pronounced in the second quarter and is impacting flow-through this year as activity continues to ramp and costs continue to normalize. And we expect this will play through the rest of the year, notably in the third quarter. 
Specific to the second quarter, we've shared in previous calls that one of the costs that will reset this year is bonus expense from the low levels incurred last year. As a result, we had an expected drag in flow-through in the second quarter as we reset and now true up this year's expense. Flow-through and margins were also impacted as anticipated by acquisition activity, including the onetime costs I mentioned earlier. 
I also mentioned higher ancillary revenue in the second quarter, which represents in part the recovery of higher delivery costs. Delivery has been an area where we've seen the most inflation pressure, including higher cost for fuel and third-party hauling. And while recovering a portion of that increase in ancillary protected gross profit dollars, it impacted flow-through and margin this quarter as a pass-through. And we expect to see that play out over the next couple of quarters as well. 
Adjusting for these few items, the implied flow-through for the second quarter was about 46% with implied margins flat versus last year. With our expenses normalizing, that reflects the cost performance across the core that came in as expected. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $4.66 for the second quarter, including a $0.13 drag from onetime costs. That's up $0.98 versus last year, primarily on higher net income. 
Looking at CapEx and free cash flow. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was a robust $913 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $194 million resulting in net CapEx in the second quarter of $719 million. That's up $750 million versus the second quarter last year. Even as we've invested in significantly higher CapEx spending so far this year, our free cash flow remained very strong at just under $1.2 billion generated through June 30. 
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of CapEx. 
Our balance sheet remains rock solid. Year-over-year, net debt is down 4% or about $454 million. That's after funding over $1.4 billion of acquisition activity this year with the ABL. Leverage was 2.5x at the end of the second quarter. That's flat to where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and an increase of 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter this year, mainly due to the acquisition of General Finance in May. 
A look at our liquidity, which is very strong. We finished the quarter with over $2.8 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $2.4 billion and availability on our AR facility of $106 million. We also had $336 million in cash. 
Moving forward, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. We've raised our full year guidance ranges at the midpoint by $350 million in total revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA as we now expect stronger double-digit growth for the core business in the back half of the year. Our current guidance also includes the impact of acquisition activity since our last update, predominantly to include general finance. That increase for acquisitions reflects $250 million in total revenue and $60 million in adjusted EBITDA, which includes $15 million of expected full year onetime costs. 
Additional CapEx investment will help support higher demand. To that end, we raised our gross CapEx guidance by $300 million, a good portion of which reflects fleet we're purchasing from acne list. While the fleet will provide some contribution in 2021 and is assumed in our guidance, we expect to see the full benefit next year. 
Finally, our update of free cash flow reflects the additional CapEx we'll buy as well as the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned. It remains a robust $1.7 billion at the midpoint, and we'll continue to earmark our free cash flow this year towards debt reduction to enhance the firepower we have to grow our business.

I think investors are wondering out there about how the margins can improve from current levels over the last, say, 4 years or so. We've seen steady degradation on the rental margins. In particular, even EBITDA margins have been under a little pressure. 
I'm just trying to think through like when you think of the 5 large acquisitions you've done over the last few years, right, starting with NES and kind of running through Gen Finance of acquisition, you bought over, you say about $2.25 billion of revenues, and those EBITDA margins were only 38, right? And you used to run high 40s. So I appreciate that's a lot of revenue you bought that's dragging down the margin. 
But when I look at the business today, moving forward, how do we think about the rental margin structurally if you want to leave that all the way into EBITDA? But really, in particularly the rental margins, is this as much about just a shift towards specialty might lower margins, but improve returns on capital? Just so we can kind of level set how we should think about not just top line growth, growing earnings, but margins."

Thanks for taking a longer-term view of this because that's really how we manage and see the business. And although we have some short-term pressures when we acquire businesses that come in at lower margins, if you look over our experience of these acquired assets and what we've done with the businesses pro forma, it validates why we do M&A. We feel we can be a better owner. We could bring more value to those assets. 
If it drops EBITDA margin for a period of time, that's one metric, but we also are very focused and quite frankly, model our M&A deals on returns. So -- and our returns continue to be well above our cost of capital. 
So I don't think rental margin degradation is a concern for us. We'll continue to drive fleet productivity to overcome natural inflationary costs as well as efficiencies in our operations. And we think that's how we've taken these businesses that are in the 30s yet maintain mid-40s depending on time in the year to higher EBITDA margin, and that's what we do, right? 
So that's a great question. And I think sometimes, when people are looking at the headline, I mean that's the fact that what we've done with these businesses pro forma is driving more value."

But just to give a little bit of color behind what's implied. And I'll start with my normal call out not to enter to the midpoint here. But let me use the midpoint just to give some color behind those -- the bonus dynamic and even some of the acquisitions impact that we'll have in the back half. 
So if I use the margin at the midpoint, the back half implied margin would be down about 120 basis points for us, and that's going to generate flow through again at midpoint of about 39%. So think about margins, 46.2%. That one headwind is going to continue for us, more so in the third quarter than in the fourth as we think about the comp to last year, where the bonus was, I'll call it, abnormally low, right, lower than normal. 
So if you think about that bonus headwind as well as the anticipated headwinds in flow-through and margin that we get from the acquisition activity that margin goes from down 120 basis points to up 40 basis points or a margin implied in the back half at midpoint of 47.8% from 46.2%. Flow-through in that at the midpoint, about 50%, adjusting for those 2 items. 
So those obviously will be an impact for us. And as you mentioned, the quarterly dynamic will play out. If you just think about the comps we have against the belt tightening that we did last year, the third quarter will be -- will have more flow-through pressure than you'll see in the fourth. 
And then the other thing I just want to mention in the third quarter just to be helpful in the modeling is third quarter last year, we had $20 million of onetime benefits from insurance recoveries and absolutely not expected to repeat."

As far as fleet profile changes, I don't -- I'll hazard a guess to say 80% of the fleet that we would use to support and that we do use to support infrastructure is core fleet. So we have very fluid fleet and very fungible fleet to support this vertical.

And on the first part, on the supply side, we've got some really good partners from good suppliers out there, and I think they'll get their arms wrapped around these supply chain disruption that everybody has been dealing with in every industry. But commodities probably will rightsize a little bit as we get to the end of this year. I'm assuming that our vendors are working -- I'm not assuming. I've talked to them, working really hard to continue to improve any supply chain disruptions they had. 
So I'm not really seeing that as a barrier to us supporting our customers next year. If it is, we'll adjust. But we're not -- that's not in our calculus right now and certainly not to age the fleet."

So we understand the noise. Maybe it's our relationships, maybe it's our scale and leverage. But we've been able to exceed when we sat here in January, what we originally expected to purchase this year. 
So I think that's a good story. And I get the challenges that everybody has, but we've got what we want. Yes, there's been some slippage. And if you ask me within a quarter, if stuff come in a few weeks later, absolutely. The team worked through it. We drove higher fleet productivity on the assets that we had. And this is part of those strong supply/demand and industry dynamics that I referred to in the earlier question about fleet productivity. So nothing that's inhibited us supporting customers but something we'll continue to talk to our suppliers at how can we help them help us. And that's how we'll look at it going forward."

How much outside of your replacement of your rental used to life assets are you going to add? So 70% of the answer is there for them already, maybe more in some years, if you're not growing a lot. 
So we'll get through the planning process to see how we work through this year, but we don't see a need to actually lock in deals with who -- which vendor is going to supply what.

Is it that the -- there aren't branches that you could potentially acquire in those locations? Or they're not for sale, at least not at the right price?

So a couple of questions there, so I'll break it down to stuff about the Acme to clear up any misunderstanding. So within that $300 million of gross CapEx improvement, anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of that, we've been telling people are going to be the Acme assets. The reason why that's not a definitive number is that we are going to buy these throughout the rest of the year. Those assets -- a lot of them that we don't have right now came off -- has to come off rent from where they are, had to be serviced and delivered to us in rent-ready good condition. And if they're not, we won't buy them. 
So where that ends up, we'll know a lot more when we all talk at the end of October by then. Hopefully, we're primarily done. But because this is so back-half-loaded on the receipt of these assets, that's what you wouldn't see the normal correlating CapEx acquisition revenue impact that you'd see, let's say, if we brought them in, in the second quarter. So I think that's what was referred to there. 
And that opportunity came organically. We've had a relationship with them for many, many, many years. And they're changing their model, and we saw it as an opportunity to buy assets that fit our profile very well. So that's how that came up. 
Your second question, I call it the build-versus-buy conversation. We absolutely have a duo-pronged approach to our strategy. As you know, M&A has been a big part of our business. I would even call the Franklin acquisition, part of a build versus buy. We thought we had opportunity to do a better job in the markets they're operating in, and there was an opportunity to do that one, an acquisition versus cold starts. But we're not going to wait just for the perfect deal to come along for us to have organic growth plans, whether it's in specialty or markets where we think we have more opportunities within the overall portfolio in gen rent. 
So it's an analysis we do as part of our pipeline, that build versus buy conversation, and we'll continue to look at it that way."

I also think it's the information that some folks want to access information at their own time in their own way.

The recruiting of drivers is probably the one area, not just for our industry, I think my trash pickup was a little late last month because they didn't have a driver pick up. It's a problem for everybody. It's not going to be for it. So longer term, I think this is an opportunity for us to continue to drive even more efficiency in our business by in-sourcing things that we were doing. 
And as far as the labor market and overall, we're doing pretty well outside of being able to hire more drivers and even get trucks fast enough. 
I would say the rest of our labor situation, we feel really good about. Part of it is our low turnover. So we're not having to replace as many as if we had higher turnover. And frankly, part of it is a decision we made to not do as -- so thank goodness, we didn't do that because it would be really tough right now if we had mass layoffs during COVID and then still had to support this level of activity.

Three months ago, we said that 2021 was shaping up to be a great year for United Rentals, and that's still very much the case. Our operating environment continues to recover. Our customers are increasingly optimistic about their prospects, and our company is continuing to lean into growth from a position of strength as a premium provider and our industry's largest one-stop shop.  
We're the supply leader in a demand environment, and we've leveraged that to deliver another consecutive quarter of strong results.  
The big themes of the second quarter are strong growth in line with our expectations and robust free cash flow, either after the step-up in our CapEx; positive industry indicators, including a strong used equipment market where pricing was up 7% year-over-year; the expansion of our go-to-market platform through M&A and cold starts. This is tied to the broad-based recovery in demand and our focus on operational discipline as we manage the increase in both volume and capacity while driving fleet productivity of nearly 18%.  
Another key takeaway is our safety performance, and I'm very proud of the team for holding the line on safety with another recordable rate below 1, while at the same time, managing a robust busy season and onboarding our acquired locations. This includes General Finance, which we acquired at the end of May.  
As you know, this was both a strategic and a financial move designed to build on our strengths. The acquisition expanded our growth capacity and gave us a leading position in the rental market for mobile storage and office solutions. The integration is going well. And while we still have more work to do, we're moving steadily through our playbook.  
As you saw in our release, we raised our outlook to include the expected impact of general finance and other M&A we closed since the first quarter. It also includes some additional investments we plan to make in CapEx that will serve us beyond 2021. This outlook follows the higher guidance we issued in April when we raised every range compared to our initial guidance. So as you can see, we're tenacious about pursuing profitable growth. And the investments we're making will still have a positive impact on our immediate performance as well as future years.  
And before Jeff gets into the numbers, I want to spend a few minutes on our operating landscape. Almost all of the challenges of 2020 have righted themselves. We have a better line of sight and so do our customers.  
When we surveyed our customers at the end of June, the results showed that over 60% of our customers expect to grow their business over the coming 12 months, which is a post-pandemic high. And notably, only 3% saw a decline coming over the same period.  
Customer optimism is a great barometer. And the trends that we see in the field support their view.  
2021 is a pivotal year for us. It confirms our return to growth, including our 19% rental revenue growth in the second quarter. I'll point to some of the drivers of that growth starting with geography.  
The rebound in our end markets continues to be broadly positive with all geographic regions  reporting year-over-year growth in rental revenue. Our specialty segment generated another strong performance with rental revenue topping 25% year-over-year, including same-store growth of over 19%. And importantly, we grew each major line of business by double digits, which underscores the broadness of the demand.  
For years now, our investment in building out our specialty network has been a key to our strategic positioning. These services differentiate our offering to customers and add resilience to our results throughout the cycles. And this is true of cold starts as well as M&A.  
This year, we've opened 19 new specialty branches in the first 6 months, which puts us well on our way to our goal of 30 by year-end. 
We're also investing in growth in our general rental segment where the big drivers are nonres construction and plant maintenance. Both areas are continuing to gain traction, and most of our end markets are trending up. Verticals like chemical process, food and beverage, metals and mining and health care all showing solid growth. And while the energy sector remains a laggard, it was up year-over-year for the first time in 8 quarters. 
We also have customers in verticals that are less mainstream, like entertainment, where demand for our equipment on movie sets and events more than doubled in the quarter. And while it's a relatively small part of the revenue, it's a good sign to see it come back. I also want to give you some color on project types. There are 2 takeaways, the diversity of the projects in Q2 and the fact that each region contributed to growth in its own way. The recovery has taken root across geographies and verticals on both coasts, with solid activity in heavy manufacturing, corporate campuses, schools and transmission lines. 
In this quarter, we're also seeing project starts in power, transit and technology. These job sites are using our gen rent equipment and our trench safety and power solutions. And fluid solutions are seeing a rebound in chemical processing and sewer bypass work as well as mining. These are just a few of the favorable dynamics in a very promising up cycle. And I want to put that in context. 
2020 was about the temporary loss of market opportunity, particularly in the second quarter. Now the pendulum is swinging back. And 2021 is about locking in that opportunity within the framework of our strategy. Our team is managing that extremely well. 
One proof point is our financial performance and the confidence we have in our guidance. 
Another is our willingness to lean into growth today to create outsized value tomorrow. And it's about more than CapEx and cold starts. We're constantly exploring new ways to capture growth by testing new products in the field, developing new sales pipelines and forging digital connections with customers. And finally, the most important proof point is the quality of our team. You can see that reflected in our safety record and our strong culture. Here's the thing to remember about 2021. 
This is still the early innings of the recovery. We're committed to capitalize on more and more demand as the opportunity unfolds, and we see a long runway ahead to drive growth, create value and deliver shareholder returns. 
Well, I'll stop here and ask Jess to go through the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Jess."

When we increased our 2021 guidance back in April, we expected a strong second quarter, supported by the momentum we were seeing to start the year. We're pleased to see that play out as anticipated with the second quarter results. And importantly, we're also pleased to see the momentum accelerate in our core business and support another raise to our guidance for the year. 
We've also added the impact from our acquisitions, notably the General Finance deal. And I'll give a little bit more color on our guidance in a few minutes, but let's start now with the results for the second quarter. 
Rental revenue for the second quarter was $1.95 billion. That's an increase of $309 million or 19%. If I exclude the impact of acquisitions on that number, rental revenue from the core business grew a healthy 16% year-over-year. 
Within rental revenue, OER increased $231 million or 16.5%. The biggest driver in that change was fleet productivity, which was up 17.8% or $250 million. That's primarily due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes, in part as we comped the COVID impacted second quarter last year. Our average fleet size was up 0.2% or a $3 million tailwind to revenue. And rounding out OER, the inflation impact of 1.5% cost us $22 million. 
Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $65 million or 31%, and re-rent was up $13 million. And we'll talk more about the increase in ancillary revenues in a moment. 
Used equipment sales came in at $194 million. That's an increase of $18 million or about 10%. Pricing at retail in the quarter increased over 7% versus last year and supported robust adjusted used margins of 47.9%. That represents a sequential improvement of 520 basis points and is 190 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. 
Used sales proceeds for the quarter represented a strong recovery of about 59% of the original cost of fleet that was on average over 7 years old. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $999 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year or $100 million. That included $13 million of onetime costs for acquisition activity. The dollar change includes a $141 million increase from rentals. In that, OER was up $125 million. Ancillary contributed $10 million, and re-rent added $6 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, and other non-rental lines of business provided $6 million. 
The impact of SG&A and adjusted EBITDA was a headwind for the quarter of $59 million, which came mostly from the resetting of bonus expense. 
We also had higher commissions on better revenue performance and higher discretionary expenses like T&E that continue to normalize. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 43.7%, down 270 basis points year-over-year, and flow-through as reported was about 29%.  
Let's take a closer look at margin and flow-through this quarter. Importantly, you'll recall that our COVID response last year included a swift and significant pullback in certain operating and discretionary costs. That was especially pronounced in the second quarter and is impacting flow-through this year as activity continues to ramp and costs continue to normalize. And we expect this will play through the rest of the year, notably in the third quarter. 
Specific to the second quarter, we've shared in previous calls that one of the costs that will reset this year is bonus expense from the low levels incurred last year. As a result, we had an expected drag in flow-through in the second quarter as we reset and now true up this year's expense. Flow-through and margins were also impacted as anticipated by acquisition activity, including the onetime costs I mentioned earlier. 
I also mentioned higher ancillary revenue in the second quarter, which represents in part the recovery of higher delivery costs. Delivery has been an area where we've seen the most inflation pressure, including higher cost for fuel and third-party hauling. And while recovering a portion of that increase in ancillary protected gross profit dollars, it impacted flow-through and margin this quarter as a pass-through. And we expect to see that play out over the next couple of quarters as well. 
Adjusting for these few items, the implied flow-through for the second quarter was about 46% with implied margins flat versus last year. With our expenses normalizing, that reflects the cost performance across the core that came in as expected. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $4.66 for the second quarter, including a $0.13 drag from onetime costs. That's up $0.98 versus last year, primarily on higher net income. 
Looking at CapEx and free cash flow. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was a robust $913 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $194 million resulting in net CapEx in the second quarter of $719 million. That's up $750 million versus the second quarter last year. Even as we've invested in significantly higher CapEx spending so far this year, our free cash flow remained very strong at just under $1.2 billion generated through June 30. 
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of CapEx. 
Our balance sheet remains rock solid. Year-over-year, net debt is down 4% or about $454 million. That's after funding over $1.4 billion of acquisition activity this year with the ABL. Leverage was 2.5x at the end of the second quarter. That's flat to where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and an increase of 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter this year, mainly due to the acquisition of General Finance in May. 
A look at our liquidity, which is very strong. We finished the quarter with over $2.8 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $2.4 billion and availability on our AR facility of $106 million. We also had $336 million in cash. 
Moving forward, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. We've raised our full year guidance ranges at the midpoint by $350 million in total revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA as we now expect stronger double-digit growth for the core business in the back half of the year. Our current guidance also includes the impact of acquisition activity since our last update, predominantly to include General Finance. That increase for acquisitions reflects $250 million in total revenue and $60 million in adjusted EBITDA, which includes $15 million of expected full year onetime costs. 
Additional CapEx investment will help support higher demand. To that end, we raised our gross CapEx guidance by $300 million, a good portion of which reflects fleet we're purchasing from Acme Lift. While the fleet will provide some contribution in 2021 and is assumed in our guidance, we expect to see the full benefit next year. 
Finally, our update of free cash flow reflects the additional CapEx we'll buy as well as the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned. It remains a robust $1.7 billion at the midpoint, and we'll continue to earmark our free cash flow this year towards debt reduction to enhance the firepower we have to grow our business. 
Now let's get to your questions. Jonathan, would you please open the line?"

I think investors are wondering out there about how the margins can improve from current levels over the last, say, 4 years or so. We've seen steady degradation on the rental margins. In particular, even EBITDA margins have been under a little pressure. 
I'm just trying to think through like when you think of the 5 large acquisitions you've done over the last few years, right, starting with NES and kind of running through Gen Finance, at the time of acquisition, you bought over, you say about $2.25 billion of revenues, and those EBITDA margins were only 38, right? And you used to run high 40s. So I appreciate that's a lot of revenue you bought that's dragging down the margin. 
But when I look at the business today, moving forward, how do we think about the rental margin structurally if you want to leave that all the way into EBITDA? But really, in particularly the rental margins, is this as much about just a shift towards specialty might lower margins, but improve returns on capital? Just so we can kind of level set how we should think about not just top line growth, growing earnings, but margins."
36005,1674152485,2354603,"United Rentals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Sure, David. Great question.

Thanks for taking a longer-term view of this because that's really how we manage and see the business. And although we have some short-term pressures when we acquire businesses that come in at lower margins, if you look over our experience of these acquired assets and what we've done with the businesses pro forma, it validates why we do M&A. We feel we can be a better owner. We could bring more value to those assets. 
If it drops EBITDA margin for a period of time, that's one metric, but we also are very focused and quite frankly, model our M&A deals on returns. So -- and our returns continue to be well above our cost of capital. 
So I don't think rental margin degradation is a concern for us. We'll continue to drive fleet productivity to overcome natural inflationary costs as well as efficiencies in our operations. And we think that's how we've taken these businesses that are in the 30s yet maintain mid-40s depending on the time of the year to higher EBITDA margin, and that's what we do, right? 
So that's a great question. And I think sometimes, when people are looking at the headline, I mean that's the fact that what we've done with these businesses pro forma is driving more value."

And lastly, on that point, when we think of '22 versus '21, anything you can help us with on framework in the sense of resetting the bonus pool?

I think the takeaway for us is we're going to continue to respond to the way we have, right, in looking to pass through and mitigate some of the inflation pressures that we're seeing right now, particularly in delivery.

But just to give a little bit of color behind what's implied. And I'll start with my normal call out not to anchor to the midpoint here. But let me use the midpoint just to give some color behind those -- the bonus dynamic and even some of the acquisitions impact that we'll have in the back half. 
So if I use the margin at the midpoint, the back half implied margin would be down about 120 basis points for us, and that's going to generate flow through again at midpoint of about 39%. So think about margins, 46.2%. That one headwind is going to continue for us, more so in the third quarter than in the fourth as we think about the comp to last year, where the bonus was, I'll call it, abnormally low, right, just lower than normal. 
So if you think about that bonus headwind as well as the anticipated headwinds in flow-through and margin that we get from the acquisition activity that margin goes from down 120 basis points to up 40 basis points or a margin implied in the back half at midpoint of 47.8% from 46.2%. Flow-through in that at the midpoint, about 50%, adjusting for those 2 items. 
So those obviously will be an impact for us. And as you mentioned, the quarterly dynamic will play out. If you just think about the comps we have against the belt tightening that we did last year, the third quarter will be -- will have more flow-through pressure than you'll see in the fourth. 
And then the other thing I just want to mention in the third quarter just to be helpful in the modeling is third quarter last year, we had $20 million of onetime benefits from insurance recoveries and absolutely not expected to repeat."

We started focusing on this and preparing for this all the way back, if you recall, from the NES acquisition where that added to some of our dirt engaging fleet experience that, that team brought with it and product that brought with it, which would be played into infrastructure. And we've actually been growing our infrastructure business really because the demand is there, right? We all know the need is there. So now we would view this as icing on the cake. 
As far as fleet profile changes, I don't -- I'll hazard a guess to say 80% of the fleet that we would use to support and that we do use to support infrastructure is core fleet. So we have very fluid fleet and very fungible fleet to support this vertical. On the boundaries, yes, we would certainly as things started to move by some more attenuated trucks, buying some message boards, some infrastructure specific fleet. But outside of that, most of what we serve that end market with is core fleet of our very fungible assets. But we feel we're really well positioned, not just talent-wise, not just knowledge-wise, but also relationship-wise. We deal with these large customers, these large civil contractors. So we feel good that whenever the monies get released and gets passed, we'll be able to outcome it to our weight in that category."

If you think about part of the growth that we talked about was cross-sell with the existing United business, but the other part of the growth was to expand that business into more MSAs where they currently aren't, right, so that's an opportunity for us to leverage the efficiencies and the productivities that we have now in our branches as we continue to support that -- those geographic extensions for them.

And on the first part, on the supply side, we've got some really good partners from good suppliers out there, and I think they'll get their arms wrapped around these supply chain disruptions that everybody has been dealing with in every industry.

And I think Jessica said in her introductory comments that the impact from those assets wouldn't really be meaningful this year. And I wondered, if I've interpreted that comment correctly, why that would be. 
And then secondly, also on the topic of I suppose growth capital, when you're thinking about the pace of new branch openings and presumably those branches before they mature, they act as some drag on margin. Is it that the -- there aren't branches that you could potentially acquire in those locations? Or they're not for sale, at least not at the right price? Or is there something else about the sort of the greenfield development that is more attractive than acquiring?"

So a couple of questions there, so I'll break it down to stuff about the Acme to clear up any misunderstanding. So within that $300 million of gross CapEx improvement, anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of that, we've been telling people are going to be the Acme assets. The reason why that's not a definitive number is that we are going to buy these throughout the rest of the year. Those assets -- a lot of them that we don't have right now came off -- has to come off rent from where they are, had to be serviced and delivered to us in rent-ready good condition. And if they're not, we won't buy them. 
So where that ends up, we'll know a lot more when we all talk at the end of October by then. Hopefully, we're primarily done. But because this is so back-half-loaded on the receipt of these assets, that's why you wouldn't see the normal correlating CapEx acquisition revenue impact that you'd see, let's say, if we brought them in, in the second quarter. So I think that's what was referred to there. 
And that opportunity came organically. We've had a relationship with them for many, many, many years. And they're changing their model, and we saw it as an opportunity to buy assets that fit our profile very well. So that's how that came up. 
Your second question, I call it the build-versus-buy conversation. We absolutely have a dual-pronged approach from our strategy. As you know, M&A has been a big part of our business. I would even call the Franklin acquisition, part of a build versus buy. We thought we had opportunity to do a better job in the markets they're operating in, and there was an opportunity to do that one, an acquisition versus cold starts. But we're not going to wait just for the perfect deal to come along for us to have organic growth plans, whether it's in specialty or markets where we think we have more opportunities within the overall portfolio in gen rent. 
So it's an analysis we do as part of our pipeline, that build versus buy conversation, and we'll continue to look at it that way."

I also think it's the information that some folks want to access information at their own time in their own way.

The recruiting of drivers is probably the one area, not just for our industry, I think my trash pickup was a little late last month because they didn't have a driver to pick up. It's a problem for everybody. It's not going to be forever. So longer term, I think this is an opportunity for us to continue to drive even more efficiency in our business by in-sourcing things that we were doing. 
And as far as the labor market and overall, we're doing pretty well outside of being able to hire more drivers and even get trucks fast enough. 
I would say the rest of our labor situation, we feel really good about. Part of it is our low turnover. So we're not having to replace as many as if we had higher turnover. And frankly, part of it is a decision we made to not do layoffs. So thank goodness, we didn't do that because it would be really tough right now if we had mass layoffs during COVID and then still had to support this level of activity. So I feel really good about the way we've managed through it, but still opportunity to in-source in the future, and we've been talking about that a lot strategically here internally."

Thanks for joining our call. We have plenty of positive news to share this morning. As you saw, we delivered a strong quarter, with rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA coming in above our expectations, supported by solid fleet productivity. Today, we'll get under the hood of our results. You'll see the numbers were driven by a combination of factors, both inside and outside the company, including a favorable operating environment that continues to improve and a broad-based growth in customer demand. 
And that's the predominant theme today, not just our growth in key metrics like rental revenue, where we gained 22% year-over-year, but also the growth we see going forward. We fully expect our momentum from the third quarter to continue through the fourth quarter and into the coming years. That's evident in the latest guidance we provided. And as Jess walks you through the outlook, you'll see that the updates are driven by our expectation of higher core rental results this year. Bear in mind that this increase is on top of our July revision, which already accounted for the acquisitions. That tells you we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year.
Before I get into operations, I want to spend a few minutes on our culture, because the quality of our organization is key to our strategy. Clearly, our people are executing well through the busy season. The integration of General Finance is going smoothly, and our team members are being supported by our technology. We also haven't missed the beat on safety. Our company-wide recordable rate remained below 1 again for the quarter and 11 of our regions worked injury-free in September. Results like this showcase the caliber of our team and the value of our people. 
The best-in-class workplace culture we've built for more than a decade delivers tangible benefits, because we're known as an employer of choice. This is a strong competitive advantage, particularly in tight labor markets. We've grown our team by almost 2,000 employees this year, including 500 employees over and above our acquired people, and our turnover rate has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. The other part of our service, of course, is fleet, and this is something we manage very closely. We just guided to our third step-up in rental CapEx this year and each time, the increase has been warranted by customer needs. Our customers are optimistic. They're busy, and they continue to see more growth ahead, and it's our job to be ready for that opportunity. 
Some of you have asked about the challenges of getting equipment delivered. And it's clearly a tight supply environment, but we've been able to secure additional fleet by leveraging our strong financial footing and our relationships with manufacturers. The increase in our CapEx is also based on our leading indicators, which echo customer sentiment. Virtually all of the indicators point to strong industry demand, which bodes well for fleet productivity. The used equipment market is another one of those positive indicators. 
In the third quarter, pricing in our retail channels was up 7% sequentially and up by double digits year-over-year. Used proceeds were 60% of original costs, which is a new high watermark for us. And you may remember back in the second quarter, we talked about our return to growth. In fact, we've been able to leverage the gains we made in the first half of the year to accelerate our growth, and that was despite a tougher comp in Q3. Some of that growth came from acquisitions and cold starts, but even with that factored in, both segments are running ahead of expectations. 
In the third quarter, rental revenue on our gen rent segment was up almost 18% year-over-year, with all regions showing growth. In addition, all of our specialty businesses grew by double digits. Our Specialty segment as a whole was up 36% year-over-year, with 21% growth in same-store rental revenue. And that's higher than the same-store growth rate we reported in the second quarter. We've also opened 24 specialty locations through September, which keeps us on track for the 30 cold starts targeted for the year. 
When you pivot to our end markets, the picture looks similar, broad-based growth across a range of verticals. On the industrial side, we saw widespread growth in rental revenue led by double-digit increases from manufacturing, chemical processing, metals and mining and entertainment. On the construction side, the gains were just as broad, led by nonres construction, where we were up 18% year-over-year. Within nonres, demand is becoming increasingly diverse. 
Warehouse and data center work remains strong, and we're also starting to see a recovery in verticals that have been sluggish like hospitality and education. The power vertical continues to be an important one for us, with wind and solar projects on the rise across multiple regions. We're also seeing work build across the entire EV supply chain. 
Plant maintenance is another big driver for us, and we're seeing that work start up again after being paused for COVID. And the most encouraging trend is project diversity. It's early days, but we're starting to see a healthy mix of new projects like casinos, highway work, hospitals, military bases and more. That signals a return to business confidence. 
As activity picks up, customers have an opportunity to think hard about who they want to do business with, and they're placing an increasing value on corporate responsibility. We have a lot of reputational currency here. Good corporate citizenship has been a priority at United Rentals for years, and our company has a long track record of working with customers to support their ESG goals. We're proud to be recognized by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies for 2 years running. Last week, we released our new corporate responsibility report online. And you'll find that it gives you some good insights into our progress in key areas, like environmental sustainability and workplace inclusion. 
So in summary, we're in a strong position operationally, financially and culturally in a healthy operating environment. Customers have projects lined up stretching well into 2022. The industry remains disciplined and our team is getting equipment out to job sites. Internally, we're focused on controlling costs and expanding our margins as we lean into growth. We're leveraging our scale to deliver a combination of organic growth, targeted cold starts and accretive acquisitions, all with long-term synergies for value creation. 
And in the near term, we reported quarter after quarter of profitable growth, driven by tailwinds that show every indication of enduring. We see a lot of potential for attractive returns, and it gets better from here. 
With that, I'll ask Jess to go over the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Jess, over to you."

Our financial performance in the third quarter highlighted better-than-expected rental revenue which, was supported by broad year-over-year growth across our end markets. On the cost side, we delivered solid results, while activity was at its highest level of the season, and we continue to sell used equipment in a robust market. 
As for the rest of the year, we expect seasonal demand will remain strong. And when coupled with the third quarter's results, this supports a raise to our guidance for the year in total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And more on guidance in a few minutes. Let's start now with the results for the third quarter. 
Rental revenue for the third quarter was $2.28 billion or an increase of $416 million. That's up just over 22% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $325 million or 20.7%. The biggest driver here was fleet productivity, which was up 13.5% or $212 million. That's mainly due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes. Our average fleet size was up 8.7% or a $137 million tailwind to revenue. Rounding out the change in OER is the normal inflation impact of 1.5%, which cost us $24 million. Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $71 million or 29% and re-rent was up $20 million. 
While our outlook to OEC sold for the full year remains unchanged, we made the decision to slow down the volume of fleet sold in the third quarter as we maintained capacity for rental demand. Used sales for the quarter were $183 million, which was down $16 million or about 8% from the third quarter last year. The used market continues to be very strong, which supported higher pricing and margin in the third quarter. Adjusted used margin was 50.3% and represents a sequential improvement of 240 basis points and a year-over-year improvement of 610 basis points. Our used proceeds in Q3 recovered 60% of the original cost of the fleet sold. Now compared to the third quarter of last year, that's a 900 basis point improvement from selling fleet that averages over 7 years old. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just over $1.23 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year or $152 million. The dollar change includes a $219 million increase from rental. Now in that, OER contributed $200 million. Ancillary was up $17 million and re-rent added $2 million. Used sales helped adjusted EBITDA by $4 million and other non-rental lines of business provided $8 million. 
SG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, in part from the reset of bonus expense that we've discussed on our prior earnings call. We also had higher commissions on better revenues and higher T&E, which continues to normalize. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47.5%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was just over 37%. 
Impacting margins and flow-through in Q3 are few items worth noting. We mentioned back in July that bonus expense would be a drag for the back half of this year, with most of the drag in the third quarter. We also have the impact of General Finance, which we've owned all of the third quarter this year, but of course, is not in our comparative results last year. I'll also remind you that we had $20 million of onetime benefits recorded in the third quarter last year that did not repeat. Adjusting for these items, the flow-through was about 58%, with margins up 130 basis points year-over-year. This reflects strong underlying performance in the quarter, particularly when you consider the impact from actions we were taking on costs last year as well as the impact of costs that continue to normalize this year. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $6.58 for the third quarter. That's up $1.18 versus last year, and that's from higher net income. Looking at CapEx and free cash flow, for the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $1.1 billion. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $183 million, resulting in net CapEx in the third quarter of $917 million. That's up $684 million versus the third quarter last year. 
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is up 30 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital. 
Let's turn to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Through September 30, we generated a robust $1.25 billion in free cash flow, which is after considering the sizable increase in CapEx so far this year. We've utilized that free cash flow to help fund over $1.4 billion in acquisition activity, and we reduced net debt almost $100 million. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. Leverage was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter, that's down 10 basis points sequentially and flat versus the end of the third quarter last year, even as we funded acquisitions this past year. 
Liquidity at the end of the third quarter remained strong at over $2.6 billion. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $68 million. We've also had $320 million in cash. I'll also mention we refinanced $1 billion of [ 5 7/8% notes ] earlier in the quarter, and refinancing that debt will save $29 million in cash interest in 2022 and extends our next long-term note maturity out to 2027. 
As we look out to the end of the year, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. Given we have a quarter to go, we've tightened our full year ranges for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And importantly, have raised our expectations for both. These updates reflect better-than-expected third quarter results and the continuing momentum we see in demand and in managing our costs for the fourth quarter. We've again raised our outlook for growth CapEx this year with a $250 million increase at the midpoint. This means we would land more fleet than normal in the fourth quarter and that's supported by our planning for strong growth in 2022. 
We've left the range on CapEx a little wider than we would normally at this time of the year as we continue to work with the OEMs to land what we've ordered. And finally, our update to free cash flow reflects the impact of these guidance changes, notably the additional CapEx we expect to buy. And even with that increased investment in CapEx, free cash flow remains strong at over $1.5 billion at the midpoint. 
So now let's get to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

I'll start -- there's a couple of things I'd say on both sides of the ledger to consider as we get through our planning process for 2022. I'll start on the benefit side. 
The first would be that we will have a tailwind from the bonus adjustment that we've mentioned the last few quarters. So you could assume as that bonus resets next year, that's going to be about a $50 million tailwind that will carry into 2022. The other, I would say, positive, as we're considering '22, particularly as we're thinking of it as a strong year is really the benefit that we'll get through revenue, right, and the volume and the activity that will flow through the top line. 
On the other side, I would say is, again, we're sharpening our pencil on details for the plan. We are considering the inflation impact, not surprisingly, we expect that there'll be some continuing cost inflation, particularly in some of the bigger lines for us as you think about labor and delivery and R&M. So we're working through those as we work to get our plan pulled together. 
We also have additional costs that are going to normalize, right? That will serve as a bit of a headwind, T&E, the most obvious example. As we look at what the normal level of activity, cost activity would be for us in discretionary costs that, again, will continue to normalize. And then the other margin impact, I'd say, really for the first half of the year, would be on lapping the acquisitions, right, and the impact that, that will have again through, I would say, the end of the second quarter. 
So I hope that's helpful as a framework. I will just broadly also say we do expect that margins will be up in 2022, and we do expect that we'll be back in that normal range of flow-through that we target, somewhere between 50% and 60%."

We'll have a little bit of that baseline tailwind in Q1, but after that, it will be gone. And I will just tell you, without getting into the specific quantification, certainly, absorption was at a real high level this year. And if we were able to replicate this level of you next year, we'd be really pleased. 
But we're not going to get into the details and cherry pick this because it's a good story. And I think the discipline in the industry and the way that we've talked about and categorize the supply-demand environment. We do agree that at some point next year, this will be positive derived fleet productivity maybe on some of the other factors even more so. So we're looking forward to that. I don't think we'll see these big double-digit numbers again because we had such an absorption tailwind, but we certainly can exceed our inflationary factors that we target at 1.5%. So we feel good about that opportunity next year."

The pipeline is still there. We think consolidation is still an opportunity in the industry. And so stay tuned. 
It's really more about what makes it through the end of the pipeline and making sure that it meets our criteria strategically, culturally and most importantly, financially. So we certainly have the dry powder. We want to use it for growth first, but we're going to only do smart deals. And if that doesn't come through, then Jess has the pleasure of dealing with capital allocations in a different way, once we get leverage down to the bottom of our rate."

So we have plenty of channels to get through in some products. Maybe we went to our second level, second tier suppliers, but still good products that our customers accept. So opening up those channels actually will probably help us next year. And we feel really good about where we are with the ability to get the fleet will need to support customer demand.

I think there is opportunity of scale that supports consolidation from a competitiveness perspective, but there's still a very broad range of business out there. So I don't necessarily feel -- I don't think we're going to see people taking pain that they can't absorb. And it's one year still cost remedy, some of these costs will go back down. So I think the supply/demand discipline will remain. And I think that your comments support that I wouldn't go the next step further. It doesn't thin out the herd, so to speak. I'm not really seeing that right now."

And how that balance comes through to me is more of an output of how you implement your strategy versus the strategy, right? We have a growth imperative. And the part that we can control is making sure we build a mechanism for organic growth. That's why we focus so much on cross-selling and our value prop. Whether those products are new introductions because we bought them through an acquisition or whether we acquire them from an OEM, we still have the same mindset of one-stop shop full value prop to the customer is going to support growth.

That's the first question. 
And then the second one, is calling back to Jess's comments on the margin framework for next year. And I understand that you don't talk specifically about rate. But a couple of your competitors have indicated that rate increases year-on-year in the region of 2.5% to 3% would be sufficient to offset the cost inflation that they see in their SG&A base.

We are not going to cherry pick talking about the individual components when it's in our benefit. So -- but I think that the tone of a positive environment to drive better returns through fleet productivity is the right tone. And I'm pleased to hear how our peers are talking about it. And the industry overall, how it's responding. 
So everybody's got their own inflationary pressures and the way they're going to work through it. But I also think it's not just tied to what your cost base is, it's what's the value you're bringing and what's the mix of products and services you're offering. So that one is an easy answer me. 
As far as the leading indicators, I mean, you guys all can see everything we can see, except for a couple of different things. Our customer confidence index remains very strong. We have over 60% of our customers feel next year is going to be better and only 3% think that there is a potential for them to be down year-over-year. So that's a real strong sentiment. And then the feedback from the people that we have in the field, whether it's the sales team, the national account team and the managers that stay very close to the business and the pipeline, we talk about we have anywhere from 7 to 12 months visibility. 
And certainly, recently, we've been on the shorter end of that coming out of the disruption of the cycle. That hasn't changed. So I don't think we are any better than anybody else in forecasting how long the cycle is, but there are no signs that say that it's going to be a short cycle. Quite contrary, one of the things I'd say that could lengthen it is we're not even factoring in infrastructure bill and funding, which we think will be a great opportunity for us. And if they approved it today, it wouldn't manifest in '22. It'd be something that we get '23 and beyond. So that would be another pickup to the cycle. 
So I'm not seeing anything that would denote a shorter than normal cycle. Admittedly, we don't have that any more visibility anybody else into that long-term cycle. The good news is we have a business model that doesn't require it. As we've shown over the past 2 years, we can adjust very quickly and adjust to the opportunities or not that are there for us."

Thanks for joining our call. We have plenty of positive news to share this morning. As you saw, we delivered a strong quarter, with rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA coming in above our expectations, supported by solid fleet productivity. Today, we'll get under the hood of our results. You'll see the numbers were driven by a combination of factors, both inside and outside the company, including a favorable operating environment that continues to improve and a broad-based growth in customer demand.
And that's the predominant theme today, not just our growth in key metrics like rental revenue, where we gained 22% year-over-year, but also the growth we see going forward. We fully expect our momentum from the third quarter to continue through the fourth quarter and into the coming years. That's evident in the latest guidance we provided. And as Jess walks you through the outlook, you'll see that the updates are driven by our expectation of higher core rental results this year. Bear in mind that this increase is on top of our July revision, which already accounted for the acquisitions. That tells you we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year.
Before I get into operations, I want to spend a few minutes on our culture, because the quality of our organization is key to our strategy. Clearly, our people are executing well through the busy season. The integration of General Finance is going smoothly, and our team members are being supported by our technology. We also haven't missed the beat on safety. Our company-wide recordable rate remained below 1 again for the quarter and 11 of our regions worked injury-free in September. Results like this showcase the caliber of our team and the value of our people.
The best-in-class workplace culture we've built for more than a decade delivers tangible benefits, because we're known as an employer of choice. This is a strong competitive advantage, particularly in tight labor markets. We've grown our team by almost 2,000 employees this year, including 500 employees over and above our acquired people, and our turnover rate has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. The other part of our service, of course, is fleet, and this is something we manage very closely. We just guided to our third step-up in rental CapEx this year. And each time the increase has been warranted by customer needs. Our customers are optimistic. They're busy, and they continue to see more growth ahead, and it's our job to be ready for that opportunity.
Some of you have asked about the challenges of getting equipment delivered. And it's clearly a tight supply environment, but we've been able to secure additional fleet by leveraging our strong financial footing and our relationships with manufacturers. The increase in our CapEx is also based on our leading indicators, which echo customer sentiment. Virtually all of the indicators point to strong industry demand, which bodes well for fleet productivity. The used equipment market is another one of those positive indicators.
In the third quarter, pricing in our retail channels was up 7% sequentially and up by double digits year-over-year. Used proceeds were 60% of original costs, which is a new high watermark for us. And you may remember back in the second quarter, we talked about our return to growth. In fact, we've been able to leverage the gains we made in the first half of the year to accelerate our growth, and that was despite a tougher comp in Q3. Some of that growth came from acquisitions and cold starts, but even with that factored in, both segments are running ahead of expectations.
In the third quarter, rental revenue on our gen rent segment was up almost 18% year-over-year, with all regions showing growth. In addition, all of our specialty businesses grew by double digits. Our Specialty segment as a whole was up 36% year-over-year, with 21% growth in same-store rental revenue. And that's higher than the same-store growth rate we reported in the second quarter. We've also opened 24 specialty locations through September, which keeps us on track for the 30 cold starts targeted for the year.
When you pivot to our end markets, the picture looks similar, broad-based growth across a range of verticals. On the industrial side, we saw widespread growth in rental revenue led by double-digit increases from manufacturing, chemical processing, metals and mining and entertainment. On the construction side, the gains were just as broad, led by non-res construction, where we were up 18% year-over-year. Within non-res, demand is becoming increasingly diverse.
Warehouse and data center work remains strong, and we're also starting to see a recovery in verticals that have been sluggish, like hospitality and education. The Power vertical continues to be an important one for us, with wind and solar projects on the rise across multiple regions. We're also seeing work build across the entire EV supply chain.
Plant maintenance is another big driver for us, and we're seeing that work start up again after being paused for COVID. And the most encouraging trend is project diversity. It's early days, but we're starting to see a healthy mix of new projects like casinos, highway work, hospitals, military bases and more. That signals a return to business confidence.
As activity picks up, customers have an opportunity to think hard about who they want to do business with, and they're placing an increasing value on corporate responsibility. We have a lot of reputational currency here. Good corporate citizenship has been a priority at United Rentals for years, and our company has a long track record of working with customers to support their ESG goals. We're proud to be recognized by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies for 2 years running. Last week, we released our new corporate responsibility report online. And you'll find that it gives you some good insights into our progress in key areas, like environmental sustainability and workplace inclusion.
So in summary, we're in a strong position operationally, financially and culturally in a healthy operating environment. Customers have projects lined up stretching well into 2022. The industry remains disciplined and our team is getting equipment out to job sites. Internally, we're focused on controlling costs and expanding our margins as we lean into growth. We're leveraging our scale to deliver a combination of organic growth, targeted cold starts and accretive acquisitions, all with long-term synergies for value creation.
And in the near term, we reported quarter after quarter of profitable growth, driven by tailwinds that show every indication of enduring. We see a lot of potential for attractive returns, and it gets better from here.
With that, I'll ask Jess to go over the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Jess, over to you."

Our financial performance in the third quarter highlighted better-than-expected rental revenue, which was supported by broad year-over-year growth across our end markets. On the cost side, we delivered solid results, while activity was at its highest level of the season, and we continue to sell used equipment in a robust market.
As for the rest of the year, we expect seasonal demand will remain strong. And when coupled with the third quarter's results, this supports a raise to our guidance for the year in total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And more on guidance in a few minutes. Let's start now with the results for the third quarter.
Rental revenue for the third quarter was $2.28 billion or an increase of $416 million. That's up just over 22% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $325 million or 20.7%. The biggest driver here was fleet productivity, which was up 13.5% or $212 million. That's mainly due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes. Our average fleet size was up 8.7% or a $137 million tailwind to revenue. Rounding out the change in OER is the normal inflation impact of 1.5%, which cost us $24 million. Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $71 million or 29% and re-rent was up $20 million.
While our outlook to OEC sold for the full year remains unchanged, we made the decision to slow down the volume of fleet sold in the third quarter as we maintained capacity for rental demand. Used sales for the quarter were $183 million, which was down $16 million or about 8% from the third quarter last year. The used market continues to be very strong, which supported higher pricing and margin in the third quarter. Adjusted used margin was 50.3% and represents a sequential improvement of 240 basis points and a year-over-year improvement of 610 basis points. Our used proceeds in Q3 recovered 60% of the original cost of the fleet sold. Now compared to the third quarter of last year, that's a 900 basis point improvement from selling fleet that averages over 7 years old.
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just over $1.23 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year or $152 million. The dollar change includes a $219 million increase from rental. Now in that, OER contributed $200 million. Ancillary was up $17 million and re-rent added $2 million. Used sales helped adjusted EBITDA by $4 million and other non-rental lines of business provided $8 million.
SG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, in part from the reset of bonus expense that we've discussed on our prior earnings call. We also had higher commissions on better revenues and higher T&E, which continues to normalize. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47.5%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was just over 37%.
Impacting margins and flow-through in Q3 are few items worth noting. We mentioned back in July that bonus expense would be a drag for the back half of this year, with most of the drag in the third quarter. We also have the impact of General Finance, which we've owned all of the third quarter this year, but of course, is not in our comparative results last year. I'll also remind you that we had $20 million of onetime benefits recorded in the third quarter last year that did not repeat. Adjusting for these items, the flow-through was about 58%, with margins up 130 basis points year-over-year. This reflects strong underlying performance in the quarter, particularly when you consider the impact from actions we were taking on costs last year as well as the impact of costs that continue to normalize this year.
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $6.58 for the third quarter. That's up $1.18 versus last year, and that's from higher net income. Looking at CapEx and free cash flow for the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $1.1 billion. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $183 million, resulting in net CapEx in the third quarter of $917 million. That's up $684 million versus the third quarter last year.
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is up 30 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital.
Let's turn to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Through September 30, we generated a robust $1.25 billion in free cash flow, which is after considering the sizable increase in CapEx so far this year. We've utilized that free cash flow to help fund over $1.4 billion in acquisition activity, and we reduced net debt almost $100 million. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. Leverage was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter, that's down 10 basis points sequentially and flat versus the end of the third quarter last year, even as we funded acquisitions this past year.
Liquidity at the end of the third quarter remained strong at over $2.6 billion. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $68 million. We've also had $320 million in cash. I'll also mention we refinanced $1 billion of  [ 5 7/8% notes ] earlier in the quarter, and refinancing that debt will save $29 million in cash interest in 2022 and extends our next long-term note maturity out to 2027.
As we look out to the end of the year, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. Given we have a quarter to go, we've tightened our full year ranges for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And importantly, have raised our expectations for both. These updates reflect better-than-expected third quarter results and the continuing momentum we see in demand and in managing our costs for the fourth quarter. We've again raised our outlook for growth CapEx this year with a $250 million increase at the midpoint. This means we would land more fleet than normal in the fourth quarter and that's supported by our planning for strong growth in 2022.
We've left the range on CapEx a little wider than we would normally at this time of the year as we continue to work with the OEMs to land what we've ordered. And finally, our update to free cash flow reflects the impact of these guidance changes, notably the additional CapEx we expect to buy. And even with that increased investment in CapEx, free cash flow remains strong at over $1.5 billion at the midpoint.

I'll start -- there's a couple of things I'd say on both sides of the ledger to consider as we get through our planning process for 2022. I'll start on the benefit side.
The first would be that we will have a tailwind from the bonus adjustment that we've mentioned the last few quarters. So you could assume as that bonus resets next year, that's going to be about a $50 million tailwind that will carry into 2022. The other, I would say, positive, as we're considering '22, particularly as we're thinking of it as a strong year, is really the benefit that we'll get through revenue, right, and the volume and the activity that will flow through the top line.
On the other side, I would say is, again, we're sharpening our pencil on details for the plan. We are considering the inflation impact, not surprisingly, we expect that there'll be some continuing cost inflation, particularly in some of the bigger lines for us as you think about labor and delivery, and R&M. So we're working through those as we work to get our plan pulled together. 
We also have additional costs that are going to normalize, right? That will serve as a bit of a headwind, T&E, the most obvious example. As we look at what the normal level of activity, cost activity would be for us in discretionary costs that, again, will continue to normalize. And then the other margin impact, I'd say, really for the first half of the year would be on lapping the acquisitions, right? And the impact that, that will have again through, I would say, the end of the second quarter.
So I hope that's helpful as a framework. I will just broadly also say we do expect that margins will be up in 2022, and we do expect that we'll be back in that normal range of flow-through that we target, somewhere between 50% and 60%."

We'll have a little bit of that baseline tailwind in Q1, but after that, it will be gone. And I will just tell you, without getting into the specific quantification, certainly, absorption was at a real high level this year. And if we were able to replicate this level of -- next year, we'd be really pleased.
But we're not going to get into the details and cherry pick this because it's a good story. And I think the discipline in the industry and the way that we've talked about and categorize the supply-demand environment, we do agree that at some point next year, this will be positive derived fleet productivity, maybe on some of the other factors even more so. So we're looking forward to that. I don't think we'll see these big double-digit numbers again because we had such an absorption tailwind, but we certainly can exceed our inflationary factors that we target at 1.5%.

The pipeline is still there. We think consolidation is still an opportunity in the industry. And so stay tuned.
It's really more about what makes it through the end of the pipeline and making sure that it meets our criteria strategically, culturally and most importantly, financially. So we certainly have the dry powder. We want to use it for growth first, but we're going to only do smart deals.

So we have plenty of channels to get through in some products. Maybe we went to our second level, second tier suppliers, but still good products that our customers accept. So opening up those channels actually will probably help us next year. And we feel really good about where we are with the ability to get the fleet, will need to support customer demand.

Whether those products are new introductions because we bought them through an acquisition or whether we acquire them from an OEM, we still have the same mindset of one-stop shop, full-value prop to the customer is going to support growth.

That's the first question.
And then the second one, is calling back to Jess's comments on the margin framework for next year. And I understand that you don't talk specifically about rate. But a couple of your competitors have indicated that rate increases year-on-year in the region of 2.5% to 3% would be sufficient to offset the cost inflation that they see in their SG&A base.

We are not going to cherrypick talking about the individual components when it's in our benefit. So -- but I think that the tone of a positive environment to drive better returns through fleet productivity is the right tone. And I'm pleased to hear how our peers are talking about it. And the industry overall, how it's responding. 
So everybody's got their own inflationary pressures and the way they're going to work through it. But I also think it's not just tied to what your cost base is, it's what's the value you're bringing and what's the mix of products and services you're offering. So that one is an easy answer me. 
As far as the leading indicators, I mean, you guys all can see everything we can see, except for a couple of different things. Our customer confidence index remains very strong. We have over 60% of our customers feel next year is going to be better and only 3% think that there is a potential for them to be down year-over-year. So that's a real strong sentiment. And then the feedback from the people that we have in the field, whether it's the sales team, the national account team and the managers that stay very close to the business and the pipeline, we talk about we have anywhere from 7 to 12 months' visibility. 
And certainly, recently, we've been on the shorter end of that coming out of the disruption of the cycle. That hasn't changed. So I don't think we are any better than anybody else in forecasting how long the cycle is, but there are no signs that say that it's going to be a short cycle. Quite contrary, one of the things I'd say that could lengthen it is we're not even factoring in infrastructure bill and funding, which we think will be a great opportunity for us. And if they approved it today, it wouldn't manifest in '22. It'd be something that we get '23 and beyond. So that would be another pickup to the cycle.
So I'm not seeing anything that would denote a shorter than normal cycle. Admittedly, we don't have that any more visibility anybody else into that long-term cycle. The good news is we have a business model that doesn't require it. As we've shown over the past 2 years, we can adjust very quickly and adjust to the opportunities or not that are there for us."

Thanks for joining our call. We have plenty of positive news to share this morning. As you saw, we delivered a strong quarter, with rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA coming in above our expectations, supported by solid fleet productivity. Today, we'll get under the hood of our results. You'll see the numbers were driven by a combination of factors, both inside and outside the company, including a favorable operating environment that continues to improve and a broad-based growth in customer demand.
And that's the predominant theme today, not just our growth in key metrics like rental revenue, where we gained 22% year-over-year, but also the growth we see going forward. We fully expect our momentum from the third quarter to continue through the fourth quarter and into the coming years. That's evident in the latest guidance we provided. And as Jess walks you through the outlook, you'll see that the updates are driven by our expectation of higher core rental results this year. Bear in mind that this increase is on top of our July revision, which already accounted for the acquisitions. That tells you we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year.
Before I get into operations, I want to spend a few minutes on our culture, because the quality of our organization is key to our strategy. Clearly, our people are executing well through the busy season. The integration of General Finance is going smoothly, and our team members are being supported by our technology. We also haven't missed the beat on safety. Our company-wide recordable rate remained below 1 again for the quarter and 11 of our regions worked injury-free in September. Results like this showcase the caliber of our team and the value of our people.
The best-in-class workplace culture we've built for more than a decade delivers tangible benefits, because we're known as an employer of choice. This is a strong competitive advantage, particularly in tight labor markets. We've grown our team by almost 2,000 employees this year, including 500 employees over and above our acquired people, and our turnover rate has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. The other part of our service, of course, is fleet, and this is something we manage very closely. We just guided to our third step-up in rental CapEx this year. And each time the increase has been warranted by customer needs. Our customers are optimistic. They're busy, and they continue to see more growth ahead, and it's our job to be ready for that opportunity.
Some of you have asked about the challenges of getting equipment delivered. And it's clearly a tight supply environment, but we've been able to secure additional fleet by leveraging our strong financial footing and our relationships with manufacturers. The increase in our CapEx is also based on our leading indicators, which echo customer sentiment. Virtually all of the indicators point to strong industry demand, which bodes well for fleet productivity. The used equipment market is another one of those positive indicators.
In the third quarter, pricing in our retail channels was up 7% sequentially and up by double digits year-over-year. Used proceeds were 60% of original costs, which is a new high watermark for us. And you may remember back in the second quarter, we talked about our return to growth. In fact, we've been able to leverage the gains we made in the first half of the year to accelerate our growth, and that was despite a tougher comp in Q3. Some of that growth came from acquisitions and cold starts, but even with that factored in, both segments are running ahead of expectations.
In the third quarter, rental revenue on our gen rent segment was up almost 18% year-over-year, with all regions showing growth. In addition, all of our specialty businesses grew by double digits. Our Specialty segment as a whole was up 36% year-over-year, with 21% growth in same-store rental revenue. And that's higher than the same-store growth rate we reported in the second quarter. We've also opened 24 specialty locations through September, which keeps us on track for the 30 cold starts targeted for the year.
When you pivot to our end markets, the picture looks similar, broad-based growth across a range of verticals. On the industrial side, we saw widespread growth in rental revenue led by double-digit increases from manufacturing, chemical processing, metals and mining and entertainment. On the construction side, the gains were just as broad, led by non-res construction, where we were up 18% year-over-year. Within non-res, demand is becoming increasingly diverse.
Warehouse and data center work remains strong, and we're also starting to see a recovery in verticals that have been sluggish, like hospitality and education. The Power vertical continues to be an important one for us, with wind and solar projects on the rise across multiple regions. We're also seeing work build across the entire EV supply chain.
Plant maintenance is another big driver for us, and we're seeing that work start up again after being paused for COVID. And the most encouraging trend is project diversity. It's early days, but we're starting to see a healthy mix of new projects like casinos, highway work, hospitals, military bases and more. That signals a return to business confidence.
As activity picks up, customers have an opportunity to think hard about who they want to do business with, and they're placing an increasing value on corporate responsibility. We have a lot of reputational currency here. Good corporate citizenship has been a priority at United Rentals for years, and our company has a long track record of working with customers to support their ESG goals. We're proud to be recognized by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies for 2 years running. Last week, we released our new corporate responsibility report online. And you'll find that it gives you some good insights into our progress in key areas, like environmental sustainability and workplace inclusion.
So in summary, we're in a strong position operationally, financially and culturally in a healthy operating environment. Customers have projects lined up stretching well into 2022. The industry remains disciplined and our team is getting equipment out to job sites. Internally, we're focused on controlling costs and expanding our margins as we lean into growth. We're leveraging our scale to deliver a combination of organic growth, targeted cold starts and accretive acquisitions, all with long-term synergies for value creation.
And in the near term, we reported quarter after quarter of profitable growth, driven by tailwinds that show every indication of enduring. We see a lot of potential for attractive returns, and it gets better from here.
With that, I'll ask Jess to go over the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Jess, over to you."

Our financial performance in the third quarter highlighted better-than-expected rental revenue, which was supported by broad year-over-year growth across our end markets. On the cost side, we delivered solid results, while activity was at its highest level of the season, and we continue to sell used equipment in a robust market.
As for the rest of the year, we expect seasonal demand will remain strong. And when coupled with the third quarter's results, this supports a raise to our guidance for the year in total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And more on guidance in a few minutes. Let's start now with the results for the third quarter.
Rental revenue for the third quarter was $2.28 billion or an increase of $416 million. That's up just over 22% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $325 million or 20.7%. The biggest driver here was fleet productivity, which was up 13.5% or $212 million. That's mainly due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes. Our average fleet size was up 8.7% or a $137 million tailwind to revenue. Rounding out the change in OER is the normal inflation impact of 1.5%, which cost us $24 million. Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $71 million or 29% and re-rent was up $20 million.
While our outlook to OEC sold for the full year remains unchanged, we made the decision to slow down the volume of fleet sold in the third quarter as we maintained capacity for rental demand. Used sales for the quarter were $183 million, which was down $16 million or about 8% from the third quarter last year. The used market continues to be very strong, which supported higher pricing and margin in the third quarter. Adjusted used margin was 50.3% and represents a sequential improvement of 240 basis points and a year-over-year improvement of 610 basis points. Our used proceeds in Q3 recovered 60% of the original cost of the fleet sold. Now compared to the third quarter of last year, that's a 900 basis point improvement from selling fleet that averages over 7 years old.
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just over $1.23 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year or $152 million. The dollar change includes a $219 million increase from rental. Now in that, OER contributed $200 million. Ancillary was up $17 million and re-rent added $2 million. Used sales helped adjusted EBITDA by $4 million and other non-rental lines of business provided $8 million.
SG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, in part from the reset of bonus expense that we've discussed on our prior earnings call. We also had higher commissions on better revenues and higher T&E, which continues to normalize. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47.5%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was just over 37%.
Impacting margins and flow-through in Q3 are few items worth noting. We mentioned back in July that bonus expense would be a drag for the back half of this year, with most of the drag in the third quarter. We also have the impact of General Finance, which we've owned all of the third quarter this year, but of course, is not in our comparative results last year. I'll also remind you that we had $20 million of onetime benefits recorded in the third quarter last year that did not repeat. Adjusting for these items, the flow-through was about 58%, with margins up 130 basis points year-over-year. This reflects strong underlying performance in the quarter, particularly when you consider the impact from actions we were taking on costs last year as well as the impact of costs that continue to normalize this year.
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $6.58 for the third quarter. That's up $1.18 versus last year, and that's from higher net income. Looking at CapEx and free cash flow for the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $1.1 billion. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $183 million, resulting in net CapEx in the third quarter of $917 million. That's up $684 million versus the third quarter last year.
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is up 30 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital.
Let's turn to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Through September 30, we generated a robust $1.25 billion in free cash flow, which is after considering the sizable increase in CapEx so far this year. We've utilized that free cash flow to help fund over $1.4 billion in acquisition activity, and we reduced net debt almost $100 million. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. Leverage was 2.4x at the end of the third quarter, that's down 10 basis points sequentially and flat versus the end of the third quarter last year, even as we funded acquisitions this past year.
Liquidity at the end of the third quarter remained strong at over $2.6 billion. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $68 million. We've also had $320 million in cash. I'll also mention we refinanced $1 billion of  [ 5 7/8% notes ] earlier in the quarter, and refinancing that debt will save $29 million in cash interest in 2022 and extends our next long-term note maturity out to 2027.
As we look out to the end of the year, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. Given we have a quarter to go, we've tightened our full year ranges for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And importantly, have raised our expectations for both. These updates reflect better-than-expected third quarter results and the continuing momentum we see in demand and in managing our costs for the fourth quarter. We've again raised our outlook for growth CapEx this year with a $250 million increase at the midpoint. This means we would land more fleet than normal in the fourth quarter and that's supported by our planning for strong growth in 2022.
We've left the range on CapEx a little wider than we would normally at this time of the year as we continue to work with the OEMs to land what we've ordered. And finally, our update to free cash flow reflects the impact of these guidance changes, notably the additional CapEx we expect to buy. And even with that increased investment in CapEx, free cash flow remains strong at over $1.5 billion at the midpoint.
So now let's get to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

I'll start -- there's a couple of things I'd say on both sides of the ledger to consider as we get through our planning process for 2022. I'll start on the benefit side.
The first would be that we will have a tailwind from the bonus adjustment that we've mentioned the last few quarters. So you could assume as that bonus resets next year, that's going to be about a $50 million tailwind that will carry into 2022. The other, I would say, positive, as we're considering '22, particularly as we're thinking of it as a strong year, is really the benefit that we'll get through revenue, right, and the volume and the activity that will flow through the top line.
On the other side, I would say is, again, we're sharpening our pencil on details for the plan. We are considering the inflation impact, not surprisingly, we expect that there'll be some continuing cost inflation, particularly in some of the bigger lines for us as you think about labor and delivery, and R&M. So we're working through those as we work to get our plan pulled together. 
We also have additional costs that are going to normalize, right? That will serve as a bit of a headwind, T&E, the most obvious example. As we look at what the normal level of activity, cost activity would be for us in discretionary costs that, again, will continue to normalize. And then the other margin impact, I'd say, really for the first half of the year would be on lapping the acquisitions, right? And the impact that, that will have again through, I would say, the end of the second quarter.
So I hope that's helpful as a framework. I will just broadly also say we do expect that margins will be up in 2022, and we do expect that we'll be back in that normal range of flow-through that we target, somewhere between 50% and 60%."

We'll have a little bit of that baseline tailwind in Q1, but after that, it will be gone. And I will just tell you, without getting into the specific quantification, certainly, absorption was at a real high level this year. And if we were able to replicate this level of -- next year, we'd be really pleased.
But we're not going to get into the details and cherry pick this because it's a good story. And I think the discipline in the industry and the way that we've talked about and categorize the supply-demand environment, we do agree that at some point next year, this will be positive derived fleet productivity, maybe on some of the other factors even more so. So we're looking forward to that. I don't think we'll see these big double-digit numbers again because we had such an absorption tailwind, but we certainly can exceed our inflationary factors that we target at 1.5%.

The pipeline is still there. We think consolidation is still an opportunity in the industry. And so stay tuned.
It's really more about what makes it through the end of the pipeline and making sure that it meets our criteria strategically, culturally and most importantly, financially. So we certainly have the dry powder. We want to use it for growth first, but we're going to only do smart deals. And if that doesn't come through, then Jess has the pleasure of dealing with capital allocations in a different way once we get leverage down to the bottom of our rate."

So we have plenty of channels to get through in some products. Maybe we went to our second level, second tier suppliers, but still good products that our customers accept. So opening up those channels actually will probably help us next year. And we feel really good about where we are with the ability to get the fleet, will need to support customer demand.

So I think everybody will find their place. I do think the bigs will continue to get bigger.

So I don't necessarily feel -- I don't think we're going to see people taking pain that they can't absorb. And it's one year [indiscernible] remedy, some of these costs will go back down.

And how that balance comes through to me is more of an output of how you implement your strategy versus the strategy, right? We have a growth imperative.

But the dynamics for driving all parts of fleet productivity to positive, were there this year. It was just math. That's why you may be skewed towards one or the other. And I think that, that will remedy next year and the balance will be a little bit different. One of the reasons why we talk about it in a consolidated way is because it's an interplay of the 3 factors that really matter. And I think to categorize there may be a shift from absorption to other opportunities next year, is an appropriate way to look at."

And say, I mean what's obviously an exceptionally strong environment at the moment, is there anything in those lead indicators that suggest that this cycle might be stronger but shorter, because it is clearly exceptionally strong right now? That's the first question.
And then the second one, is calling back to Jess's comments on the margin framework for next year. And I understand that you don't talk specifically about rate. But a couple of your competitors have indicated that rate increases year-on-year in the region of 2.5% to 3% would be sufficient to offset the cost inflation that they see in their SG&A base. Would you be prepared to sort of, I guess, confirm or deny whether you agree with that statement?"

We are not going to cherrypick talking about the individual components when it's in our benefit. So -- but I think that the tone of a positive environment to drive better returns through fleet productivity is the right tone. And I'm pleased to hear how our peers are talking about it. And the industry overall, how it's responding. 
So everybody's got their own inflationary pressures and the way they're going to work through it. But I also think it's not just tied to what your cost base is, it's what's the value you're bringing and what's the mix of products and services you're offering. So that one is an easy answer me. 
As far as the leading indicators, I mean, you guys all can see everything we can see, except for a couple of different things. Our customer confidence index remains very strong. We have over 60% of our customers feel next year is going to be better and only 3% think that there is a potential for them to be down year-over-year. So that's a real strong sentiment. And then the feedback from the people that we have in the field, whether it's the sales team, the national account team and the managers that stay very close to the business and the pipeline, we talk about we have anywhere from 7 to 12 months' visibility. 
And certainly, recently, we've been on the shorter end of that coming out of the disruption of the cycle. That hasn't changed. So I don't think we are any better than anybody else in forecasting how long the cycle is, but there are no signs that say that it's going to be a short cycle. Quite contrary, one of the things I'd say that could lengthen it is we're not even factoring in infrastructure bill and funding, which we think will be a great opportunity for us. And if they approved it today, it wouldn't manifest in '22. It'd be something that we get '23 and beyond. So that would be another pickup to the cycle.
So I'm not seeing anything that would denote a shorter than normal cycle. Admittedly, we don't have that any more visibility anybody else into that long-term cycle. The good news is we have a business model that doesn't require it. As we've shown over the past 2 years, we can adjust very quickly and adjust to the opportunities or not that are there for us."

As you saw yesterday, we reported a really strong performance out of the gate in '21 in what's shaping up to be a great year. We knew we had built good momentum in Q4 and that the economy was moving in the right direction. But the first quarter was still uncertain as we entered the year. 
Well not anymore, both our operating conditions and our performance have improved faster than we expected. We gained back a lot of the ground on rental revenue, narrowing the decline from 2020. And importantly, we exited the quarter up year-over-year in March. Our customers are also optimistic. They're gaining more visibility and they're turning to us for the equipment they need. 
Just a few months into the year, we've absorbed almost all of the excess fleet we had in 2020. This was evident in the sequential improvement in our fleet productivity that we reported. And we took advantage of a healthy used equipment market, driving record retail sales to generate almost 30% more proceeds in the quarter than we did a year ago. 
None of this would be possible without our greatest asset, our employees and their willingness to take on the challenges as well as the opportunities presented to them. I want people know how much I respect them for their commitment, and our customers feel the same way. And I'm proud to report that Team United delivered $873 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, and they did it safely, turning in another quarterly recordable rate below 1. And given all these factors, we feel confident in raising guidance across the board. This includes a new revenue range that starts above the top end of the previous guidance. 
We feel equally comfortable leaning into M&A, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Franklin Equipment and our agreement to acquire General Finance, which we expect to close midyear. We feel the time is right to allocate capital to attractive deals like these that meet our M&A criteria for a strong strategic, financial and cultural fit. 
With Franklin, we added 20 stores to our general rental footprint in the Central and Southeast regions. And the Franklin team is already on board, and I'll take this opportunity to officially welcome them to Team United. 
General Finance is a market leader in mobile storage and modular office rentals. And these services complement our current specialty and general offerings, and we're excited about the opportunity to unlock additional growth while showing more of our customers' needs with these new products. We'll be entering these markets with a strong presence and established footprint and a talented team with solid customer relationships, many of them new to our company. It's a textbook example of 1 plus 1 equaling more than 2. If you weren't able to join our earlier call on General Finance, we'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. 
Now let's pivot to demand, where we have more good news to share. The rebound we're seeing in our end markets is broadly positive. And this is true of our general rental business and even more so in our specialty segment. Specialty had another robust performance led by our power and HVAC business. Rental revenue for specialty moved past the inflection point and was positive year-over-year for the full quarter. And we're continuing to invest in growing our Specialty network with 6 cold starts year-to-date and another 24 planned this year. 
Now I'll drill down to our customers and our end markets. Customer sentiment continues to trend up in our surveys as the majority of our customers expect to see growth over the next 12 months. And importantly, the percent of customers who feel this way has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels. And we think there are a few reasons for this. For one thing, our customers have a significant amount of work in hand, and they can also see that our project activity is continuing to recover. The vaccines are rolling out, restrictions are easing in most markets and the weather is turning warmer, 3 positive dynamics converging right before our busy season. 
Also, we're seeing the return of activity in the manufacturing sector after more than a year of industrial recession. And the construction verticals that have been most resilient throughout COVID are still going strong, areas that we've discussed like technology and data centers, power, health care and warehousing and distribution. And with infrastructure, our customers are encouraged that it's back on the table in Washington. Most of the infrastructure categories and the administration's current proposal are directly in our wheelhouse, things like bridges, airport and clean energy. And we'll see how the process goes, but almost any infrastructure spending will benefit us in the long term, both directly and indirectly. 
Now there are some markets that are taking longer to recover, like energy. Most parts of the energy complex, including downstream, remains sluggish. And additionally, retail, office and lodging are largely in limbo. So while we're firing on all cylinders at United, there are pockets of the economy that are still catching up, and this means more opportunity for us down the road. 
I'll sum up my comments with this perspective. 2021 is shaping up to be a promising year. And our performance says a lot about our willingness to lean into that promise, whether it's with CapEx, M&A, cold starts or other strategic investments in the business. Our balance sheet and cash flow give us the ability to keep every option on the table. Throughout last year, we made the decision to retain capacity by keeping our branch network and our team intact. And now that the economic indicators are flashing green, our strategy is paying off by driving value for our people, our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. Over to you, Jess."

The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track. That strength carries through to our revised guidance and more",1064,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The strong start to the year is reflected in our first quarter results as rental revenue and used sales exceeded expectations and costs were on track. That strength carries through to our revised guidance and more on that in a few minutes. But let's start now with the results for the first quarter. 
Rental revenue for the first quarter was $1.67 billion, which was lower by $116 million or 6.5% year-over-year. And within rental revenue, OER decreased $117 million or 7.7%. In that, a 5.7% decline in the average size of the fleet was an $87 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $24 million, and fleet productivity was down 50 basis points or a $6 million impact. Sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 330 basis points, recovering a bit faster than we expected. Finishing the bridge on rental revenue this quarter is $1 million in higher ancillary and re-rent revenues. 
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger than expected in the quarter, coming in at $267 million. That's an increase of $59 million or about 28% year-over-year, led by a 49% increase in retail sales. The end market for used equipment remains strong. And while pricing was down year-over-year, it's up for the second straight quarter with margins solid at almost 43%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at around half its original cost. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $873 million, a decline of $42 million or 4.6% year-over-year. The dollar change includes an $84 million decrease from rental. In that, OER was down $86 million, while ancillary and re-rent together were an offset of $2 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, which offset a $2 million headwind from other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was a benefit in the quarter of $25 million. Similar to the last couple of quarters, the majority of that SG&A benefit came from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 42.4%, down 70 basis points year-over-year and flow-through as reported was about 62%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, as I mentioned in our January call, we'll have a drag in bonus expense during 2021 as we reset to our planned target. That reset started in the first quarter. Second, use sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a revenue mix headwind. Adjusting for those 2 results is an implied decremental flow-through for the quarter of about 37%. Across the core business, the first quarter's cost performance played out as we expected and reflects our continued discipline as we respond to increasing demand and as our costs continue to normalize. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $3.45. That's up $0.10 versus Q1 last year, primarily on lower interest expense and a lower share count. Quick note on CapEx. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was $295 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $267 million, resulting in net CapEx in Q1 of $28 million. 
Now turning to ROIC, which remains strong at 8.9%. As we look back over what's obviously been a challenging 12 months, one of the things that we're most pleased with is the ROIC we've generated, which has consistently run above our weighted average cost of capital through what was the trough of the down cycle. 
Free cash flow was also strong at $725 million for the quarter. This represents an increase of $119 million versus the first quarter of 2020 or about a 20% increase. As we look at the balance sheet, net debt is down 21% year-over-year, without having reduced our balance by about $2.3 billion over those 12 months. Leverage continues to move down and was 2.3x at the end of the first quarter. That compares with 2.5x at the end of the first quarter last year. 
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished the quarter with over $3.7 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $3.2 billion and availability on our AR facility of $276 million. We also had $278 million in cash. And since Matt mentioned our acquisitions earlier, I'll take a second here to note that we expect to fund the General Finance deal later this quarter with the ABL. 
Let's shift to our revised 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. This update does not include any impact from General Finance. If we close as expected in June, we'll update our guidance likely on our Q2 call in July to reflect the impact of that business. 
What is included in this update is mainly 3 things. First, the impact of higher rental revenue. Second, increased used sales capitalizing on a stronger-than-expected retail market. And third, the contribution of our Franklin Equipment acquisition, which we estimate at about $90 million of revenue and $30 million of adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year. 
We revised our current view to rental revenue given the start to the year and how we expect things to play out from here. The increase in our guidance reflects a range of possibilities with a growth opportunity over the remainder of the year largely follows normal seasonality, albeit from a higher starting point. And as you can see at midpoint, our updated guidance implies strong double-digit growth over the remaining 9 months of the year. 
A quick note on the guidance change in EBITDA and what hasn't changed in this revision, which is our continuing to manage costs tightly even as activity ramps more than forecasted. Our revised range on adjusted EBITDA considers that cost performance across the core business and reflects the impact of higher used sales and the Franklin acquisition, with margins and flow-through in line with our prior guidance. 
As certain of our costs continue to normalize from low levels in 2020, bonus expense remains the headwind we've discussed previously, and at midpoint is about a 60 basis point drag in margin year-over-year. Finally, the increase in free cash flow reflects the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned and remains robust at a midpoint of $1.8 billion.

And as far as customers being able to fill their own capital demands, I'm not really hearing that as a priority right now. It is early in the season. But I will say, if there's one area where the supply chain could impact, it would be on new sales, which is, by definition, a spot sale, a spot deal, right?

But as it's kind of in your markets and in your -- kind of what's in front of you, I mean the magnitude of some of these increases is pretty pronounced. And so I guess the question is a bit twofold. One is, if you look at the inflation that's hitting your customer base is at large and you kind of look at the CPI, so the prices they're selling relative to their PPI, that's been -- it's out of balance. So I'm trying to think how you -- how does that -- in the interplay with that with rental rates. And again, I know that's kind of -- we're not asking specifically about your rental rates. But I'm saying just in general, does this -- does a more inflationary backdrop help or hurt the opportunity from an industry, not United, but from an industry standpoint, from the standpoint of rental rates? 
And then more specific to your P&L. And I'm not asking about equipment inflation. I'm asking about inflationary pressures within -- just within cost of rent. What kind of pressure points are there? Obviously, labor is a big one, and you guys historically have managed that well.

And what could be an accelerated inflationary period looking forward for a bit, we'll see how that manifests. That would just up that need. And certainly, with all components of fleet productivity would be leaned upon to help drive that. And inflationary costs will be being absorbed by our customers. So they'll understand the dynamic. 
I think as far as what it does for the industry, when you think about cost of capital inflation, now that could drive some secular penetration for rental overall as an industry. We'd see that as a positive. People would -- it would just make what we think already pencils very well for a favorable look to rent versus own. It would even drive that gap and that help that we can give people even more so. So I'd say that would be a benefit for the industry.

So if I then shift to the cost side of it, as you mentioned, labor for sure is a consideration. And we've talked a lot about the merit increases that we do in the normal course across our business as one component of our contracts with our employees in addition to lots of other things like training and benefits and other support. 
And managing through merit increases and other inflationary costs that we would have by looking for offsets within efficiencies and productivities, whether it's leveraging our scale to tighten up on cost within the branch network, not unlike we've talked about in leaning more so on in-sourcing than the premium cost in outsourcing, things like delivery and repair. But also just working through the P&L on smarter ways that we can drive better efficiency in things like facility costs and utilities and things like that.

Now some of this was, let's say, where we're getting the comps into Q2 and Q3, where we had unnaturally low cost, where we're in like a shutdown mode, we won't go quite that far, but the learning of in-sourcing. And one of the ways we were able to retain the capacity we had on our team was to insource a lot of the work that we were outsourcing previously, both in R&M, in third-party delivery, longer haul transport for transfers. Those are learnings that I think we may be able to be more efficient longer term as the business gets back to operating at full capacity. 
And then unnecessary travel. I don't want us to go as far as nobody travels. I want us to get back to not just the team building, but getting back in front of our customers and building those relationships and selling the value in person. But we certainly have a lot of learnings that not only is -- that COVID taught us from a cost perspective, but also from a time management perspective, from an efficiency perspective. That would be another one that I think will certainly stick around in a lot of industries going forward. So those are the things I'd point to."

Thanks for joining us this morning.  Three months ago, we said that 2021 was shaping up to be a great year for United Rentals, and that's still very much the case.

Three months ago, we said that 2021 was shaping up to be a great year for United Rentals, and that's still very much the case. Our operating environment continues to recover. Our customers are increasingly optimistic about their prospects, and our company is continuing to lean into growth from a position of strength as a premium provider and our industry's largest one-stop shop.  
We're the supply leader in a demand environment, and we've leveraged that to deliver another consecutive quarter of strong results.  
The big themes of the second quarter are strong growth in line with our expectations and robust free cash flow, either after the step-up in our CapEx; positive industry indicators, including a strong used equipment market where pricing was up 7% year-over-year; the expansion of our go-to-market platform through M&A and cold starts. This is tied to the broad-based recovery in demand and our focus on operational discipline as we manage the increase in both volume and capacity while driving fleet productivity of nearly 18%.  
Another key takeaway is our safety performance, and I'm very proud of the team for holding the line on safety with another recordable rate below 1, while at the same time, managing a robust busy season and onboarding our acquired locations. This includes General Finance, which we acquired at the end of May.  
As you know, this was both a strategic and a financial move designed to build on our strengths. The acquisition expanded our growth capacity and gave us a leading position in the rental market for mobile storage and office solutions. The integration is going well. And while we still have more work to do, we're moving steadily through our playbook.  
As you saw in our release, we raised our outlook to include the expected impact of general finance and other M&A we closed since the first quarter. It also includes some additional investments we plan to make in CapEx that will serve us beyond 2021. This outlook follows the higher guidance we issued in April when we raised every range compared to our initial guidance. So as you can see, we're tenacious about pursuing profitable growth. And the investments we're making will still have a positive impact on our immediate performance as well as future years.  
And before Jeff gets into the numbers, I want to spend a few minutes on our operating landscape. Almost all of the challenges of 2020 have righted themselves. We have a better line of sight and so do our customers.  
When we surveyed our customers at the end of June, the results showed that over 60% of our customers expect to grow their business over the coming 12 months, which is a post-pandemic high. And notably, only 3% saw a decline coming over the same period.  
Customer optimism is a great barometer. And the trends that we see in the field support their view.  
2021 is a pivotal year for us. It confirms our return to growth, including our 19% rental revenue growth in the second quarter. I'll point to some of the drivers of that growth starting with geography.  
The rebound in our end markets continues to be broadly positive with all geographic regions  reporting year-over-year growth in rental revenue. Our specialty segment generated another strong performance with rental revenue topping 25% year-over-year, including same-store growth of over 19%. And importantly, we grew each major line of business by double digits, which underscores the broadness of the demand.  
For years now, our investment in building out our specialty network has been a key to our strategic positioning. These services differentiate our offering to customers and add resilience to our results throughout the cycles. And this is true of cold starts as well as M&A.  
This year, we've opened 19 new specialty branches in the first 6 months, which puts us well on our way to our goal of 30 by year-end. 
We're also investing in growth in our general rental segment where the big drivers are nonres construction and plant maintenance. Both areas are continuing to gain traction, and most of our end markets are trending up. Verticals like chemical process, food and beverage, metals and mining and health care all showing solid growth. And while the energy sector remains a laggard, it was up year-over-year for the first time in 8 quarters. 
We also have customers in verticals that are less mainstream, like entertainment, where demand for our equipment on movie sets and events more than doubled in the quarter. And while it's a relatively small part of the revenue, it's a good sign to see it come back. I also want to give you some color on project types. There are 2 takeaways, the diversity of the projects in Q2 and the fact that each region contributed to growth in its own way. The recovery has taken root across geographies and verticals on both coasts, with solid activity in heavy manufacturing, corporate campuses, schools and transmission lines. 
In this quarter, we're also seeing project starts in power, transit and technology. These job sites are using our gen rent equipment and our trench safety and power solutions. And fluid solutions are seeing a rebound in chemical processing and sewer bypass work as well as mining. These are just a few of the favorable dynamics in a very promising up cycle. And I want to put that in context. 
2020 was about the temporary loss of market opportunity, particularly in the second quarter. Now the pendulum is swinging back. And 2021 is about locking in that opportunity within the framework of our strategy. Our team is managing that extremely well. 
One proof point is our financial performance and the confidence we have in our guidance. 
Another is our willingness to lean into growth today to create outsized value tomorrow. And it's about more than CapEx and cold starts. We're constantly exploring new ways to capture growth by testing new products in the field, developing new sales pipelines and forging digital connections with customers. And finally, the most important proof point is the quality of our team. You can see that reflected in our safety record and our strong culture. Here's the thing to remember about 2021. 
This is still the early innings of the recovery. We're committed to capitalize on more and more demand as the opportunity unfolds, and we see a long runway ahead to drive growth, create value and deliver shareholder returns. 
Well, I'll stop here and ask Jess to go through the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Jess."

When we increased our 2021 guidance back in April, we expected a strong second quarter, supported by the momentum we were seeing to start the year. We're pleased to see that play out as anticipated with the second quarter results. And importantly, we're also pleased to see the momentum accelerate in our core business and support another raise to our guidance for the year. 
We've also added the impact from our acquisitions, notably the General Finance deal. And I'll give a little bit more color on our guidance in a few minutes, but let's start now with the results for the second quarter. 
Rental revenue for the second quarter was $1.95 billion. That's an increase of $309 million or 19%. If I exclude the impact of acquisitions on that number, rental revenue from the core business grew a healthy 16% year-over-year. 
Within rental revenue, OER increased $231 million or 16.5%. The biggest driver in that change was fleet productivity, which was up 17.8% or $250 million. That's primarily due to stronger fleet absorption on higher volumes, in part as we comped the COVID impacted second quarter last year. Our average fleet size was up 0.2% or a $3 million tailwind to revenue. And rounding out OER, the inflation impact of 1.5% cost us $22 million. 
Also within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $65 million or 31%, and re-rent was up $13 million. And we'll talk more about the increase in ancillary revenues in a moment. 
Used equipment sales came in at $194 million. That's an increase of $18 million or about 10%. Pricing at retail in the quarter increased over 7% versus last year and supported robust adjusted used margins of 47.9%. That represents a sequential improvement of 520 basis points and is 190 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. 
Used sales proceeds for the quarter represented a strong recovery of about 59% of the original cost of fleet that was on average over 7 years old. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $999 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year or $100 million. That included $13 million of onetime costs for acquisition activity. The dollar change includes a $141 million increase from rentals. In that, OER was up $125 million. Ancillary contributed $10 million, and re-rent added $6 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, and other non-rental lines of business provided $6 million. 
The impact of SG&A and adjusted EBITDA was a headwind for the quarter of $59 million, which came mostly from the resetting of bonus expense. 
We also had higher commissions on better revenue performance and higher discretionary expenses like T&E that continue to normalize. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 43.7%, down 270 basis points year-over-year, and flow-through as reported was about 29%.  
Let's take a closer look at margin and flow-through this quarter. Importantly, you'll recall that our COVID response last year included a swift and significant pullback in certain operating and discretionary costs. That was especially pronounced in the second quarter and is impacting flow-through this year as activity continues to ramp and costs continue to normalize. And we expect this will play through the rest of the year, notably in the third quarter. 
Specific to the second quarter, we've shared in previous calls that one of the costs that will reset this year is bonus expense from the low levels incurred last year. As a result, we had an expected drag in flow-through in the second quarter as we reset and now true up this year's expense. Flow-through and margins were also impacted as anticipated by acquisition activity, including the onetime costs I mentioned earlier. 
I also mentioned higher ancillary revenue in the second quarter, which represents in part the recovery of higher delivery costs. Delivery has been an area where we've seen the most inflation pressure, including higher cost for fuel and third-party hauling. And while recovering a portion of that increase in ancillary protected gross profit dollars, it impacted flow-through and margin this quarter as a pass-through. And we expect to see that play out over the next couple of quarters as well. 
Adjusting for these few items, the implied flow-through for the second quarter was about 46% with implied margins flat versus last year. With our expenses normalizing, that reflects the cost performance across the core that came in as expected. 
I'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $4.66 for the second quarter, including a $0.13 drag from onetime costs. That's up $0.98 versus last year, primarily on higher net income. 
Looking at CapEx and free cash flow. For the quarter, gross rental CapEx was a robust $913 million. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $194 million resulting in net CapEx in the second quarter of $719 million. That's up $750 million versus the second quarter last year. Even as we've invested in significantly higher CapEx spending so far this year, our free cash flow remained very strong at just under $1.2 billion generated through June 30. 
Now turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis. Notably, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of CapEx. 
Our balance sheet remains rock solid. Year-over-year, net debt is down 4% or about $454 million. That's after funding over $1.4 billion of acquisition activity this year with the ABL. Leverage was 2.5x at the end of the second quarter. That's flat to where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and an increase of 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter this year, mainly due to the acquisition of General Finance in May. 
A look at our liquidity, which is very strong. We finished the quarter with over $2.8 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just under $2.4 billion and availability on our AR facility of $106 million. We also had $336 million in cash. 
Moving forward, I'll share some color on our revised 2021 guidance. We've raised our full year guidance ranges at the midpoint by $350 million in total revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA as we now expect stronger double-digit growth for the core business in the back half of the year. Our current guidance also includes the impact of acquisition activity since our last update, predominantly to include General Finance. That increase for acquisitions reflects $250 million in total revenue and $60 million in adjusted EBITDA, which includes $15 million of expected full year onetime costs. 
Additional CapEx investment will help support higher demand. To that end, we raised our gross CapEx guidance by $300 million, a good portion of which reflects fleet we're purchasing from Acme Lift. While the fleet will provide some contribution in 2021 and is assumed in our guidance, we expect to see the full benefit next year. 
Finally, our update of free cash flow reflects the additional CapEx we'll buy as well as the puts and takes from the changes I mentioned. It remains a robust $1.7 billion at the midpoint, and we'll continue to earmark our free cash flow this year towards debt reduction to enhance the firepower we have to grow our business.

I think investors are wondering out there about how the margins can improve from current levels over the last, say, 4 years or so. We've seen steady degradation on the rental margins. In particular, even EBITDA margins have been under a little pressure. 
I'm just trying to think through like when you think of the 5 large acquisitions you've done over the last few years, right, starting with NES and kind of running through Gen Finance, at the time of acquisition, you bought over, you say about $2.25 billion of revenues, and those EBITDA margins were only 38, right? And you used to run high 40s. So I appreciate that's a lot of revenue you bought that's dragging down the margin. 
But when I look at the business today, moving forward, how do we think about the rental margin structurally if you want to leave that all the way into EBITDA? But really, in particularly the rental margins, is this as much about just a shift towards specialty might lower margins, but improve returns on capital? Just so we can kind of level set how we should think about not just top line growth, growing earnings, but margins."

Thanks for taking a longer-term view of this because that's really how we manage and see the business. And although we have some short-term pressures when we acquire businesses that come in at lower margins, if you look over our experience of these acquired assets and what we've done with the businesses pro forma, it validates why we do M&A. We feel we can be a better owner. We could bring more value to those assets. 
If it drops EBITDA margin for a period of time, that's one metric, but we also are very focused and quite frankly, model our M&A deals on returns. So -- and our returns continue to be well above our cost of capital. 
So I don't think rental margin degradation is a concern for us. We'll continue to drive fleet productivity to overcome natural inflationary costs as well as efficiencies in our operations. And we think that's how we've taken these businesses that are in the 30s yet maintain mid-40s depending on the time of the year to higher EBITDA margin, and that's what we do, right?

But just to give a little bit of color behind what's implied. And I'll start with my normal call out not to anchor to the midpoint here. But let me use the midpoint just to give some color behind those -- the bonus dynamic and even some of the acquisitions impact that we'll have in the back half. 
So if I use the margin at the midpoint, the back half implied margin would be down about 120 basis points for us, and that's going to generate flow through again at midpoint of about 39%. So think about margins, 46.2%. That one headwind is going to continue for us, more so in the third quarter than in the fourth as we think about the comp to last year, where the bonus was, I'll call it, abnormally low, right, just lower than normal. 
So if you think about that bonus headwind as well as the anticipated headwinds in flow-through and margin that we get from the acquisition activity that margin goes from down 120 basis points to up 40 basis points or a margin implied in the back half at midpoint of 47.8% from 46.2%. Flow-through in that at the midpoint, about 50%, adjusting for those 2 items. 
So those obviously will be an impact for us. And as you mentioned, the quarterly dynamic will play out. If you just think about the comps we have against the belt tightening that we did last year, the third quarter will be -- will have more flow-through pressure than you'll see in the fourth. 
And then the other thing I just want to mention in the third quarter just to be helpful in the modeling is third quarter last year, we had $20 million of onetime benefits from insurance recoveries and absolutely not expected to repeat."

As far as fleet profile changes, I don't -- I'll hazard a guess to say 80% of the fleet that we would use to support and that we do use to support infrastructure is core fleet. So we have very fluid fleet and very fungible fleet to support this vertical.

But outside of that, most of what we serve that end market with is core fleet of our very fungible assets.

And then on -- as you think about the volatility that we've seen this year and not just in terms of just commodity costs and how that's impacting equipment and some of your supply cost, but as well as the just the availability of new fleet from the OEMs. 
Is that -- do you expect that will influence how you'll approach the timing as you get closer to that initial planning, in terms of CapEx planning for '22 as well as maybe how you're thinking about used sales? And perhaps maybe flex that fleet age higher? And I'm sure there's a push and pull here. But if the used market is -- if it remains as strong as it is, which obviously will depend somewhat on new supply availability. But does that impact how you're, again, thinking, one, about the timing, the initial budgeting for next year, and then two, just how you're thinking about managing the fleet in this environment of super tight used  markets?"

This -- you'll see a little bit play out in Q3 as it did in Q2. The used metering, to use a word to characterize what you're saying, is more about just timing utilization, right? As we continue to drive high demand and high use of our assets, then they're not as available to sale. But the end market is strong there. So I think we'll continue to fill that demand versus a fleet. I don't think that's necessary. 
And on the first part, on the supply side, we've got some really good partners from good suppliers out there, and I think they'll get their arms wrapped around these supply chain disruptions that everybody has been dealing with in every industry. But commodities probably will rightsize a little bit as we get to the end of this year. I'm assuming that our vendors are working -- I'm not assuming. I've talked to them, working really hard to continue to improve any supply chain disruptions they had. 
So I'm not really seeing that as a barrier to us supporting our customers next year. If it is, we'll adjust. But we're not -- that's not in our calculus right now and certainly not to age the fleet."

So we understand the noise. Maybe it's our relationships, maybe it's our scale and leverage. But we've been able to exceed when we sat here in January, what we originally expected to purchase this year. 
So I think that's a good story. And I get the challenges that everybody has, but we've got what we want. Yes, there's been some slippage. And if you ask me within a quarter, if stuff comes in a few weeks later, absolutely. The team worked through it. We drove higher fleet productivity on the assets that we had. And this is part of those strong supply/demand and industry dynamics that I referred to in the earlier question about fleet productivity. So nothing that's inhibited us supporting customers but something we'll continue to talk to our suppliers at how can we help them help us. And that's how we'll look at it going forward."

How much outside of your replacement of your rental used to life assets are you going to add? So 70% of the answer is there for them already, maybe more in some years, if you're not growing a lot. 
So we'll get through the planning process to see how we work through this year, but we don't see a need to actually lock in deals with who -- which vendor is going to supply what.

So a couple of questions there, so I'll break it down to stuff about the Acme to clear up any misunderstanding. So within that $300 million of gross CapEx improvement, anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of that, we've been telling people are going to be the Acme assets. The reason why that's not a definitive number is that we are going to buy these throughout the rest of the year. Those assets -- a lot of them that we don't have right now came off -- has to come off rent from where they are, had to be serviced and delivered to us in rent-ready good condition. And if they're not, we won't buy them. 
So where that ends up, we'll know a lot more when we all talk at the end of October by then. Hopefully, we're primarily done. But because this is so back-half-loaded on the receipt of these assets, that's why you wouldn't see the normal correlating CapEx acquisition revenue impact that you'd see, let's say, if we brought them in, in the second quarter. So I think that's what was referred to there. 
And that opportunity came organically. We've had a relationship with them for many, many, many years. And they're changing their model, and we saw it as an opportunity to buy assets that fit our profile very well. So that's how that came up. 
Your second question, I call it the build-versus-buy conversation. We absolutely have a dual-pronged approach from our strategy. As you know, M&A has been a big part of our business. I would even call the Franklin acquisition, part of a build versus buy. We thought we had opportunity to do a better job in the markets they're operating in, and there was an opportunity to do that one, an acquisition versus cold starts. But we're not going to wait just for the perfect deal to come along for us to have organic growth plans, whether it's in specialty or markets where we think we have more opportunities within the overall portfolio in gen rent. 
So it's an analysis we do as part of our pipeline, that build versus buy conversation, and we'll continue to look at it that way."

And now that we're in the peak season, outside services were necessary. But longer term, I view this as an opportunity for us. 
The recruiting of drivers is probably the one area, not just for our industry, I think my trash pickup was a little late last month because they didn't have a driver to pick up. It's a problem for everybody. It's not going to be forever. So longer term, I think this is an opportunity for us to continue to drive even more efficiency in our business by in-sourcing things that we were doing. 
And as far as the labor market and overall, we're doing pretty well outside of being able to hire more drivers and even get trucks fast enough. 
I would say the rest of our labor situation, we feel really good about. Part of it is our low turnover. So we're not having to replace as many as if we had higher turnover. And frankly, part of it is a decision we made to not do layoffs. So thank goodness, we didn't do that because it would be really tough right now if we had mass layoffs during COVID and then still had to support this level of activity.

Thanks for joining us. As we look back on the past year, I feel that 2020 was a proven ground for our company. It gave us the opportunity to prove the resiliency of our business model and the disciplines",1247,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
As we look back on the past year, I feel that 2020 was a proven ground for our company. It gave us the opportunity to prove the resiliency of our business model and the disciplines we've engineered for more than a decade: things like capital management, cost management, operational agility and the willingness of our team to embrace change. We've demonstrated these capabilities during choppy periods in the past, but last year wasn't just a downturn, it was a sharp and significant economic disruption. And we stood up to those conditions while keeping our people safe, streamlining our operating costs, aggressively flexing our CapEx and managing our excess capital to reduce leverage.  In addition, we kept our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to within 50 basis points of 2019, despite significantly lower market demand, and we generated record free cash flow. 
And now, things are getting better. Most of our end markets have been on a steady path to recovery since the third quarter, and we saw that continue in Q4.  These factors help us narrow the gap in rental revenue year-over-year from being down over 13% in Q3 to down just 10% in Q4. And as you saw yesterday, our fourth quarter results were better than our guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
I was also pleased that throughout 2020, we stayed laser-focused on execution, while remaining flexible and agile in a very fluid environment. And most importantly, we never wavered from our fierce determination to take great care of our employees and our customers. 
We didn't resort to reactive cuts in our service capacity that would harm our customer service or slow us down in the upcycle or impact our long-term earnings power. Early on, we committed to keeping the key in the ignition on capacity so we could start the engine up at any time. And as we enter '21, this has proven to be the right decision. 
The execution of that decision rests squarely with our people, and they have consistently delivered. They're the reason why our safety reportable rate remained below 1 for all 4 quarters of 2020. And it's a credit to their professionalism that our COVID protocols were adopted so quickly company-wide, allowing us to serve our customers safely.  And the financial results you saw yesterday were generated by the talent and commitment of our people all working together as one UR. It's an exceptional team, and I'm very proud to work beside them. 
Now let's look forward to the current year. 
COVID isn't a traditional cycle, but it's a cycle nonetheless. And we believe it will continue to have an impact for the foreseeable future. As our guidance indicates, we'll continue to gain ground in '21 as we work our way back towards pre-COVID levels.  Our sentiment echos the majority of our customers in our recent surveys, the comments we hear from the field and other external data points we've collected. We're optimistic of the year, while being realistic that visibility is still somewhat limited.  
What our guidance doesn't show is the cadence of demand this year. But once we lapped the first quarter, our toughest comp will be behind us, and then we expect to return to growth as we move through '21.  And we base this on a couple of factors. 
The recent spike in COVID cases is projected to settle down in the coming months, which should help reactivate some projects that were temporarily halted. And as the vaccines are rolled out, business confidence should continue to improve. And this will provide a tailwind for both capital projects and MRO spending. And as demand trends up, we're well positioned to be first call for our customers. 
And before I get into our operating environment, I want to mention our fourth quarter revenue from used equipment sales. It was $275 million, almost 13% higher than prior year, and it was driven by healthy retail demand. And as you know, we look at the strength of the used equipment market as a key indicator for the rental industry. And when the retail market is favorable, it tells us that contractors are projecting needs for that fleet. 
Another positive indicator is that our industry overall showed great discipline on the supply side in 2020, and this is a good place to be as activity ramps up. 
Looking at our operating environment, there are some encouraging signs. The verticals we called out as most resilient on our last call are continuing to lead project activity in markets like power, health care, distribution and technology. Within these verticals, we're looking at a range of jobs, including data centers, hospitals, warehouses and even power plants. 
And on the other side of the ledger, petrochem continued to be soft in the fourth quarter. The good news is that we're seeing light at the end of the COVID tunnel, and we expect this sector to do better this year led by scheduled turnaround activity in downstream and chemical process. 
Within non-res, which is our largest revenue base, a number of new projects broke put ground in the fourth quarter and others plan to start up this year. These include some big stadium projects that were postponed when COVID hit.  And the same is true of airport construction and renovation. We see a number of these multiyear projects back on the table. And to a lesser degree, road and bridge work, which generally has remained steady.  
Infrastructure has been topical since the election. And while the details and the timing are unknown at this point, President Biden has been clear that this will be a priority for his administration. And as the economy continues to heal, United Rentals is in a strong position to benefit from any increase in end market spending, including infrastructure. And we've invested for years in positioning the company for this type of scenario. 
Our specialty segment had another good quarter, led by our power and HVAC business, which generated fourth quarter same-store revenue that was higher than the prior year. It underscores the importance of our ongoing investments in specialty operations. In total, we plan to open another 30 specialty cold starts this year, which is double the number that we opened last year. And this will bring us close to 400 specialty locations by December. 
Here's the main point of my comments this morning. You may recall our mantra that figure doesn't really matter unless we're constantly driving for better. And the way we get there is by doing what we say we're going to do. 2020 did its best to challenges on that, but we came through for all of our stakeholders, and the learnings we gained from that experience have been incorporated into our operations. And we'll leverage these learnings as we return to growth. 
Finally, we said we would fulfill our responsibility to investors by protecting the long-term earnings power of the business, and we're doing that, too. The takeaway from 2020 isn't what went wrong in the external environment, it's what went right when we committed to a course of action and met our goals. Yesterday, you saw the results of that commitment. And today, we're telling you that we intend to deliver again in '21. 
So I'll stop here and ask Jess to take you through the numbers, and then we'll go to Q&A. So Jess, over to you."

Our financial results in the fourth quarter were better than we expected, with rental volumes continuing to recover and strong used sales activity at retail, and more on both in a minute.  Costs were in line and",1031,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 
Our financial results in the fourth quarter were better than we expected, with rental volumes continuing to recover and strong used sales activity at retail, and more on both in a minute.  Costs were in line and supported by -- supported solid margins in the quarter. Free cash flow for the year also exceeded expectations, and our leverage at year-end was down versus 2019. That's all good news as we move into 2021. 
I'll provide some color on our '21 guidance before we get to Q&A. Let's start now with the results for the quarter. 
Rental revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.85 billion, which was lower by $208 million or 10.1% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER decreased $190 million or 10.9%. In that, a 5.6% decline in the average size of the fleet was a $98 million headwind to revenue. Inflation of 1.5% cost us another $25 million, and fleet productivity was down 3.8% or a $67 million impact.  Sequentially, fleet productivity improved by a healthy 420 basis points, mainly from better fleet absorption. Rounding out the decline in rental revenue for the quarter was $18 million in lower ancillary and re-rent revenues. 
As I mentioned earlier, used equipment sales were stronger-than-expected in the quarter, coming in at $275 million. That's an increase of $31 million or about 13% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by an increase in retail sales. That reflected OEC sold up 35% year-over-year in the retail channel for the second quarter in a row. 
Used margins in the quarter were solid at 42.5%. Notably, these results in use reflect our selling over 7-year-old fleet at just shy of 50% of original cost. 
Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $1.04 billion, a decline of $117 million or 10.1% year-over-year. The dollar change includes a $143 million headwind from rental. And in that, OER made up $140 million and ancillary and re-rent together were the remaining $3 million. Used sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $11 million, which offset a $3 million headwind from our other non-rental lines of business. And SG&A was another benefit in the quarter of $18 million, with the majority of that help coming from lower discretionary costs, mainly T&E. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 45.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year, and flow-through as reported was about 66%. I'll mention 2 items to consider in those numbers. First, used sales made up a greater portion of our revenue this quarter, which was a headwind to margin and flow-through. 
Second, I mentioned on our Q3 call, back in October, that we had a benefit in bonus expense in Q4 2019 that would cause a drag this Q4. Adjusting for those 2 items implies a margin of 46.1% and flow-through for the quarter of just over 56%. Both results were largely as expected and pointed to continuing cost discipline even as certain operating costs started to normalize. 
A quick comment on adjusted EPS, which was $5.04 That compares with $5.60 in Q4 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower net income from lower revenue. 
Let's move to CapEx. For the quarter, rental CapEx was $176 million, bringing our full year spend to $961 million in gross rental CapEx, which was 55% less than what we spent in 2019. Proceeds in 2020 from used equipment sales were $858 million, resulting in net CapEx of $103 million. 
ROIC remained strong at year-end, coming in at 8.9%. That continues to meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital, which currently runs about 7%. Year-over-year, ROIC was lower by 150 basis points, primarily due to the decline in revenue.  
Turning to free cash flow, which was a record for us at over $2.4 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of over $860 million versus 2019. As we look at the balance sheet, our having dedicated the majority of our free cash flow to debt reduction in 2020 resulted in a $1.9 billion or almost 17% decrease year-over-year in net debt. Leverage was 2.4x at year-end, down from 2.6x at the end of 2019. 
Liquidity remains extremely strong. We finished 2020 with just under $3.1 billion in total liquidity. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.7 billion and availability on our AR facility of $166 million. We also had $202 million in cash. 
Let's shift to our 2021 guidance, which we included in our press release last night. Our view to total revenue includes a return to growth in rental revenue with the season, starting in April. We look forward to getting past the challenging comp in Q1 as we lapped the start of the pandemic and move to delivering rental growth for the rest of the year. Our guidance includes a range of outcomes given our seasonal patterns and assumptions we've made on the pace of continuing recovery across our end markets. We're planning for another strong year in used sales, and we'll look to increase our CapEx spend to replace that fleet. 
Within our guidance, that reflects over $1.9 billion in replacement CapEx. Beyond that, we continue to be focused on absorbing the fleet we own, and we'll adjust our growth capital accordingly with total spend planned at pre-COVID levels. 
Our range on adjusted EBITDA considers not only the volume growth we expect in revenue, but also our continuing to manage costs tightly. We'll leverage what we've learned in 2020 using our own capacity to support our customers with less reliance on third-parties. As our business continues to recover, we'll also see a reset of costs that ran low in 2020, such as T&E and bonuses. 
Finally, one of the best indicators of the strength of our business model is the resiliency of our cash flow, especially as we invest behind growth. In 2021, we expect another year of generating significant free cash flow, and that's after considering a return to over $2 billion in CapEx spending. We'll continue to use our free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce our leverage.

We're not quite there yet, but a heck a lot closer than I would have thought. So I think we're already in pretty good shape. And now it's just about the opportunities that we can lean into. And we do see growth headroom over the next few years. 
This year may be a little less than what we'll see in the future years, but I'll also say that this headline growth that -- let's use the midpoint of 3.5% is a little bit misleading because it's having to absorb what is a tough comp in Q1.

There's a couple of things I'd point to. First of all, within non-res, there are certainly winners and losers. And the ability we have to -- and we're planning for this, to outpace the end market growth is by using those fungible assets and moving them from the weaker market to the stronger markets. So that's always been our mantra. And I'd say the rental industry overall usually has the opportunity and the ability to outpace the end market growth. And you'd see that historically.

So we feel good overall about the backdrop stabilizing, and we think with the scale and size that we have, that we'll be able to outpace the end market growth."

And that will -- I won't use the word, stabilize. That negative will decrease throughout the year. Our cadence -- think about our cadence as being a normal capital spend cadence, maybe a little lighter in Q1. As you could see from our fleet productivity, we still have some extra capacity to absorb. But when we get into the peak seasons, starting Q2 and Q3, that's where we typically spend 75% to 80% of our CapEx in the year.  
It's also important to note that we plan on selling $1.7 billion worth of fleets in '21 because of the robustness of the end market, and that's a great way to not only take care of our customers that want to buy fleet, but refresh our feet. So when you inflation adjust that, that's $1.95 billion of replacement capital. So depending on where we end up in the range, you have anywhere from $50 million to $350 million of growth capital. And we'll meter it in as we earn it, as we absorb it and we see the opportunity."

So all end markets have the opportunity geographically, but it's just thinking about things that are struggling, like as you could imagine, anything travel-related, anything entertainment-related, lodging. I'm certainly not expecting us to be on any hotel projects as we get through '21.
And then even retail, right? So we're a little worried about retail. But on the flip side of that, when we get back to the winners, distribution and warehousing and logistics are hot right now because that's how consumers are buying products. So that's just an example of where we can move our fleet out of what might be retail growth and into warehouse and distribution growth. And this is the flexibility of the model with a very fungible asset. 
So geographically broad, and I think we could all talk to the markets that are winning and losing: health care, technology, pharma. Probably what people may not realize this power has been strong, not just conventional power plants, but even solar and wind. So there's plenty of work out there, we feel, to fortify this guidance."

We'll still have negative fleet productivity here in Q1. We've already told you guys about the tough comps. So think about that in a high-single-digit range tough comp in Q1. And what that portends then once we get past the comp in Q2. You model that against our midpoint of 3.5% and you see some significant growth. And that will play through fleet productivity similarly. So we think that, that all portends to great opportunity and absorption remains our opportunity. Once we do that, we'll start to meter in the growth CapEx, as I had said earlier. 
As far as mix, mix is an output, right, to what the customers end up renting from us. To your point, we could have more broad usage in petrochem if that comes back than maybe we had this year, and that could help.

For us, it's less about the finite calculation or what the impact is as much as it is continuing to optimize the way that we're managing the ebbs and flows of activity through each of the branches.  So as we're thinking about that going forward, it's a benefit that in our business has impacted the gen rent and the specialty segment.

So I just -- the actual cadence of the progression of the improvement of the business seasonally is really -- we don't plan on that being too different.

So first off, on the retail, admittedly, it surpassed our expectations, but on new sales -- and it was driven by retail. And the reason that is very important, is because I've been doing this 30 years, I will promise you there's no contractor that's going to buy a piece of equipment to sit in the dark. So it underlies what we're seeing in our customer confidence index, what we're hearing from our teams, that our customers are going to have work.  So that's first and foremost. 
I think what we've done that's unique is we've built that retail sales engine direct to customers versus relying on trades or auctions, and that's really benefited us. We are pleasantly surprised as well. As far as the viability of it, well, if it just grew this year, the back half of this year was 35% over a very robust '19, I don't see how it would continue on as activity picks up, as demand overall picks up. So we feel good about the resiliency there.  And it's a great way to refresh the fleet. 
The repositioning I mean, we'll -- it's what we do. We manage the business. It's part of the advantage of having a very broad end market we serve in a very broad geography. So we don't have to move because our network is so dense. We don't have to move equipment across the country. So the repositioning, it happens on a daily basis. And it's really just moving it to where the customer needs. And it's not something that we're pulling out any exceptional costs or anything like that for."

I'll actually use the midpoint even though I usually -- my standard is not to anchor to the midpoint. I'll use the midpoint right now just to walk through.
If I think about flow-through at the midpoint for guidance, it is 31.5%. We -- the biggest costs that will reset in the business in 2021 are our bonuses. And that is going to be about a $50 million headwind at target, and that translates into about 50 basis points of margin. So absent that bonus reset margins at the midpoint year-over-year would actually be flat.  And then from a closing perspective, if I adjust for that same $50 million, it's a flow-through ex-bonus of about 50%.  So that's the largest one factor I would point out. 
The other factor I'd point out is the resetting of some of the other costs. So we mentioned T&E. I would also say some of the variable costs that will flex with the increase in the activity and just getting the business back to a normal flow of operating costs that's also built into the guidance and the flow-through that you see. We haven't quantified or really identified beyond some of the obvious ones, right, like T&E, some of our professional fees, we haven't quantified what that looks like. We've built into our range expectations of some of those costs coming back at a slightly higher pace than the overall revenue growth in the year."
