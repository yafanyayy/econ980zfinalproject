It's great to be here and I hope everyone's families are safe and healthy. Through the magic of PCR testing made possible by Visby Medical here in the Bay Area, through masks, safe distancing and being outside and some gorgeous San Francisco day, I am here together sitting at the table with Amy Weaver, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bret Taylor, our Chief Operating Officer; Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer; Evan, and Mark Hawkins, our CFO Emeritas. So it's great to be here with everybody. 
And we haven't really done an outside conference call before, but welcome to the new pandemic world that we are in and we're going to make this work. So this is a reminder. We are definitely in a new place, and we can see the beginning of return to our offices. In fact, I was in Salesforce Tower yesterday and held our global All-Hands Call. We can see a return to restaurants to maybe even the sports arenas and to concerts 1 day, who knows? We're getting closer with all of the advancements in technology. 
But the reality is that even with the vaccines, we're not really back to the way it was, and I was the only 1 in the Ohana floor at Salesforce Tower. And we can all, I think, agree that this pandemic has forever changed our world and how we are working and living and educating ourselves and for [indiscernible] 
Our Salesforce futurist, Peter Schwartz, who many of you know, probably said it recently to me best when he said, ""We're just in a new pandemic world."" And as this is going to evolve and shift, we don't know exactly but we're going to kind of make it work. And that's the idea of being outside here during our earnings call. It's an all digital, it's work from anywhere world where every company and every earnings call. We have to be able to work, sell, service, market, collaborate and analyze our data from anywhere. 
And Salesforce was somehow already built for this world before it existed. That's why over the last year, Salesforce has become, I think, significantly more strategic and more relevant to our customers than probably any time before. And today, 22 years after founding of Salesforce, we can see it right here that more and more companies around the globe are turning to Salesforce to deliver success from anywhere. And that's why even in the midst of the global pandemic, we had such an incredible year and an incredible quarter, and you can see it in these incredible numbers. And that by delivering success from anywhere, our revenue rose to more than $5.8 billion, up 20% year-over-year, truly amazing for a company of our size. 
And for the full fiscal year '21, revenue was $21.25 billion, which was up 24% year-over-year. Based on this strong fiscal year '21 results, we're raising our FY '22 guidance to $25.75 billion, which is now at the high end of our range, representing 21% projected growth year-over-year. There's never been a software company over $20 billion in revenue that is growing as fast as we are. And as we shared at our Investor Day last year, our long-term revenue target for the fiscal year '26 is now $50 billion or basically, we're going to double the company from where we are right now. That is doubling revenue in 5 years, and we'll reach that milestone faster than any other enterprise software company. That would make Salesforce the second largest independent software company in the world, amazing. 
This is all really a testament to our employees and our customers and the technology, and really, this amazing ecosystem of all of this together and the millions of trailblazers who are working from anywhere and pioneering success from anywhere. I'm often asked, how is it that we're able to succeed in such a difficult time? And I'll tell you, Salesforce is accelerating at such a rapid speed because we are already in this work from anywhere world. We're achieving success from anywhere. For us, success starts with our core values. And for those of you who followed our company for a long time, when these things happen, when the world changes, we always pivot hard back to our core values. 
And trust is our #1 value. There's never been a more important time when trust in government and other institutions, well, we can see it's been eroding, and customers are seeking direct customer digital relationships. And I think that as the world has evolved, especially in last year, the acceleration of these direct B2B and B2C digital relationships for our customers, it's more important than ever before because we're in a world of all of this mistrust. So that is why this Customer 360 platform is more important than ever and that's why it's so important. 
And customer success, well, we're helping our customers navigate the pandemic and achieve success from anywhere, you can see that. I'm going to talk to you in a second about some tremendous innovations with our Vaccine Cloud and our contact tracing capability and innovation. Well, you can see it. We're innovating, well, faster than ever before, developing these amazing new products. And all these incredible new technologies and a quality we're helping and executing philanthropy and working together across all of these communities, especially our schools, hospitals, small businesses and the most vulnerable populations get through what have been some of these incredibly difficult times. 
Our values have guided us as we've pivoted to this new pandemic world. And like every year, we came into it with a business plan. But early on, about a year ago, in fact, we knew that business plan was not going to hold together. We devised a whole new business operating model for how we run Salesforce and how we would succeed from anywhere. We called that our Pandemic Operating Model. We sharpened our relevance, increased our levels of participation, enabled our employees, created new types of sales plays. 
And I shared our model with many CEOs that I've talked to over the last several months and now they're applying it to their own organizations and getting incredible new levels of performance out of it as well. As we dialed into the model, we immediately saw our team's level of relevance, participation and skyrocket. For example, from Q2 to Q4, our own enterprise sales teams, even though they were at home, used our Sales Cloud to engage in more than 6 million conversations with customers, asking how we can be the most relevant and useful them in a time of crisis. I don't think we would have survived as a business without our Sales Cloud. It was critical to build those business-to-business relationships that are the essence of Salesforce but that we had to do digitally. And Sales Cloud enabled us to sell from anywhere. And throughout the year, we helped other great companies that you've heard about like AT&T or Insperity or Line or 3M or so many others to do the same. 
And we all -- of course, we all love getting on the airplanes and flying somewhere and being in person with the customer but it just hasn't been possible. Now if you look at the magic of our Marketing Cloud, well, we were able to create new digital experiences like Dreamforce, and I hope all of you had the opportunity to experience Dreamforce. But we have the ability to use our Marketing Cloud to have those direct digital relationships at scale. And instead of having 170,000 people take over San Francisco, we had more than 140 million views of just Dreamforce. That's amazing. 
We also created hundreds of other leadership events throughout the year for customers, employees, partners, communities, and that generated another 300 million -- 350 million views. In the year, customers like Zoom, like Carrefour, Humana and so many others also chose the Marketing Cloud to fuel their digital business growth as well. 
And with Service Cloud, while we managed our own case load as our business continued to accelerate through the year, as we moved our call centers and contact centers into our employees' homes with 4.8 billion interactions using our Service Cloud in the last quarter. Customers, in the year, like Gap and Sonos and even Uber Eats, who use Service Cloud to power success from their customers from anywhere. 
Now as a customer, Slack, I can tell you, we're using Service Cloud with Slack to improve performance. We've seen a 26% improvement in case times and close rates and 19% improvement in same-day resolution. That's an example where our acquisition of Slack has made so much sense. We've seen the combination of products like Service Cloud and Slack together just make it so much better for us as a company or for our customers, and we're looking forward to doing so much more of that. 
Slack can be the central nervous system for any company, connecting its people and data across systems, apps and devices from anywhere. It's really an enabler of success from anywhere. And once our merger is approved, we're going to build Slack into more of these products that we have used today and conceptualize and make our customers even more productive. We're going to create the most open and interoperable ecosystem of apps and workflow and enterprise software. 
By achieving success from anywhere at Salesforce, we're delivering success from anywhere to our customers. In many ways, we're becoming the success from anywhere company. Whether it's B2B or B2C, our customers need to accelerate their efforts to go all digital, to build direct customer relationships with their customers. And for so many companies, it's a matter of their survival. 
With the flexibility, scale and time to value of Customer 360, our customers are able to quickly adapt to this new world. And on any given day, our customers are generating 3 million Commerce Cloud transactions. Well, that's up 100% from a year ago. That's not a surprise to anybody. We all know, we're shopping from anywhere and creating 4 million sales opportunities working from anywhere, their home, a coffee shop, the mountaintop or delivering an average of 2.9 billion marketing messages from anywhere across any digital channel, logging nearly 5 billion case interactions servicing from anywhere. 
Now Salesforce Einstein, which is our core artificial intelligence capability, really built in the heart of Customer 360, well, that's now delivering more than 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day, 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day across our entire Customer 360, amazing. Customer 360 makes all of our customer interactions smarter than ever before and it's a great example why Salesforce has been ranked by IDC as the #1 CRM for the seventh year in a row. 
It's just the fourth quarter so companies are turning to Salesforce to build trusted relationships with their customers and deliver success from anywhere. Companies like I mentioned, like Align or Telstra or Dixons or Marriott or RBC or Cigna or Sports United, across so many industries, across so many geographies, companies, large companies or small and medium companies, even brands like IQVIA and Deluxe, well, they turned to MuleSoft, which is critical to every digital transformation, to connect to all of their legacy systems and connect that data from anywhere. 
And of course, right now, delivering success from anywhere also is managing the pandemic from anywhere. By developing technology like contact tracing, Work.com, well, you see in Salesforce.com is at the forefront of helping organizations and governments back the pandemic or in the case of the state of Victoria in Australia, well, basically eradicate it. And with Vaccine Cloud, we're helping cities like New York or states like where I am right now, in California, or other entire countries, scale of vaccine operations and get vaccine shots and. 
And I have to tell you, I've just never seen a logistics, and information technology challenge like this before. And our technology is working incredibly well. And you've seen some other implementations of technology in this area. Well, did not work well for these vaccines. So now we can see that more than 50 federal, state, local and private health organizations are using Salesforce to manage this incredible response to pandemic. Cities like Austin and Chicago, New York City, California, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, I mean, it really goes on and on. 
More than 245 million people, in fact, have used COVID-19 data through our Tableau dashboards, and thousands of organizations are relying on Tableau's COVID-19 data hub, such as Verizon and U&C or Unicef or experience, and you can check that out at public.tableau.com or just go to tableau.com and you'll see a whole tab just on their response to COVID-19. That's been incredible with what our team at Tableau has done. 
The pandemic has shifted us all into the work from anywhere world but it's just the beginning of a whole new era. And that's why we're so excited about what we have done and how we have transformed our own organization and our technology with Hyperforce. Look, we've built an incredible new platform. You heard about it at Dreamforce for the first time. This Hyperforce platform, well, this is a fundamental new architecture for us. It lets us run on any hyperscaler. Hyperforce allows us to run anywhere. And that allows our customers to choose where they want to manage their data. 
That's allowed us to open incredible new data centers in India and Germany, and we're planning to support another 10 new additional countries this year and all built on this incredible new architecture. And it's 100% compatible with all our previous implementations. It's another example of how well we're going to be able to help our customers achieve success from anywhere. 
Now finally, when we are successful, we have responsibility to others. It means we can be living examples of stakeholder capitalism in action. And it's why during the pandemic, we've accelerated our efforts to serve all stakeholders, including our communities and the planet. We supported frontline workers in 300 hospitals around the world by delivering over 50 million pieces of PPE. We've provided millions of dollars and grants to schools to help with remote learning, to local small businesses to stay afloat, and to organizations focused on racial justice as that turned into a crisis here in our United States. 
And we've partnered with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, an equitable distribution of vaccines across 190 countries. I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to fight climate change and protect our planet. In fact, we are a net 0 operations company today, and we've also reduced our carbon emissions by 40% in the last year. With our Sustainability Cloud, companies across the globe are tracking and reducing their carbon emissions and keeping track of their critical ESGs. We're supporting the global movement to conserve, to restore and grow 1 trillion trees as the founders of the World Economic Forum, 1t.org initiative, and I'm very grateful for everyone who has done so much to help this critical part of climate change with sequestration. 
All of which shows why when we truly serve all stakeholders, business is the greatest platform for change. Well, that's where Salesforce is today and where we're going. It's a new business operating model, work from anywhere, direct trusted customer relationships. You can see this incredible product line, all built on this Hyperforce architecture, serving all stakeholders is how Salesforce is achieving success from anywhere, and it's how we're enabling our customers to achieve success from anywhere. I'm incredibly proud and grateful for what we've been able to accomplish in fiscal year '21. 
And I'm very proud of us even though we're freezing out here in San Francisco but we're outside and doing it safely. We've all been PCR tested. It's all totally fine. And now I'm turning it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Amy Weaver, Amy?"
122917,703287409,2224286,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and I agree.

But at least it's brisk, this is great. So I'm thrilled to be here today in this new role. I've really enjoyed the opportunity to meet with and learn from many of our shareholders during the transition period, and I'm looking forward to getting to know more of the investment community during fiscal '22. 
So as Marc described, we closed out our fiscal '21 with another quarter of outstanding growth at scale and solid bottom line execution. So let me take you through some of the results for Q4 and fiscal '21. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.82 billion, up 20% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. For the full fiscal '21, revenue was $21.25 billion, up 24% year-over-year in both dollars and constant currency. This was a well-rounded performance across geographies and service product offerings. 
Revenue attrition in Q4 was between 9% and 9.5%, which was slightly favorable versus our Q3 guidance assumption. Our continued focus on customer success has resulted in attrition rates better than we had assumed each quarter since the onset of the pandemic. However, our Q4 attrition rate is still higher than where we finished a year ago. 
Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract, ended Q4 at approximately $36.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18 billion, up 20% or 18% in constant currency. 
Turning to operating margin. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5%. This includes a $184 million real estate impairment charge. As a reminder, our guidance for Q4 had assumed $80 million to $100 million in real estate charges. During the quarter, we identified further opportunities to consolidate and sublease across our global portfolio, including in some of our hub locations. 
For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 17.7%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. The upside from our guidance was largely driven by revenue outperformance and partially offset by the incremental real estate charges that I just referenced. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.28 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.04. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.22. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered $4.8 billion of operating cash flow, up 11% over last year. This number was slightly lower than our guidance for the year, which was driven by the growth investments discussed in previous calls as well as by timing of collections at the end of the quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $149 million, leading to free cash flow of $2 billion, up 35% year-over-year. 
Now turning to guidance for Q1 and fiscal '22. As a result of our Q4 performance, we are raising our Q1 revenue guidance by $170 million to $5.875 billion to $5.885 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes a $40 million contribution from Acumen Solutions due to an earlier acquisition closing date of February 1. 
Additionally, please note that MuleSoft will contribute to higher sequential revenue than historical norms in Q1 due to certain contracts that closed in Q4 but have start dates beginning in Q1. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $200 million to $25.65 billion to $25.75 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes $190 million from Acumen, and subject to closing, $600 million from Slack. For Q1, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '22 of 17.7% or flat year-over-year. We're pleased to keep the margins flat despite an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investments in our core business and the anticipated gradual increase of travel in the second half of fiscal '22. 
I do want to call out that the real estate consolidation mentioned earlier will have a positive impact on the longer-term P&L. But at this point, we do not see a material benefit in fiscal '22. We expect GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal '22 of negative $0.44 to negative $0.42 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.39 to $3.41. We expect recent M&A will be a $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASCO 2016-01. 
We expect fiscal '22 operating cash flow growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year. Note that this includes the expected dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen, which we expect to represent a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 9 points. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 10% to 11% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A noted above, this rate would be 21% to 22%. 
To close, in a year far different from what we ever could have expected, Salesforce delivered durable top line growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion and took important steps on our path to $50 billion by reimagining our business and setting ourselves up for success from anywhere. I'm extremely proud of the way that our employees navigated the challenges of fiscal '21 with grace, resilience and with an unwavering commitment to our values and to our customers. 
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our community and especially our shareholders for their continued support. And with that, Michelle, let's open up the call for questions."

Broadly, I think we're seeing just incredible secular trends towards digital. I've heard a lot of CEOs just talk about essentially, we did in a year what might have taken a decade before in terms of adoption of digital technology. And when all of your customer and your partner and your employee interactions are digital, artificial intelligence and Einstein can make every single one of those engagements more personal. 
To put some numbers on it, I'll just take Service Cloud as an example. Our digital service capability has grown at just unprecedented rates this year. And with the adoption of things like chatbots powered by Einstein, we saw 91% quarter-over-quarter growth in chatbots alone. Our Marketing Cloud, which is just every single 1 of those interactions is personalized. If you looked at Cyber Week this past quarter, mobile push notifications were up 131% year-over-year. SMS was up 171% year-over-year. You're seeing just unprecedented adoption of digital. 
And the thing Marc covered in his opening remarks, I think, is really important. And a big part of our thesis as a company is we're not going back. The people who have experienced all these digital trends, whether it's buy online, curbside pickup, that direct-to-consumer trend in the consumer packaged goods industry, the move to telemedicine. One of the customers Marc mentioned, Humana. One of the things they're doing with our platform is Humana Care Support which is this digital interaction between its members, its care teams, as provider communities. All of these trends are here to stay. 
And when we think about Einstein, we think about our platform broadly. We really think that we're looking, over the next 5 years, how can we help every single 1 of our customers across all these industries, gain success from anywhere and Einstein is a huge part of that vision."

I've been surprised how many sales calls we've been able to make this year. And if I could rewind history over the last 22 years, I would have enforced a much more significant digital discipline for our sales organization. I think that when we look back at all of the time and energy we spent physically getting on airplanes, going -- getting them cars, going to people's offices, having a breakfast or a lunch or a dinner, waiting to try to get up and make a C-level sales call, when you look today at the level of access that you have in organizations to conduct B2B sales, I mean, it's all the capability. 
When you're digitally enabled, you can go anywhere just much, much faster. And that's a key reason why with Dreamforce, not only did we have a very successful Dreamforce from our park. And you probably saw the video with Bret and I. But also we then told each of our sales executives all over the world, that they were going to have to do that. Same presentation but highly customized with highly customized demonstrations for each and every one of our customers, which we then did. 
And customers warmly received that with large groups of their employees. So it's really an example of you can do a lot more to build pipeline, have direct access and deliver highly customized selling at a level of velocity that I don't think previously was possible. Gavin, do you want to comment on that as well?"

That's the overriding theme that we've seen over the last 9 months. Previously, it might have been delegated down into the business, but it has become so important and so urgent that the CEO wants to take direct control over it. And that has been something we've been able to take advantage of. 
And coupled with the fact that video allows us to get to see and make us faster and more frequently, it means that the pipeline has been very strong. So you had a question about the deal complexity and changes. It's been strong across the board, so we've done big deals. But the run rate business, the volume side of the business continues to be strong as well. And it's important that both these muscles continue to operate within our business model. So it's a very well-rounded performance in that respect. 
And you've rightly identified. Time-to-value is, I think, probably even more important now for decision-makers. And this is a theme that I know certainly, Bret and I have been on calls and is right at the forefront of the CEO' an the CEO's decision-making. So the more we can ensure that standard Salesforce solutions are deployed and they're configured in a standard way to ensure that we can get fast deployment, I think, is really, really important. So we're agile, we're getting the right sort of conversations, and the pipeline is strong across the board."

I was joking with Marc the other day that David Schmaier has forgotten more about CRM than most people know. He's been in this industry for decades and is truly an expert. And our strength as a company is that we are experts in our lines of business. We want to help people sell from anywhere, service from anywhere, market from anywhere, do digital marketing from anywhere. 
But we are increasingly experts in industries. And now, thanks to both our organic strategy and our acquisition of Vlocity, we're at 12 industries that we serve across so many strategic verticals for our customers. And you heard our focus, which is really helping our customers in this all-digital work anywhere world, find success, find success from anywhere. 
And so much of that is really industry-specific. Every industry is going through a very accelerated digital transformation. In consumer goods, as Marc said, it's about creating direct trusted customer relationships, which is a completely new digital motion that requires new expertise, new software, new -- and candidly, just a new business model. 
In areas like health care, you've seen the impact this year. Retail, obviously, Cyber Week has accelerated, again, by almost a decade worth of acceleration this year. And when I think about our ability to really provide success from anywhere, it's really building in those industry-specific processes so they work out of the box. As Gavin and I mentioned, we do a lot of calls together, and that time to value discussion is the first thing that comes up. And our vertical solutions are a big part of it because it means we essentially are starting all of our customers on third base with the industry-specific processes that are important to them. So really grateful for David's leadership and really grateful for the alignment between our product strategy and our distribution and sales strategy that this vertical effort gives us."

It seems like every year, you get to the fourth quarter and the big deals, the ELAs, the big digital transformation, a lot of those do show up in the fourth quarter. I would imagine, over the last several years, the nature of those transformations have changed. 
Given this has been such a wild and unusual year, would love to hear what you're hearing from the field, like customers are talking about that's different in the way that they're going about their digital transformations. Perhaps is more MuleSoft, more Tableau or maybe even talking about messaging and engagement? I know it's an open-ended question, but some more anecdotal evidence from the field on big deals would be great."

I think one of the major transformations that's happened this year, and I think you can really see it and you peer into the numbers is when we actually sell to our customers, we're selling our Customer 360 platform. 
And we have Sales Cloud. You're right. We have Service Cloud. We have Marketing Cloud. We have Commerce Cloud. We have this amazing Tableau. It's incredible, multibillion-dollar analytics cloud, and we have this amazing MuleSoft integration cloud, billion-dollar Integration Cloud and a reskilling platform and our services business and our partnerships and the full ecosystem of solutions. 
But when customers are coming and working with us, and if I'm working with a CEO, a fellow CEO, maybe one of these very large companies, they're not as interested in some discrete cloud. I'm sure you could probably appreciate that they are really interested in deploying our platform. And we have a lot of different words to describe these different parts of our code. But the reality is that they really just want us to make them successful. 
And when we look at some of the very large implementations that we've done this year, we're quick to say, ""Well, we fully implemented all of these AT&T retail stores with our Sales Cloud,"" but the reality is that when you talk to Jeff McElfresh, who we featured at Dreamforce, who's the CEO of AT&T Wireless, mostly, he just wants to know that he's more productive, more competitive, more innovative and that he is able to have better customer relationships and that all of his employees are aligned. 
And that's what we're really starting to sell. And I think that, that's a powerful transformation of our company. And I think it really started when we -- the successful really acquisition of Tableau. It started to get customers to be able to look at us just much more strategically. It wasn't that we onboarded this incredibly successful analytics business that we did. But it was really that we, all of a sudden, have a truly strategic solution for customers that's quite broad and that gives them a platform for success. 
And then when you look at the pandemic, it's transformed to the platform for success from anywhere. So yes, we're going to let them sell from anywhere or service from anywhere or market from anywhere, but we're going to let them be successful from anywhere and that is really our platform. We used to call it, if you remember, the Customer Success platform. So now we really should just be calling it the Success from Anywhere platform. 
Anyway, I'm going to have Bret and Gavin chime in here because I think that you're touching on probably one of the most powerful transformational moments for Salesforce. And it's also, honestly, it's one of the main reasons that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Slack because it's an enablement of success from anywhere."

If you had told me 1.5 years ago that we would execute this entire year without being in an office, without getting on an airplane, I would have said it was impossible. But we did do it and we did it without any notice. And every executive in every company, including ours coming out of this is really asking the question, what is the company we want to be on the other side of it? What sales meetings are going to get on an airplane for? Is that contact center that used to be a building that is now something that exists in the cloud, are we going to go back to the building or just embrace the cloud? 
And I think it really everywhere, and when we were in Singapore and talking to a bunch of companies that had reopened, what stood out to me and Marc was actually how many of the pandemic behaviors actually remained. And I think that's a really interesting glimpse of the future. And you're seeing it across our customer base. There's this concept called Flexible Work that every single sales meeting in, it comes up, which is waiting our employees going back to the office. And notably,  employees aren't going back to the office. And I think it's a really interesting time for digital technology. 
But as you said, I think it's a really interesting time to think about what the future work looks like. And it's part of what drew us to Slack and that company's vision for the future because it's not just the digital translation of the way we used to work. It's truly a vision for a new way to work.

Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business acquisitions, results of operations and financial condition and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  
A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call to Marc."

Through the magic of PCR testing made possible by Visby Medical here in the Bay A",2686,"All right. Well, thank you very much, Evan, and thank you, everybody, for being on the call today. It's great to be here and I hope everyone's families are safe and healthy. Through the magic of PCR testing made possible by Visby Medical here in the Bay Area, through masks, safe distancing and being outside and some gorgeous San Francisco day, I am here together sitting at the table with Amy Weaver, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bret Taylor, our Chief Operating Officer; Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer; Evan, and Mark Hawkins, our CFO Emeritus. So it's great to be here with everybody.  
And we haven't really done an outside conference call before, but welcome to the new pandemic world that we are in and we're going to make this work. So this is a reminder. We are definitely in a new place, and we can see the beginning of return to our offices. In fact, I was in Salesforce Tower yesterday and held our global all-hands call. We can see a return to restaurants to maybe even the sports arenas and to concerts one day, who knows? We're getting closer with all of the advancements in technology.  
But the reality is that even with the vaccines, we're not really back to the way it was, and I was the only one in the Ohana Floor at Salesforce Tower. And we can all, I think, agree that this pandemic has forever changed our world and how we are working and living and educating ourselves from anywhere.
Our Salesforce futurist, Peter Schwartz, who many of you know, probably said it recently to me best when he said, ""We're just in a new pandemic world."" And as this is going to evolve and shift, we don't know exactly but we're going to kind of make it work. And that's the idea of being outside here during our earnings call. It's an all-digital, it's work-from-anywhere world where every company and every earnings call. We have to be able to work, sell, service, market, collaborate and analyze our data from anywhere.  
And Salesforce was somehow already built for this world before it existed. That's why over the last year, Salesforce has become, I think, significantly more strategic and more relevant to our customers than probably any time before. And today, 22 years after founding of Salesforce, we can see it right here that more and more companies around the globe are turning to Salesforce to deliver success from anywhere. And that's why even in the midst of the global pandemic, we had such an incredible year and an incredible quarter, and you can see it in these incredible numbers. And that by delivering success from anywhere, our revenue rose to more than $5.8 billion, up 20% year-over-year, truly amazing for a company of our size.  
And for the full fiscal year '21, revenue was $21.25 billion, which was up 24% year-over-year. Based on this strong fiscal year '21 results, we're raising our fiscal year '22 guidance to $25.75 billion, which is now at the high end of our range, representing 21% projected growth year-over-year. There's never been a software company over $20 billion in revenue that is growing as fast as we are. And as we shared at our Investor Day last year, our long-term revenue target for the fiscal year '26 is now $50 billion or basically, we're going to double the company from where we are right now. That is doubling revenue in 5 years, and we'll reach that milestone faster than any other enterprise software company. That would make Salesforce the second largest independent software company in the world, amazing.  
This is all really a testament to our employees and our customers and the technology, and really, this amazing ecosystem of all of this together and the millions of trailblazers who are working from anywhere and pioneering success from anywhere. I'm often asked, how is it that we're able to succeed in such a difficult time? And I'll tell you, Salesforce is accelerating at such a rapid speed because we are already in this work-from-anywhere world. We're achieving success from anywhere. For us, success starts with our core values. 
And for those of you who followed our company for a long time, when these things happen, when the world changes, we always pivot hard back to our core values. And trust is our #1 value. There's never been a more important time when trust in government and other institutions, well, we can see it's been eroding, and customers are seeking direct customer digital relationships. 
And I think that as the world has evolved, especially in last year, the acceleration of these direct B2B and B2C digital relationships for our customers, it's more important than ever before because we're in a world of all of this mistrust. So that is why this Customer 360 platform is more important than ever and that's why it's so important.  
And customer success, well, we're helping our customers navigate the pandemic and achieve success from anywhere, you can see that. I'm going to talk to you in a second about some tremendous innovations with our Vaccine Cloud and our contact tracing capability and innovation. Well, you can see it. We're innovating, well, faster than ever before, developing these amazing new products. And all these incredible new technologies and a quality we're helping and executing philanthropy and working together across all of these communities, especially our schools, hospitals, small businesses and the most vulnerable populations get through what have been some of these incredibly difficult times.  
Our values have guided us as we've pivoted to this new pandemic world. And like every year, we came into it with a business plan. But early on, about a year ago, in fact, we knew that business plan was not going to hold together. We devised a whole new business operating model for how we run Salesforce and how we would succeed from anywhere. We called that our pandemic operating model. We sharpened our relevance, increased our levels of participation, enabled our employees, created new types of sales plays. 
And I shared our model with many CEOs that I've talked to over the last several months and now they're applying it to their own organizations and getting incredible new levels of performance out of it as well. As we dialed into the model, we immediately saw our team's level of relevance, participation and enable skyrocket. For example, from Q2 to Q4, our own enterprise sales teams, even though they were at home, used our Sales Cloud to engage in more than 6 million conversations with customers, asking how we can be the most relevant and useful them in a time of crisis. I don't think we would have survived as a business without our Sales Cloud. It was critical to build those business-to-business relationships that are the essence of Salesforce but that we had to do digitally. And Sales Cloud enabled us to sell from anywhere. And throughout the year, we helped other great companies that you've heard about like AT&T or Insperity or Align or 3M or so many others to do the same.  
And we all -- of course, we all love getting on the airplanes and flying somewhere and being in person with the customer but it just hasn't been possible. Now if you look at the magic of our Marketing Cloud, well, we were able to create new digital experiences like Dreamforce, and I hope all of you had the opportunity to experience Dreamforce. But we have the ability to use our Marketing Cloud to have those direct digital relationships at scale. And instead of having 170,000 people take over San Francisco, we had more than 140 million views of just Dreamforce. That's amazing.  
We also created hundreds of other leadership events throughout the year for customers, employees, partners, communities, and that generated another 300 million -- 350 million views. In the year, customers like Zoom, like Carrefour, Humana and so many others also chose the Marketing Cloud to fuel their digital business growth as well.  
And with Service Cloud, while we managed our own case load as our business continued to accelerate through the year, as we moved our call centers and contact centers into our employees' homes with 4.8 billion interactions using our Service Cloud in the last quarter. Customers, in the year, like Gap and Sonos and even Uber Eats, who use Service Cloud to power success from their customers from anywhere.  
Now as a customer, Slack, I can tell you, we're using Service Cloud with Slack to improve performance. We've seen a 26% improvement in case times and close rates and 19% improvement in same-day resolution. That's an example where our acquisition of Slack has made so much sense. We've seen the combination of products like Service Cloud and Slack together just make it so much better for us as a company or for our customers, and we're looking forward to doing so much more of that. Slack can be the central nervous system for any company, connecting its people and data across systems, apps and devices from anywhere. It's really an enabler of success from anywhere. And once our merger is approved, we're going to build Slack into more of these products that we have used today and conceptualize and make our customers even more productive. We're going to create the most open and interoperable ecosystem of apps and workflow and enterprise software.  
By achieving success from anywhere at Salesforce, we're delivering success from anywhere to our customers. In many ways, we're becoming the success from anywhere company. Whether it's B2B or B2C, our customers need to accelerate their efforts to go all digital, to build direct customer relationships with their customers. And for so many companies, it's a matter of their survival. With the flexibility, scale and time to value of Customer 360, our customers are able to quickly adapt to this new world. And on any given day, our customers are generating 3 million Commerce Cloud transactions. Well, that's up 100% from a year ago. That's not a surprise to anybody. We all know, we're shopping from anywhere and creating 4 million sales opportunities working from anywhere, their home, a coffee shop, the mountaintop or delivering an average of 2.9 billion marketing messages from anywhere across any digital channel, logging nearly 5 billion case interactions servicing from anywhere.  
Now Salesforce Einstein, which is our core artificial intelligence capability, really built in the heart of Customer 360. Well, that's now delivering more than 93 billion, 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day, 93 billion AI-powered predictions every single day across our entire Customer 360, amazing. Customer 360 makes all of our customer interactions smarter than ever before and it's a great example why Salesforce has been ranked by IDC as the #1 CRM for the seventh year in a row.  
It's just the fourth quarter so companies are turning to Salesforce to build trusted relationships with their customers and deliver success from anywhere. Companies like I mentioned, like Align or Telstra or Dixons or Marriott or RBC or Cigna or Sports United, across so many industries, across so many geographies, companies, large companies or small and medium companies, even brands like IQVIA and Deluxe, well, they turned to MuleSoft, which is critical to every digital transformation, to connect to all of their legacy systems and connect that data from anywhere. 
And of course, right now, delivering success from anywhere also is managing the pandemic from anywhere. By developing technology like Contact Tracing, Work.com, well, you see in Salesforce.com is at the forefront of helping organizations and governments speed back the pandemic or in the case of the state of Victoria in Australia, well, basically eradicate it. And with Vaccine Cloud, we're helping cities like New York or states like where I am right now, in California, or other entire countries, scale of vaccine operations and get vaccine shots in arms. And I have to tell you, I've just never seen a logistics, and information technology challenge like this before. And our technology is working incredibly well. And you've seen some other implementations of technology in this area. Well, did not work well for these vaccines. So now we can see that more than 50 federal, state, local and private health organizations are using Salesforce to manage this incredible response to pandemic. Cities like Austin and Chicago, New York City, California, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, I mean, it really goes on and on. 
More than 245 million people, in fact, have used COVID-19 data through our Tableau dashboards, and thousands of organizations are relying on Tableau's COVID-19 data hub, such as Verizon and UNC or UNICEF or experience, and you can check that out at public.tableau.com or just go to tableau.com and you'll see a whole tab just on their response to COVID-19. That's been incredible with what our team at Tableau has done. 
The pandemic has shifted us all into this work from anywhere world but it's just the beginning of a whole new era. And that's why we're so excited about what we have done and how we have transformed our own organization and our technology with Hyperforce. Look, we've built an incredible new platform. You heard about it at Dreamforce for the first time. This Hyperforce platform, well, this is a fundamental new architecture for us. It lets us run on any hyperscaler. Hyperforce allows us to run anywhere. And that allows our customers to choose where they want to manage their data. 
That's allowed us to open incredible new data centers in India and Germany, and we're planning to support another 10 new additional countries this year and all built on this incredible new architecture. And it's 100% compatible with all our previous implementations. It's another example of how well we're going to be able to help our customers achieve success from anywhere. 
Now finally, when we are successful, we have responsibility to others. It means we can be living examples of stakeholder capitalism in action. And it's why during the pandemic, we've accelerated our efforts to serve all stakeholders, including our communities and the planet. We supported frontline workers in 300 hospitals around the world by delivering over 50 million pieces of PPE. We've provided millions of dollars and grants to schools to help with remote learning, to local small businesses to stay afloat, and to organizations focused on racial justice as that turned into a crisis here in our United States. 
And we've partnered with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, on equitable distribution of vaccines across 190 countries. I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to fight climate change and protect our planet. In fact, we are a net 0 operations company today, and we've also reduced our carbon emissions by 40% in the last year. With our Sustainability Cloud, companies across the globe are tracking and reducing their carbon emissions and keeping track of their critical ESGs. We're supporting the global movement to conserve, to restore and grow 1 trillion trees as the founders of the World Economic Forum, 1t.org initiative, and I'm very grateful for everyone who has done so much to help this critical part of climate change with sequestration. 
All of which shows why when we truly serve all stakeholders, business is the greatest platform for change. Well, that's where Salesforce is today and where we're going. It's a new business operating model, work from anywhere, direct trusted customer relationships. You can see this incredible product line, all built on this Hyperforce architecture, serving all stakeholders is how Salesforce is achieving success from anywhere, and it's how we're enabling our customers to achieve success from anywhere. I'm incredibly proud and grateful for what we've been able to accomplish in fiscal year '21. 
And I'm very proud of us even though we're freezing out here in San Francisco but we're outside and doing it safely. We've all been PCR tested. It's all totally fine. And now I'm turning it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Amy Weaver. Amy?"
122917,703287409,2224539,"salesforce.com, inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and I agree.

I've really enjoyed the opportunity to meet with and learn from many of our",981,"Thanks, Marc, and I agree. It's a little surprising to be doing my first call outdoors. But at least it's brisk, this is great. So I'm thrilled to be here today in this new role. I've really enjoyed the opportunity to meet with and learn from many of our shareholders during the transition period, and I'm looking forward to getting to know more of the investment community during fiscal '22. 
So as Marc described, we closed out our fiscal '21 with another quarter of outstanding growth at scale and solid bottom line execution. So let me take you through some of the results for Q4 and fiscal '21. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.82 billion, up 20% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. For the full fiscal '21, revenue was $21.25 billion, up 24% year-over-year in both dollars and constant currency. This was a well-rounded performance across geographies and service product offerings. 
Revenue attrition in Q4 was between 9% and 9.5%, which was slightly favorable versus our Q3 guidance assumption. Our continued focus on customer success has resulted in attrition rates better than we had assumed each quarter since the onset of the pandemic. However, our Q4 attrition rate is still higher than where we finished a year ago. 
Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract, ended Q4 at approximately $36.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18 billion, up 20% or 18% in constant currency. 
Turning to operating margin. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5%. This includes a $184 million real estate impairment charge. As a reminder, our guidance for Q4 had assumed $80 million to $100 million in real estate charges. During the quarter, we identified further opportunities to consolidate and sublease across our global portfolio, including in some of our hub locations. 
For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 17.7%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. The upside from our guidance was largely driven by revenue outperformance and partially offset by the incremental real estate charges that I just referenced. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.28 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.04. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.22. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered $4.8 billion of operating cash flow, up 11% over last year. This number was slightly lower than our guidance for the year, which was driven by the growth investments discussed in previous calls as well as by timing of collections at the end of the quarter. CapEx for the quarter was 145 -- $149 million, leading to free cash flow of $2 billion, up 35% year-over-year. 
Now turning to guidance for Q1 and fiscal '22. As a result of our Q4 performance, we are raising our Q1 revenue guidance by $170 million to $5.875 billion to $5.885 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes a $40 million contribution from Acumen Solutions due to an earlier acquisition closing date of February 1. 
Additionally, please note that MuleSoft will contribute to higher sequential revenue than historical norms in Q1 due to certain contracts that closed in Q4 but have start dates beginning in Q1. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $200 million to $25.65 billion to $25.75 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This includes $190 million from Acumen, and subject to closing, $600 million from Slack. For Q1, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '22 of 17.7% or flat year-over-year. We're pleased to keep the margins flat despite an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investments in our core business and the anticipated gradual increase of travel in the second half of fiscal '22. 
I do want to call out that the real estate consolidation mentioned earlier will have a positive impact on the longer-term P&L. But at this point, we do not see a material benefit in fiscal '22. We expect GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal '22 of negative $0.44 to negative $0.42 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.39 to $3.41. We expect recent M&A will be a $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. 
We expect fiscal '22 operating cash flow growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year. Note that this includes the expected dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen, which we expect to represent a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 9 points. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 10% to 11% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A noted above, this rate would be 21% and 22%. 
To close, in a year far different from what we ever could have expected, Salesforce delivered durable top line growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion and took important steps on our path to $50 billion by reimagining our business and setting ourselves up for success from anywhere. I'm extremely proud of the way that our employees navigated the challenges of fiscal '21 with grace, resilience and with an unwavering commitment to our values and to our customers. 
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our community and especially our shareholders for their continued support. And with that, Michelle, let's open up the call for questions."

Broadly, I think we're seeing just incredible secular trends towards digital. Yes, I've heard a lot of CEOs just talk about essentially, we did in a year what might have taken a decade before in terms of adoption of digital technology. And when all of your customer and your partner and your employee interactions are digital, artificial intelligence and Einstein can make every single one of those engagements more personal. 
To put some numbers on it, I'll just take Service Cloud as an example. Our digital service capability has grown at just unprecedented rates this year. And with the adoption of things like chatbots and -- powered by Einstein, we saw 91% quarter-over-quarter growth in chatbots alone. Our Marketing Cloud, which is just every single one of those interactions is personalized. If you looked at Cyber Week this past quarter, mobile push notifications were up 131% year-over-year. SMS was up 171% year-over-year. You're seeing just unprecedented adoption of digital. 
And the thing Marc covered in his opening remarks, I think, is really important. And a big part of our thesis as a company is we're not going back. The people who have experienced all these digital trends, whether it's buy online, curbside pickup, that direct-to-consumer trend in the consumer packaged goods industry, the move to telemedicine. One of the customers Marc mentioned, Humana. One of the things they're doing with our platform is Humana Care Support which is this digital interaction between its members, its care teams, its provider communities. All of these trends are here to stay. 
And when we think about Einstein, we think about our platform broadly. We really think that we're looking, over the next 5 years, how can we help every single one of our customers across all these industries, gain success from anywhere and Einstein is a huge part of that vision."

I've been surprised how many sales calls we've been able to make this year. And if I could rewind history over the last 22 years, I would have enforced a much more significant digital discipline for our sales organization. I think that when we look back at all of the time and energy we spent physically getting on airplanes, going -- getting in cars, going to people's offices, having a breakfast or a lunch or a dinner, waiting to try to get up and make a C-level sales call, when you look today at the level of access that you have in organizations to conduct B2B sales, I mean, it's all -- the capability, when you're digitally enabled, you can go anywhere just much, much faster. 
And that's a key reason why with Dreamforce, not only did we have a very successful Dreamforce from our park. And you probably saw the video with Bret and I. But also we then told each of our sales executives all over the world that they were going to have to do that. Same presentation but highly customized with highly customized demonstrations for each and every one of our customers, which we then did. 
And customers warmly received that with large groups of their employees. So it's really an example of you can do a lot more to build pipeline, have direct access and deliver highly customized selling at a level of velocity that I don't think previously was possible. Gavin, do you want to comment on that as well?"

That's the overriding theme that we've seen over the last 9 months. Previously, it might have been delegated down into the business, but it has become so important and so urgent that the CEO wants to take direct control over it. And that has been something we've been able to take advantage of. 
And coupled with the fact that video allows us to get to see and make us faster and more frequently, it means that the pipeline has been very strong. So you had a question about the deal complexity and changes. It's been strong across the board, so we've done big deals. But the run rate business, the volume side of the business continues to be strong as well. And it's important that both these muscles continue to operate within our business model. So it's a very well-rounded performance in that respect. 
And you've rightly identified. Time-to-value is, I think, probably even more important now for decision-makers. And this is a theme that I know certainly, Bret and I have been on calls and is right at the forefront of the CEO and the CTO's decision-making. So the more we can ensure that standard Salesforce solutions are deployed and they're configured in a standard way to ensure that we can get fast deployment, I think, is really, really important. So we're agile, we're getting the right sort of conversations, and the pipeline is strong across the board."

I was joking with Marc the other day that David Schmaier has forgotten more about CRM than most people know. He's been in this industry for decades and is truly an expert. And our strength as a company is that we are experts in our lines of business. We want to help people sell from anywhere, service from anywhere, market from anywhere, do digital marketing from anywhere. 
But we are increasingly experts in industries. And now thanks to both our organic strategy and our acquisition of Vlocity, we're at 12 industries that we serve across so many strategic verticals for our customers. And you heard our focus, which is really helping our customers in this all-digital work anywhere world find success, find success from anywhere. 
And so much of that is really industry-specific. Every industry is going through a very accelerated digital transformation. In consumer goods, as Marc said, it's about creating direct trusted customer relationships, which is a completely new digital motion that requires new expertise, new software, new -- and candidly, just a new business model. 
In areas like health care, you've seen the impact this year. Retail, obviously, Cyber Week has accelerated, again, by almost a decade worth of acceleration this year. And when I think about our ability to really provide success from anywhere, it's really building in those industry-specific processes so they work out of the box. 
As Gavin and I mentioned, we do a lot of calls together, and that time-to-value discussion is the first thing that comes up. And our vertical solutions are a big part of it because it means we essentially are starting all of our customers on third base with the industry-specific processes that are important to them. So really grateful for David's leadership and really grateful for the alignment between our product strategy and our distribution and sales strategy that this vertical effort gives us."

It seems like every year, you get to the fourth quarter and the big deals, the ELAs, the big digital transformation, a lot of those do show up in the fourth quarter. I would imagine, over the last several years, the nature of those transformations have changed. 
Given this has been such a wild and unusual year, would love to hear what you're hearing from the field, like customers are talking about that's different in the way that they're going about their digital transformations. Perhaps it's more MuleSoft, more Tableau or maybe even talking about messaging and engagement. I know it's an open-ended question, but some more anecdotal evidence from the field on big deals would be great."

But I think one of the major transformations that's happened this year, and I think you can really see it and it appears into the numbers is when we actually sell to our customers, we're selling our Customer 360 platform. 
And we have Sales Cloud. You're right. We have Service Cloud. We have Marketing Cloud. We have Commerce Cloud. We have this amazing Tableau. It's incredible, multibillion-dollar analytics cloud. And we have this amazing MuleSoft integration cloud, billion-dollar integration cloud and a reskilling platform and our services business and our partnerships and the full ecosystem of solutions. 
But when customers are coming and working with us, and if I'm working with a CEO, a fellow CEO, of maybe one of these very large companies, they're not as interested in some discrete cloud. I'm sure you could probably appreciate that they are really interested in deploying our platform. And we have a lot of different words to describe these different parts of our code. But the reality is that they really just want us to make them successful. 
And when we look at some of the very large implementations that we've done this year, we're quick to say, ""Well, we fully implemented all of these AT&T retail stores with our Sales Cloud,"" but the reality is that when you talk to Jeff McElfresh, who we featured at Dreamforce, who's the CEO of AT&T Wireless, mostly, he just wants to know that he's more productive, more competitive, more innovative and that he is able to have better customer relationships and that all of his employees are aligned. 
And that's what we're really starting to sell. And I think that, that's a powerful transformation of our company. And I think it really started when we had the successful acquisition of Tableau. It started to get customers to be able to look at us just much more strategically. It wasn't that we onboarded this incredibly successful analytics business with what we did. But it was really that we, all of a sudden, have a truly strategic solution for customers that's quite broad and that gives them a platform for success. 
And then when you look at the pandemic, it's transformed to the platform for success from anywhere. So yes, we're going to let them sell from anywhere or service from anywhere or market from anywhere, but we're going to let them be successful from anywhere and that is really our platform. We used to call it, if you remember, the Customer Success platform. So now we really should just be calling it the Success from Anywhere platform. 
Anyway, I'm going to have Bret and Gavin chime in here because I think that you're touching on probably one of the most powerful transformational moments for Salesforce. And it's also, honestly, it's one of the main reasons that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Slack because it's an enablement of success from anywhere. Okay. Bret?"

If you had told me 1.5 years ago that we would execute this entire year without being in an office, without getting on an airplane, I would have said it was impossible. But we did do it and we did it without any notice. And every executive in every company, including ours coming out of this is really asking the question, what is the company we want to be on the other side of it? What sales meetings are we going to get on an airplane for? Is that contact center that used to be a building that is now something that exists in the cloud, are we going to go back to the building or just embrace the cloud? 
And I think it really, everywhere, and when we were in Singapore and talking to a bunch of companies that had reopened, what stood out to me and Marc was actually how many of the pandemic behaviors actually remained. And I think that's a really interesting glimpse of the future. And you're seeing it across our customer base. There's this concept called flexible work that every single sales meeting I'm in, it comes up, which is when our employees going back to the office. And notably, when employees aren't going back to the office. And I think it's a really interesting time for digital technology. 
But as you said, I think it's a really interesting time to think about what the future work looks like.

Amy and I were in our offices on Monday and San Francisco together on our Ohana floor and it just was an emotional moment to know that we're back and that our Hana are back in the offices and that we're opening back up. This is just a critical time. So it's an amazing quarter, and it's just apposed against pandemic is not over everywhere, but it's starting to be over somewhere. 
And certainly in San Francisco, where we have 850,000 people, but we only had a couple of dozen infections per day last week. So it's a great moment. So we're grateful for this incredible performance by our team. We're grateful for the phenomenal quarter. It far exceeded our expectations. And I've just never seen a quarter like this. I mean, Gavin will go into the detail. Bret will go into these details. It was just incredible. It was beyond our expectation. It's the -- not just the best first quarter we've ever had, I think it's the best quarter we've ever had. We delivered $5.96 billion in revenue. It was up 23% year-over-year, just the customer velocity, the pipelines, the growth of the company, the ability for the teams to interact and have a huge impact. It was just awesome. 
We delivered $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and -- as a percentage of our revenue, it's just amazing what Salesforce can do today. Salesforce of a company, I said doing well and doing good. I mean here's the doing well part, $3.2 billion in cash flow on [ $596 ] billion in revenue, and that's up 74% year-over-year, reflecting the strong performance we've had since the impact of the pandemic began last year. 
Operating margin, again, and a huge call out here to Amy, and I'm going to talk more about Amy's amazing performance for the company and how she's rebuilt his incredible operating margin model. Operating model and how she's really kind of almost redesigning the company from the bottom up, it's awesome, which she's been doing. And you can see it here. Operating margin in the quarter was a healthy 20.2%. You look at the last 4 quarters, now starting Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 and now Q1, our margin, our revenue, our cash flow, it's awesome and to see these changes that I brought to the company is just inspire me. 
Now for the fiscal 2022, I'm thrilled, we are raising our revenue, our guide, by $250 million to $26 billion. This is really one of the most -- this is 1 of the largest raises we've really ever had. It represents 22% projected growth year-over-year. And we're not just raising revenue. And again, thanks to Amy, we're raising our operating margin to 18%. So that is incredible. And a few years, we're going to be doing $50 billion in -- by fiscal year '26. So that is an incredible thing. I mean, we're really seeing some momentum and some cadence as very powerful for the company. And the quarter once again demonstrates the strength and durability of our business, the quality of our leadership team. You're going to hear that today on the call. The relevance of our products, the incredible demand for digital transformation. But ultimately, it's been about customer success. And when I can talk about some of these customers and their amazing success with our products, companies that we know like Honeywell and 3M and Sonos. And I mean the Sonos' story is just awesome, where they just have this 4% growth when they went to consumer using our products, we're so grateful to them. But also, you're going to see it in the core products like I'm going to hit some of the key things, like how 8 out of the top 10 deals included Tableau, what a successful story, that acquisition has been a Mulesoft, an exact target. Now it's all worked out so well for us. This quarter is really just demonstrating that strength and durability of our business. 
And I'll tell you, we're the leader in the Sierra market. We all know that. We all know we're #1 CRM. You -- everyone's just saw the IDC again. Ranked Salesforce #1 by market share in CRM. Everyone knows the strategic nature of CRM. And this is the eighth year in the row that we're #1 in CRM, which is awesome. And last week, Salesforce also received one of the very highest radiants from Gartner as a vendor. We track that information. It's our customers talking to Gartner. We tracked it and saw this incredibly, what we call, strong overall vendor rating. That meant a lot to us. And I'll tell you if something else that means a lot to us. And this is kind of a moment. And I think we can say this, we -- we have to kind of get our head around this. We're about to pass SAP as the largest enterprise applications company in the world. And all the analysts have their models, they -- I know you all track SAP and Salesforce. We don't really talk so much about SAP, so say, mostly exited the CRM market so many years ago. But I'll tell you that it's awesome to see not just be #1 in CRM, but we're going to be the #1 enterprise software applications company in the world passing SAP. This is a moment. We can see it's imminent. 
And this pending acquisition is flat also. I mean, we've never been better positioned for the future. This is all digital, it's an all work-from-anywhere world. It's made our company, a Salesforce in Slack, well, it's it more important to customers than ever. So bringing them together is so exciting. And once this merger is approved, we're going to be able to build Slack and all of our products, they'll all become Slack first. It's going to make our customers more productive. We're going to work with software companies and building incredible new capabilities like we've seen these amazing examples of what Slack can do. 
I'll tell you. We're really excited about creating this #1 enterprise applications company. I can't wait for all of us to be back together and with you, and hopefully, we'll be together in person at our Investor Day coming up. 
So of course, the real highlight of every quarter is the success of our customers. Customer success is 1 of our highest values, trust, customer success, innovation, the ease of use of our products, quality, and we just had amazing traction during the quarter across all parts of our business. We hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions, and I hope that Gavin will talk about that. 
It was really this kind of first really, quarter of our company history, more than 120% growth year-over-year in these huge transactions. It really shows the whole world is going digital, and customers are connecting with their customers in a new way, and everyone needs CRM to do it. And they need analytics and they need integration, and we are the leaders in that area. And we're able to partner with them to deliver this incredible capability. On average, these 7-figure transactions, they included 4 or more of our clouds. That's awesome. It really goes to show the durability of the business built by so many amazing products, sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud, community cloud, commerce cloud, integration cloud, the analytics cloud with Tableau is awesome. 
And our successful integrations of and Tableau and MuleSoft continue to drive this incredible results for our customers and gives us so much confidence in this pending Slack acquisition. We're seeing more and more inclusion of Tableau and MuleSoft in our large deals as customers accelerate their digital transformations. I mean I'm sure it will stock everyone that Tableau, Tableau, was part of 8 of our top 10 deals. That really is evidence and the integration we've had with Customer 360 of its success. And MuleSoft was included in 5 of these top 10 deals, it was awesome. 
Honeywell is a great example, and I love Darius a diamond check, an incredible CEO, great example of a company investment in Salesforce across their business. Now they've been manufacturing innovative products for more than 100 years. Creating connected customer experience, breaking down silos for their 100,000 employees globally. But with sales cloud, Honeywell is enabling its global sales team to manage thousands of customers and sellers from anyone. And anyone who is with Brad and I in Washington, D.C. or got to watch it online. We went there to deal with our customers, employees in person, and we did this incredible world tour. And we have the Honeywell executives they're talking about this incredible transformation of their global sales team. And then it was really cool. 
And Tableau dashboards and Honeywell are providing their sales teams with these key insights to improve their productivity. And with my Trailhead, which is our reskilling platform, that's Honeywell reskilling their sales team right in their flow of work, increasing their performance. And service cloud, service cloud, together with field service and experience cloud is enabling Honeywell to seamlessly dispatch technicians for on-site product maintenance and proactive asset management and connected service partner experiences and customer experience for scheduling appointments and instantly troubleshooting problems. In fact, it was really that field service capability that helped us to amplify our relationship with Honeywell, and that's when Darius and I started to really collaborate and say, wow, we could bring this to the aviation business in Honeywell and transform. How they're doing their amazing jobs. 
I'll tell you, for a long time, we've had a trusted relationship with Dell Technologies and their incredible founder and tremendous brand of Salesforce and Michael Dell. Last year, Dell partnered Salesforce professional services, implemented the world's largest plant in the sales cloud to support its sales reps, go-to-market channel partners. 
I'll tell you, I just finished Michael Dell's new book, it's called Play Nice But Win. And it inspired me, and it really was exciting in that Salesforce and Dell have this partnership that help them win. It was powerful. And with service cloud, Dell is also giving a service agents a 360-degree deal of every customer. That was so awesome to see. And they're using marketing cloud, B2B customer journeys. They're transforming their seller experience. It's incredible. 
Another amazing CEO that we work with Mike Roman at 3M. And for those of you who watch Bret and I in Singapore, Bret might flue to Singapore for the kickoff of the quarter. And we are there in Singapore, and we're live with our customers and with our Ohana and employees and everybody and government leaders and well, we had the opportunity to talk to Mike Roman, the CEO of 3M, the iconic innovator, the center of efforts to come back COVID-19. And we were so happy to partner with them. And today, 3M is using Customer 360 across 83 countries. 
And when Mike realized there were counterfeit masks that weren't providing the protection of a 3M they partnered with us to make sure we can immediately deliver fraud or porting center with service cloud, and we did it. It was an awesome story. And we had to do it instantly, immediately. But there's been so many stories like that, especially in our governments, you see then what happened or what just is going on right now in Australia in Melbourne. They're, again, relying on Salesforce's contact tracing system to resolve this breakout. They're all locked down. I hope that they'll be able to identify everyone quickly and open back up quickly, and I know they've got the infrastructure to do it with salesforcework.com. It's an incredible story that's going on down there. 
3M getting back to them. Well, they're also piling tab well to create a single dashboard for their entire business. Tableau continues to be a strategic part of so many of our customers' business. And we're working with the pioneering online mortgage lender rocket mortgage to make complex transactions like buying a home or a car and evaluating personal loan. I mean, it's amazing what's going on with rocket mortgage. I'll tell you, I've really enjoyed working with that company, and they're inspiring because they themselves are just such us tremendous innovators. And if you know their CEO, Jay Farner, well, you'll understand how they're using our financial services cloud and marketing cloud to deliver a source of truth for all their customers' data and drive personalized engagement and scale. Jim is incredible. And during the quarter, it also selected MuleSoft to integrate across all their various systems. 
Of course, I mentioned Sonos before. It was an incredible story. They went digital. Direct to their consumer. Well, grew the business 84% year-over-year. And with marketing cloud, Sonos connected with their customers through e-mail, through mobile, through social channels, they built to Customer 360. They started pioneering a single source truth, and it continues to scale its business. They've even invested very deeply in e-commerce with Salesforce as well as Tableau, great, great story. And I'll tell you, those stories, and the story I just mentioned, like what's happening in Melbourne, well, that's all about our public sector business or the country of Japan with our vaccine cloud. There are so many places here in the United States like Plate County. I mean it's been an unbelievable year. It's been an unbelievable quarter. I mean, it really has been a lot about doing well and doing good. It's been about really showing how Salesforce is. The business -- the business could be the greatest platform for change. Now I'm telling you something that's really exciting and something new, and I couldn't be more excited to tell you this, and we're going to take another huge step forward here. 
Now I've been telling you that we've been doing a number of off-sites, bringing our executives together. We've opened our offices now. We have our employees back, and we're about to take another huge leap forward. We're taking a hugely forward because Dreamforce is coming back in-person in 2021, to San Francisco as well as simultaneously in New York, Paris, London, it's going to be a global Dreamforce. And we're going to have thousands of people at every venue. We're going to work closely with local officials, and we're going to do an amazing show. I hope all of you will be there, September 21st to 23rd. It's going to be the first Global Dreamforce.
And we're going to host group if Trailblazers in COVID-19 safe places, along with tens of millions online. It's going to be a hybrid event, physical and digital. Now we're going to follow these public health guidelines for every city, and I expect all of you to follow them as well. And in the U.S., we're going to require our attendees to be fully vaccinated to attempt. That's going to be a critical part, and it's how our core epidemiologists and medical teams at Salesforce have decided that we can do this amazing reopening, Dreamforce. 
We've worked with our long-time partner and customer Marriott. We've worked with leaders in this -- in our local medical communities and university, including Dr. Larry Brilliant. He's been a great friend of our company, a tremendous epidemiologists to follow these best practices and create this amazing new Dreamforce. So Dreamforce 2021 is going to be the most inclusive, the most accessible. Dreamforce Ever, it's going to bring the magic at Dreamforce to anyone, everywhere, anywhere. I mean, it's going to be great to be back together and be with all of you. It's going to be a family reunion, an incredible family union. 
And I'm also thrilled that earlier this month, we opened Salesforce Tower. As I mentioned, Amy and I were together in San Francisco. I was also open it in London. And then it's great to be back to work. And we want to do -- we want to be the pioneers in back to work. We know that people are going to still be working at home, but they're going to be in the office, too. And we're going to be doing these off sites and even some get togethers and collaborations, and we're even going to have this incredible new training facility, a cultural immersion facility, a place where we can be in large groups of our employees or even customers and their families together with Salesforce range, and we couldn't be more excited about that. And we see those 4 things together: in the office, at home, events, like off-sites and Dreamforce and even this incredible new training facility. I mean it's really inspired by general Electric. I went to Crossville, when I worked so closely with GE and their digital transformation, I was wondering, wow, we ever had something like this, I never saw the need. Why would Salesforce need a Crossville, but today we knew. Because so many of our employees are at home, how are we going to immerse them in our values. How are we going to educate them on our products? How are we going to show them what Salesforce is really all about? And that's why this incredible facility will be so important to us, and we're looking forward to talking about that. 
Over the last 22 years, we built an amazing culture, an amazing company. Seem to be the #1 enterprise applications company in the world, already the #1 CRM in the world. Now I'll tell you, when we started this business, we had 3 dreams. Create a new technology model. We call that the cloud, a new business model, subscription. We all understand that now. And a third model, a third model based on 111, 1% of our equity, 1% of our time or products, and that's become the business is the greatest platform for change. We couldn't be more excited. 
And I'll tell you 6 million employee volunteer hours. Well, that's evidence that this is working. $450 million in grants so far. 51,000 nonprofits running on our service for free, it's more evidence. I'm happy to give this testimony that our culture has enabled us to create an amazing company, but also to attract and retain amazing talent. And I'm enormously proud that Fortune just ranked us as one of the best places to work in the world. Again, I think this year, we're number two. But it's that 13th year that we've been on this list. It's really evidence that we can all do more in business. We can do well, and we can do good. 
And before I turn this over to Amy and I want to make sure you know about 2 amazing reimagine events that are also coming up this month. We're going to have Connections on June 2, our digital marketing event of the year. And on June 23, trail at DX, I hope you're going to be with us for both of those. I hope you'll be with us for Dreamforce. We're so grateful for your incredible partnership during this year, and we're delighted to deliver the best quarter we've ever delivered. 
And now a key part of that, Amy. Amy, go ahead."
122917,713767705,2303105,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to ac",929,"Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to achieve growth while also delivering profitability. 
So let me take you through some of the results for Q1 fiscal '22. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the first quarter was $5.96 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we discussed last quarter enabled us to deliver these results. While we had a favorable comparison for Q1, our 2-year new business CAGR also illustrates the continued strength in the business. 
A few areas to highlight. As Marc mentioned, we saw a record number of Q1 7-figure deals. Not only were these deals big, they were multi-cloud transformation, with on average more than 4 clouds included in Our vertical strategy continues to align our products to strategic industries. In particular, we saw strength in the public sector, which continues to accelerate as governments around the world turn to Salesforce Solutions. 
Surface Cloud demonstrated another quarter of incredible growth at scale, with Q1 revenue of $1.5 billion, growing 20% year-over-year, and Tableau continues to perform well. We are pleased with the progress of the integration. For example, in Q1, Tableau was in 8 of our top 10 deals for the company and in more than 60% of our 7-figure plus fields. 
Revenue attrition in Q1 was between 9% and 9.5%. We were -- we continue to be pleased with the progress made on attrition. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately $35 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $17.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. 
Turning to operating margins. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, largely driven by revenue outperformance and incremental expense efficiencies. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.21. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies, as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.23 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.24. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $3.2 billion, up 74% year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's cash flow seasonality was impacted by our decision to provide temporary financial flexibility to some of our customers during the pandemic. And we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher in Q1 and Q4. 
CapEx for the quarter was $171 million, leading to free cash flow of $3.1 billion, up 99% year-over-year. 
Before moving on to guidance, I want to update you on the status of the Slack transaction. We remain on track to close in Q2. Now as we refined our Q2 and full year guidance, we have also refined our expectation on the Slack closing date, which we now expect to be near the very end of the quarter. So I want to emphasize that all guidance assumptions involve changes involving Slack are completely timing driven. 
So turning to guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $6.22 billion to $6.23 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes no contribution from Slack. For Q2, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 20%. This guidance assumes approximately 
[Audio Gap]
GAAP loss per share of negative $0.10 to negative $0.09 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.92. 
[Audio Gap]
Now moving to fiscal '22 update. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by [ 200 ] or approximately 22% growth year-over-year. Now this guidance incorporates -- changes I mentioned in our close -- our guidance continues to include $190 million from Acumen. It has a $350 million raise on our core business. Our decision to raise -- 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18%, an expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year. This continues to include an expected 160 basis point headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investment in our core business and -- We are raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.22 to $0.24, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to $3.79 to $3.81. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.53

please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016 outlook. 
[Audio Gap]
guidance by 2 points, now expecting 12% to 13% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guidance is primarily driven by revenue performance and by the refined -- Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 8 points. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22 
[Audio Gap]
To close, our impressive start to fiscal '22 positions us well for the rest of the year. And keeps us on track to achieve our goal of $50 billion by fiscal '26. It really was a terrific quarter, and I'm grateful to our employees for their focus on both growth and efficiency during the quarter. 
Finally, it has been a pleasure to meet many of our shareholders over the past -- So I want to thank all of you for your continued support to Salesforce. 
And with that, Chantel, let's open up the call for questions."

So in the mid part of last year, when we were restructuring the business, we also put new investment back into the business, particularly with capacity, and we're seeing the benefit of that now as we come into the year really strong, ready to take advantage of the strong economies we're seeing around the world. So being able to invest when others work, I think, is a significant factor. 
And then the final thing is around execution. We had a really strong, I think, quarter because of the execution and the grip that we've got on the sales and service organization. We had a just launch this year. And that meant we got all the quotes deployed very, very quickly. We've got more selling days into the quarter. We've got a flatter organization now. So there's really clear accountability throughout the business. And we've seen that turn into great results. Great results, both in terms of the run rate business, but also particularly strong results in the big deals, and Marc talked about some of those numbers. So the business is really humming. The pipeline is super strong. It's across all clouds. It's across all geographies. It's a real strong focus on industries as well. The business is really, really pumping."

And I think the CEOs -- I mean I'll tell you from my own, obviously, we invested last year. We didn't pull back. We knew we had to go for it. And we had go all out. And it's counterintuitive. The world is ending, and you have to say, well, you got to go all out and realize that the world is not going to be ending in a year from now. And it's hard when you're in it because people start to panic. I think it's a normal human reaction. I mean we've been at Executive in Salesforce that came in and said; ""Oh, we've got a cut. We got to do this. We have to do that."" We reshaped. There's no question. We did some slight reshaping, but we didn't do any massive layoffs or anything like that of any consequence that I would say, ""Oh, we really try to cut,"" dramatically in some area or whatever, it was like we need to reshape to grow. We need to invest to grow. We need to do the things that we need to do as a company. And that's a year ago. So a year ago, it was a decision based on experience that is we have seen it, whether it was a recession of 2001 or the financial disasters of 2008, those are just moments. There are moments in time, but in the history of the company or if you look at the history of the equity from 2004 when we went public, you got to keep going. And at that moment is the time to go because, in many cases, your competitors are pulling back because they're afraid. And when your competitors are afraid, that's when you need to invest, and that's where you really need to grow. 
And I'll tell you, I think that, that's what Gavin did, that Gavin came in and he reshaped. He took out some took out some cost. He advanced certain areas. He rebalanced his oregon was able to provide greater market coverage and expanding his capacity, capability. And I think at levels I haven't seen in a long time.

Bret was at the tip of the spear on both of those, making sure that we're prepared for the future with the business plan and the reshaping plan that we needed and the technology plan and the technology vision. Then Amy came in and she said, no, we're going to rebuild the fundamental financial plan as well. And we're going to couple that financial plan from the bottom-up and build a new revenue plan and a new cash flow and margin plan, and you see that now. And then we had Gavin come in and say, this is how we're going to rebuild the distribution organization. And I think these 3 tiers, all coming together really are what you see today.

And also just to talk about so many of the things that are important to Salesforce because everyone knows, business is the greatest platform for change. We do believe that you can do well and do good at the same time. And before we go into these incredible results, we just want to let everybody know that our hearts and prayers are with all of our Ohana in India. They're on our mind every day, and we're so sorry for everything that they are going through. 
So I am now here with Amy and Bret and Gavin and Evan as well. And I'll just tell you that we're all vaccinated. We're grateful that we can be together. We're grateful that we are in a moment where we've been able to do that. We just finished a 2-day off-site with our top managers from around the world. We -- this is our third offsite we've done. We've done about 8 total management offsites and through the miracle of testing and now through the miracle of vaccinations and the ability to get back into business and be in person. We're just grateful for that. We definitely are missing each other, and it's been great to be able to run our business in person and to open our offices. Amy and I were in our offices on Monday and San Francisco together on our Ohana floor and it just was an emotional moment to know that we're back and that our Hana are back in the offices and that we're opening back up. This is just a critical time. So it's an amazing quarter, and it's just apposed against pandemic is not over everywhere, but it's starting to be over somewhere. 
And certainly in San Francisco, where we have 850,000 people, but we only had a couple of dozen infections per day last week. So it's a great moment. So we're grateful for this incredible performance by our team. We're grateful for the phenomenal quarter. It far exceeded our expectations. And I've just never seen a quarter like this. I mean, Gavin will go into the detail. Bret will go into these details. It was just incredible. It was beyond our expectation. It's the -- not just the best first quarter we've ever had, I think it's the best quarter we've ever had. We delivered $5.96 billion in revenue. It was up 23% year-over-year, just the customer velocity, the pipelines, the growth of the company, the ability for the teams to interact and have a huge impact. It was just awesome. 
We delivered $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and -- as a percentage of our revenue, it's just amazing what Salesforce can do today. Salesforce of a company, I said doing well and doing good. I mean here's the doing well part, $3.2 billion in cash flow on [ $596 ] billion in revenue, and that's up 74% year-over-year, reflecting the strong performance we've had since the impact of the pandemic began last year. 
Operating margin, again, and a huge call out here to Amy, and I'm going to talk more about Amy's amazing performance for the company and how she's rebuilt his incredible operating margin model. Operating model and how she's really kind of almost redesigning the company from the bottom up, it's awesome, which she's been doing. And you can see it here. Operating margin in the quarter was a healthy 20.2%. You look at the last 4 quarters, now starting Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 and now Q1, our margin, our revenue, our cash flow, it's awesome and to see these changes that I brought to the company is just inspire me. 
Now for the fiscal 2022, I'm thrilled, we are raising our revenue, our guide, by $250 million to $26 billion. This is really one of the most -- this is 1 of the largest raises we've really ever had. It represents 22% projected growth year-over-year. And we're not just raising revenue. And again, thanks to Amy, we're raising our operating margin to 18%. So that is incredible. And a few years, we're going to be doing $50 billion in -- by fiscal year '26. So that is an incredible thing. I mean, we're really seeing some momentum and some cadence as very powerful for the company. And the quarter once again demonstrates the strength and durability of our business, the quality of our leadership team. You're going to hear that today on the call. The relevance of our products, the incredible demand for digital transformation. But ultimately, it's been about customer success. And when I can talk about some of these customers and their amazing success with our products, companies that we know like Honeywell and 3M and Sonos. And I mean the Sonos' story is just awesome, where they just have this 4% growth when they went to consumer using our products, we're so grateful to them. But also, you're going to see it in the core products like I'm going to hit some of the key things, like how 8 out of the top 10 deals included Tableau, what a successful story, that acquisition has been a Mulesoft, an exact target. Now it's all worked out so well for us. This quarter is really just demonstrating that strength and durability of our business. 
And I'll tell you, we're the leader in the Sierra market. We all know that. We all know we're #1 CRM. You -- everyone's just saw the IDC again. Ranked Salesforce #1 by market share in CRM. Everyone knows the strategic nature of CRM. And this is the eighth year in the row that we're #1 in CRM, which is awesome. And last week, Salesforce also received one of the very highest radiants from Gartner as a vendor. We track that information. It's our customers talking to Gartner. We tracked it and saw this incredibly, what we call, strong overall vendor rating. That meant a lot to us. And I'll tell you if something else that means a lot to us. And this is kind of a moment. And I think we can say this, we -- we have to kind of get our head around this. We're about to pass SAP as the largest enterprise applications company in the world. And all the analysts have their models, they -- I know you all track SAP and Salesforce. We don't really talk so much about SAP, so say, mostly exited the CRM market so many years ago. But I'll tell you that it's awesome to see not just be #1 in CRM, but we're going to be the #1 enterprise software applications company in the world passing SAP. This is a moment. We can see it's imminent. 
And this pending acquisition is flat also. I mean, we've never been better positioned for the future. This is all digital, it's an all work-from-anywhere world. It's made our company, a Salesforce in Slack, well, it's it more important to customers than ever. So bringing them together is so exciting. And once this merger is approved, we're going to be able to build Slack and all of our products, they'll all become Slack first. It's going to make our customers more productive. We're going to work with software companies and building incredible new capabilities like we've seen these amazing examples of what Slack can do. 
I'll tell you. We're really excited about creating this #1 enterprise applications company. I can't wait for all of us to be back together and with you, and hopefully, we'll be together in person at our Investor Day coming up. 
So of course, the real highlight of every quarter is the success of our customers. Customer success is 1 of our highest values, trust, customer success, innovation, the ease of use of our products, quality, and we just had amazing traction during the quarter across all parts of our business. We hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions, and I hope that Gavin will talk about that. 
It was really this kind of first really, quarter of our company history, more than 120% growth year-over-year in these huge transactions. It really shows the whole world is going digital, and customers are connecting with their customers in a new way, and everyone needs CRM to do it. And they need analytics and they need integration, and we are the leaders in that area. And we're able to partner with them to deliver this incredible capability. On average, these 7-figure transactions, they included 4 or more of our clouds. That's awesome. It really goes to show the durability of the business built by so many amazing products, sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud, community cloud, commerce cloud, integration cloud, the analytics cloud with Tableau is awesome. 
And our successful integrations of and Tableau and MuleSoft continue to drive this incredible results for our customers and gives us so much confidence in this pending Slack acquisition. We're seeing more and more inclusion of Tableau and MuleSoft in our large deals as customers accelerate their digital transformations. I mean I'm sure it will stock everyone that Tableau, Tableau, was part of 8 of our top 10 deals. That really is evidence and the integration we've had with Customer 360 of its success. And MuleSoft was included in 5 of these top 10 deals, it was awesome. 
Honeywell is a great example, and I love Darius a diamond check, an incredible CEO, great example of a company investment in Salesforce across their business. Now they've been manufacturing innovative products for more than 100 years. Creating connected customer experience, breaking down silos for their 100,000 employees globally. But with sales cloud, Honeywell is enabling its global sales team to manage thousands of customers and sellers from anyone. And anyone who is with Brad and I in Washington, D.C. or got to watch it online. We went there to deal with our customers, employees in person, and we did this incredible world tour. And we have the Honeywell executives they're talking about this incredible transformation of their global sales team. And then it was really cool. 
And Tableau dashboards and Honeywell are providing their sales teams with these key insights to improve their productivity. And with my Trailhead, which is our reskilling platform, that's Honeywell reskilling their sales team right in their flow of work, increasing their performance. And service cloud, service cloud, together with field service and experience cloud is enabling Honeywell to seamlessly dispatch technicians for on-site product maintenance and proactive asset management and connected service partner experiences and customer experience for scheduling appointments and instantly troubleshooting problems. In fact, it was really that field service capability that helped us to amplify our relationship with Honeywell, and that's when Darius and I started to really collaborate and say, wow, we could bring this to the aviation business in Honeywell and transform. How they're doing their amazing jobs. 
I'll tell you, for a long time, we've had a trusted relationship with Dell Technologies and their incredible founder and tremendous brand of Salesforce and Michael Dell. Last year, Dell partnered Salesforce professional services, implemented the world's largest plant in the sales cloud to support its sales reps, go-to-market channel partners. 
I'll tell you, I just finished Michael Dell's new book, it's called Play Nice But Win. And it inspired me, and it really was exciting in that Salesforce and Dell have this partnership that help them win. It was powerful. And with service cloud, Dell is also giving a service agents a 360-degree deal of every customer. That was so awesome to see. And they're using marketing cloud, B2B customer journeys. They're transforming their seller experience. It's incredible. 
Another amazing CEO that we work with Mike Roman at 3M. And for those of you who watch Bret and I in Singapore, Bret might flue to Singapore for the kickoff of the quarter. And we are there in Singapore, and we're live with our customers and with our Ohana and employees and everybody and government leaders and well, we had the opportunity to talk to Mike Roman, the CEO of 3M, the iconic innovator, the center of efforts to come back COVID-19. And we were so happy to partner with them. And today, 3M is using Customer 360 across 83 countries. 
And when Mike realized there were counterfeit masks that weren't providing the protection of a 3M they partnered with us to make sure we can immediately deliver fraud or porting center with service cloud, and we did it. It was an awesome story. And we had to do it instantly, immediately. But there's been so many stories like that, especially in our governments, you see then what happened or what just is going on right now in Australia in Melbourne. They're, again, relying on Salesforce's contact tracing system to resolve this breakout. They're all locked down. I hope that they'll be able to identify everyone quickly and open back up quickly, and I know they've got the infrastructure to do it with salesforcework.com. It's an incredible story that's going on down there. 
3M getting back to them. Well, they're also piling tab well to create a single dashboard for their entire business. Tableau continues to be a strategic part of so many of our customers' business. And we're working with the pioneering online mortgage lender rocket mortgage to make complex transactions like buying a home or a car and evaluating personal loan. I mean, it's amazing what's going on with rocket mortgage. I'll tell you, I've really enjoyed working with that company, and they're inspiring because they themselves are just such us tremendous innovators. And if you know their CEO, Jay Farner, well, you'll understand how they're using our financial services cloud and marketing cloud to deliver a source of truth for all their customers' data and drive personalized engagement and scale. Jim is incredible. And during the quarter, it also selected MuleSoft to integrate across all their various systems. 
Of course, I mentioned Sonos before. It was an incredible story. They went digital. Direct to their consumer. Well, grew the business 84% year-over-year. And with marketing cloud, Sonos connected with their customers through e-mail, through mobile, through social channels, they built to Customer 360. They started pioneering a single source truth, and it continues to scale its business. They've even invested very deeply in e-commerce with Salesforce as well as Tableau, great, great story. And I'll tell you, those stories, and the story I just mentioned, like what's happening in Melbourne, well, that's all about our public sector business or the country of Japan with our vaccine cloud. There are so many places here in the United States like Plate County. I mean it's been an unbelievable year. It's been an unbelievable quarter. I mean, it really has been a lot about doing well and doing good. It's been about really showing how Salesforce is. The business -- the business could be the greatest platform for change. Now I'm telling you something that's really exciting and something new, and I couldn't be more excited to tell you this, and we're going to take another huge step forward here. 
Now I've been telling you that we've been doing a number of off-sites, bringing our executives together. We've opened our offices now. We have our employees back, and we're about to take another huge leap forward. We're taking a hugely forward because Dreamforce is coming back in-person in 2021, to San Francisco as well as simultaneously in New York, Paris, London, it's going to be a global Dreamforce. And we're going to have thousands of people at every venue. We're going to work closely with local officials, and we're going to do an amazing show. I hope all of you will be there, September 21st to 23rd. It's going to be the first Global Dreamforce.
And we're going to host group if Trailblazers in COVID-19 safe places, along with tens of millions online. It's going to be a hybrid event, physical and digital. Now we're going to follow these public health guidelines for every city, and I expect all of you to follow them as well. And in the U.S., we're going to require our attendees to be fully vaccinated to attempt. That's going to be a critical part, and it's how our core epidemiologists and medical teams at Salesforce have decided that we can do this amazing reopening, Dreamforce. 
We've worked with our long-time partner and customer Marriott. We've worked with leaders in this -- in our local medical communities and university, including Dr. Larry Brilliant. He's been a great friend of our company, a tremendous epidemiologists to follow these best practices and create this amazing new Dreamforce. So Dreamforce 2021 is going to be the most inclusive, the most accessible. Dreamforce Ever, it's going to bring the magic at Dreamforce to anyone, everywhere, anywhere. I mean, it's going to be great to be back together and be with all of you. It's going to be a family reunion, an incredible family union. 
And I'm also thrilled that earlier this month, we opened Salesforce Tower. As I mentioned, Amy and I were together in San Francisco. I was also open it in London. And then it's great to be back to work. And we want to do -- we want to be the pioneers in back to work. We know that people are going to still be working at home, but they're going to be in the office, too. And we're going to be doing these off sites and even some get togethers and collaborations, and we're even going to have this incredible new training facility, a cultural immersion facility, a place where we can be in large groups of our employees or even customers and their families together with Salesforce range, and we couldn't be more excited about that. And we see those 4 things together: in the office, at home, events, like off-sites and Dreamforce and even this incredible new training facility. I mean it's really inspired by general Electric. I went to Crossville, when I worked so closely with GE and their digital transformation, I was wondering, wow, we ever had something like this, I never saw the need. Why would Salesforce need a Crossville, but today we knew. Because so many of our employees are at home, how are we going to immerse them in our values. How are we going to educate them on our products? How are we going to show them what Salesforce is really all about? And that's why this incredible facility will be so important to us, and we're looking forward to talking about that. 
Over the last 22 years, we built an amazing culture, an amazing company. Seem to be the #1 enterprise applications company in the world, already the #1 CRM in the world. Now I'll tell you, when we started this business, we had 3 dreams. Create a new technology model. We call that the cloud, a new business model, subscription. We all understand that now. And a third model, a third model based on 111, 1% of our equity, 1% of our time or products, and that's become the business is the greatest platform for change. We couldn't be more excited. 
And I'll tell you 6 million employee volunteer hours. Well, that's evidence that this is working. $450 million in grants so far. 51,000 nonprofits running on our service for free, it's more evidence. I'm happy to give this testimony that our culture has enabled us to create an amazing company, but also to attract and retain amazing talent. And I'm enormously proud that Fortune just ranked us as one of the best places to work in the world. Again, I think this year, we're number two. But it's that 13th year that we've been on this list. It's really evidence that we can all do more in business. We can do well, and we can do good. 
And before I turn this over to Amy and I want to make sure you know about 2 amazing reimagine events that are also coming up this month. We're going to have Connections on June 2, our digital marketing event of the year. And on June 23, trail at DX, I hope you're going to be with us for both of those. I hope you'll be with us for Dreamforce. We're so grateful for your incredible partnership during this year, and we're delighted to deliver the best quarter we've ever delivered. 
And now a key part of that, Amy. Amy, go ahead."
122917,713767705,2303154,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to ac",1069,"Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to achieve growth while also delivering profitability. 
So let me take you through some of the results for Q1 fiscal '22. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the first quarter was $5.96 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we discussed last quarter enabled us to deliver these results. While we had a favorable comparison for Q1, our 2-year new business CAGR also illustrates the continued strength in the business. 
A few areas to highlight. As Marc mentioned, we saw a record number of Q1 7-figure deals. Not only were these deals big, they were multi-cloud transformation, with on average more than 4 clouds included in Our vertical strategy continues to align our products to strategic industries. In particular, we saw strength in the public sector, which continues to accelerate as governments around the world turn to Salesforce Solutions. 
Surface Cloud demonstrated another quarter of incredible growth at scale, with Q1 revenue of $1.5 billion, growing 20% year-over-year, and Tableau continues to perform well. We are pleased with the progress of the integration. For example, in Q1, Tableau was in 8 of our top 10 deals for the company and in more than 60% of our 7-figure plus fields. 
Revenue attrition in Q1 was between 9% and 9.5%. We were -- we continue to be pleased with the progress made on attrition. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately $35 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $17.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. 
Turning to operating margins. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, largely driven by revenue outperformance and incremental expense efficiencies. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.21. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies, as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.23 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.24. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $3.2 billion, up 74% year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's cash flow seasonality was impacted by our decision to provide temporary financial flexibility to some of our customers during the pandemic. And we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher in Q1 and Q4. 
CapEx for the quarter was $171 million, leading to free cash flow of $3.1 billion, up 99% year-over-year. 
Before moving on to guidance, I want to update you on the status of the Slack transaction. We remain on track to close in Q2. Now as we refined our Q2 and full year guidance, we have also refined our expectation on the Slack closing date, which we now expect to be near the very end of the quarter. So I want to emphasize that all guidance assumptions involve changes involving Slack are completely timing driven. 
So turning to guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $6.22 billion to $6.23 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes no contribution from Slack. For Q2, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 20%. This guidance assumes approximately 3 points of growth from Slack. 
As a reminder, Q2 fiscal '21 benefited from strong renewals performance. We expect Q2 GAAP loss per share of negative $0.10 to negative $0.09 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.92. Our assumptions include a $0.09 impact from Slack, primarily driven by OIE and transaction and integration costs. 
Now moving to fiscal '22 updates. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $2.50 million to $25.9 billion to $26 billion or approximately 22% growth year-over-year. Now this guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $500 million from Slack due to the changes I mentioned in our closed timing assumptions. Our guidance continues to include $190 million from Acumen. Net of the revised Slack contribution, this represents a $350 million raise on our core business. Our decision to raise fiscal '22 revenue is reflective of our Q1 performance and our confidence in our ability to execute for the rest of the year. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18%, an expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year. This continues to include an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investment in our core business and the moderate increase of travel in the second half of this year. We are raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.22 to $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to $3.79 to $3.81. 
We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASCO 2016 outlook. 
We are also raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points, now expecting 12% to 13% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and by the refined timing expectations on M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 8 points. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 12% to 13% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%. 
To close, our impressive start to fiscal '22 positions us well for the rest of the year and keeps us on track to achieve our goal of $50 billion by fiscal '26. It really was a terrific quarter, and I'm grateful to our employees for their focus on both growth and efficiency during the quarter. 
Finally, it has been a pleasure to meet many of our shareholders over the past few months. And I want to thank all of you for your continued support of Salesforce. 
And with that, Chantel, let's open up the call for questions."

And we also believe that we also have to include all stakeholders, not just our company, but our customers and our partners and even consumers. And I think that Bret has created an incredible vision for the future work and an incredible platform. And when you think about as well, what Slack is going to do in terms of transforming our company, when each one of our clouds become Slack first well.

And more importantly, it's a question on the mind of every CEO, in every single one of our customers. When you look at the trends of this past year, like that wonderful Honeywell story that Marc mentioned in his script, they shifted 7,000 salespeople from in-person to virtual customer meetings. Customer meetings aren't going back to conference rooms only. They're going to stay on Zoom as companies like ours just realize that we can execute as well as ever before in this digital environment. The contact centers that move from being buildings to be in the cloud, take the power of service cloud, they're not going back to buildings anymore. When you think about to move from doctors' offices to telemedicine, you look across our portfolio, the move to digital commerce and digital marketing and an incredible cyber week numbers we talked about last quarter. We really think that this digital Customer 360, this platform we've been building is an absolutely crucial part of the future of work for every single one of our customers, in particular, because things are not going to snap back to the way they were. 
It's also, as Marc mentioned, I think one of the reasons we're so excited about the prospect of closing this Slack transaction. When you think about what does it mean to succeed and the all digital work anywhere world, it's Customer 360, which enables you to digitize your entire customer experience and get back to growth in this incredible economy. And it's the digital HQ from Slack, which enables you to connect to all of your employees, all of your partners and all of your customers together in this incredible new engagement platform. And we think the 2 together represent an incredible opportunity that I think is truly the operating system for growth for every company embracing this new way of working and getting back to growth in its new normal."

I think one of the things, if you see the numbers, the strength is really across the portfolio. When we talk about the fact that of those 7-figure deals, they, on average, included more than 4 of our clouds. We're not selling individual products. We're selling a Customer 360 solution to really transform the entire customer experience. That said -- last quarter, I talked a lot about the amazing growth in marketing and e-commerce due to cyber week. It's really heartening to see just all aspects of the economy and our portfolio growing. One of the most fun for me, this quarter in Sales cloud, we're seeing over 5 million opportunities created every day. That is almost a 20% increase over last quarter. This is every B2B selling team in the world, investing in growth again, recognizing the demand environment we see in the economy at every single part of our customer base.
Another great example of this is that -- and I don't even know if you know this, Marc, but in April, Einstein started doing over 100 billion predictions per day. And it's a great example of these platform investments that we did multiple years ago that our customers that the whole economy goes digital is really -- are really benefiting from. When you think about what does that mean? It means that every e-mail you get is more personalized. It means that every e-commerce you page is suited to your interest and your needs, driving growth and success for our customers, but really represents I think the importance of these foundational technology investments. And another great example of this. Marc talked about Customer 360, Analytics and Tableau,  integration with MuleSoft. You're really seeing the importance of, I'll call it, that technology foundation as it relates to the Customer 360 multi-cloud deployment. MuleSoft is now doing a $4.86 billion integration transactions every day. That is up 28% quarter-over-quarter. 
And it's sort of the boring but important part of this Customer 360, integrating all of those legacy systems, so our customers can move faster in the face of an economy that's, I think, shifting more rapidly than ever before. And really, I think, shows the importance of our acquisitions as it relates to our overall value proposition of Customer 360."

It looks like there's a ton of momentum at Salesforce right now. Maybe one question for Marc and one for Amy. For Marc, there's been some investor debate on sort of to what degree digital transformations are really accelerating. A lot of other companies had more mixed or difficult Q1. Do you guys seem to have really hit it out of the park this Q1. Can you tell us kind of your view on sort of how your customers are changing their investment profiles? And when is that going to hit? Is that something that is really a 2021 event? Or because of the big strategic nature of these deals, this could take some time to flush out? I guess I'm asking how is the pipeline looking for these big strategic deals? 
And then the question for Amy. We were impressed when you sort of stuck it with 17.5% operating margins with the initial FY '22 guide, now you're raising it another 50 basis points. Can you talk to us about, does that come from sort of expenses being pushed out? Or is it just kind of -- is there actual kind of more efficiencies that you're finding in the business that enable you to raise the operating margin guide here?"

The cash flow, [ 3 2 3 ] But then when I really get down into this operating margin at 20.2%, but also the ability to raise for the year. It really gets down to this new model that she's really pioneered and is installed in the company and it's given us a fresh look at how we run our business and what we're going to do in the future, how we think about the right balance between revenue and cash flow and margin. 
And the pandemic gave all of us the ability to reset our lives, but also our businesses. And when we look at resetting our businesses, we also have to reset our financial models. And I think that this is the result of now 4 amazing quarters of this financial model emerging. And I think we're going to see that continue to pay out for the rest of the year and future years as well that we will benefit from this. And I don't think it's something that's getting pulled forward or pushed back or this or that, it's all zero-based from the bottom. So that's what's exciting, and it's a commitment that we have to a new model and a new approach. And also this idea, though, it's a new way to work. 
Now in regards to the customer focus, I think, while we just have never seen customer demand like this. And we don't -- there's certain applications that we've been asked not to profile on the call, for example, in regards to some things that the U.S. government has done in terms of making sure that stimulus gets to the right place at the right time. And we were asked to do things in a matter of weeks. It's not just limited to our government. It's other governments. It's other businesses. I mean, I've never seen, and I've said this in the last couple of calls, so many, what I would call, emergency deployments. Usually, they say, ""Hey, we like to have this in 6 months, 12 months, the most 18 months. That's one of the reasons they come to Salesforce. 
Very fast time to value. This is critical. But for us, they want instant time of value like, wait, we have to build this in the book. We don't go -- we got to go. All right, we'll build. We'll build it. We'll deliver this. We'll make this happen for you. And I've been so fortunate to have Gavin really by my side during all of this. I mean everybody knows Gavin's tremendous lineage. And Gavin worked and I worked together have been friends for more than a decade. But of course, at the COBC, I was always admired his business process and business practice and his ability to bring discipline. But now watching him run our customer organization. And what he's done now over the last year, that's just been shocked to me. But Gavin, I think you should just kind of come in here because it's not just Amy, who's reimagined the financial model. You reimagine the entire customer model and how we're going to market and the balance of sales and service, and you've reimagined the level of management that we have and where we're putting that management level of capacity, the relevance, the participation, I mean the enablement, these things that you've laid in. So would you just tell us, give us what's happening on the customer side? And how do you see the market today?"

What we offer at the moment is what",367,"Well, thanks, Marc. It's -- as you say, it's been an absolutely stellar quarter, an incredible quarter. And 3 words come to mind for me, relevance, investment and execution. Relevance is, I think, really, really clear. What we offer at the moment is what organizations around the world, be those companies or governments. It's what they're looking for to manage their business, and we see that in the new business pipeline. It's extraordinarily strong. Yes, we have a favorable compare. But if you look at the 2-year performance, it's really, really strong, and that's the key number to look at. We're not persuaded by just the year-on-year. It needs to be the 2-year performance with an easy compare. So I think taking advantage of the economy, the strength of investment going into the economy in many places around the world. We're perfectly placed to take advantage of that. 
I think the second thing is about investment. So in the mid part of last year, when we were restructuring the business, we also put new investment back into the business, particularly with capacity, and we're seeing the benefit of that now as we come into the year really strong, ready to take advantage of the strong economies we're seeing around the world. So being able to invest when others work, I think, is a significant factor. 
And then the final thing is around execution. We had a really strong, I think, quarter because of the execution and the grip that we've got on the sales and service organization. We had a just launch this year. And that meant we got all the quotes deployed very, very quickly. We've got more selling days into the quarter. We've got a flatter organization now. So there's really clear accountability throughout the business. And we've seen that turn into great results. Great results, both in terms of the run rate business, but also particularly strong results in the big deals, and Marc talked about some of those numbers. So the business is really humming. The pipeline is super strong. It's across all clouds. It's across all geographies. It's a real strong focus on industries as well. The business is really, really pumping."

And I think the CEOs -- I mean I'll tell you from my own, obviously, we invested last year. We didn't pull back. We knew we had to go for it. And we had go all out. And it's counterintuitive. The world is ending, and you have to say, well, you got to go all out and realize that the world is not going to be ending in a year from now. And it's hard when you're in it because people start to panic. I think it's a normal human reaction. I mean we've been at Executive in Salesforce that came in and said; ""Oh, we've got a cut. We got to do this. We have to do that."" We reshaped. There's no question. We did some slight reshaping, but we didn't do any massive layoffs or anything like that of any consequence that I would say, ""Oh, we really try to cut,"" dramatically in some area or whatever, it was like we need to reshape to grow. We need to invest to grow. We need to do the things that we need to do as a company. And that's a year ago. So a year ago, it was a decision based on experience that is we have seen it, whether it was a recession of 2001 or the financial disasters of 2008, those are just moments. There are moments in time, but in the history of the company or if you look at the history of the equity from 2004 when we went public, you got to keep going. And at that moment is the time to go because, in many cases, your competitors are pulling back because they're afraid. And when your competitors are afraid, that's when you need to invest, and that's where you really need to grow. 
And I'll tell you, I think that, that's what Gavin did, that Gavin came in and he reshaped. He took out some took out some cost. He advanced certain areas. He rebalanced his oregon was able to provide greater market coverage and expanding his capacity, capability. And I think at levels I haven't seen in a long time.

Bret was at the tip of the spear on both of those, making sure that we're prepared for the future with the business plan and the reshaping plan that we needed and the technology plan and the technology vision. Then Amy came in and she said, no, we're going to rebuild the fundamental financial plan as well. And we're going to couple that financial plan from the bottom-up and build a new revenue plan and a new cash flow and margin plan, and you see that now.

So I am now here with Amy and Bret and Gavin and Evan as well, and I'll just tell you that we're all vaccinated. We're grateful that we can be together. We're grateful that we are in a moment where we've been able to do that. We just finished a 2-day off-site with our top managers from around the world. We -- this is our third off-site we've done. We've done about 8 total management off-sites and through the miracle of testing and now through the miracle of vaccinations and the ability to get back into business and be in person, we're just grateful for that. We definitely are missing each other, and it's been great to be able to run our business in person and to open our offices.
Amy and I were in our offices on Monday in San Francisco, together on our Ohana floor and it just was an emotional moment to know that we're back and that our Ohana are back in the offices and that we're opening back up. This is just a critical time. So it's an amazing quarter, and it's juxtaposed against -- the pandemic is not over everywhere, but it's starting to be over somewhere and certainly in San Francisco, where we have 850,000 people, but we only had a couple dozen infections per day last week. So it's a great moment.
So we're grateful. We're grateful for this incredible performance by our team. We're grateful for the phenomenal quarter. It far exceeded our expectations. And I've just never seen a quarter like this. I mean Gavin will go into the details. Bret will go into the details. It was just incredible. It was beyond our expectation. It's the -- not just the best first quarter we've ever had. I think it's the best quarter we've ever had. We delivered $5.96 billion in revenue. It was up 23% year-over-year. Just the customer velocity, the pipelines, the growth of the company, the ability for the teams to interact and have a huge impact, it was just awesome.
We delivered $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, and as a percentage of our revenue, it's just amazing what Salesforce can do today. Salesforce as a company, I said doing well and doing good. I mean here's the doing well part, $3.2 billion in cash flow on $5.96 billion in revenue, and that's up 74% year-over-year, reflecting the strong performance we've had since the impact of the pandemic began last year.
Operating margin, again -- and a huge call out here to Amy, and I'm going to talk more about Amy's amazing performance for the company and how she's rebuilt this incredible operating margin model and operating model and how she's really kind of almost redesigning the company from the bottom up. It's awesome, what she's been doing. And you can see it here. Operating margin in the quarter was a healthy 20.2%. You look at the last 4 quarters, now starting Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 and now Q1, our margin, our revenue, our cash flow, it's awesome, and to see these changes that Amy has brought to the company has just inspired me.
Now for the fiscal 2022, I'm thrilled we are raising our revenue, our guide by $250 million to $26 billion. This is really one of the most -- this is 1 of the largest raises we've really ever had. It represents 22% projected growth year-over-year. And we're not just raising revenue. And again, thanks to Amy. We're raising our operating margin to 18%. So that is incredible.
And in a few years, we're going to be doing $50 billion in -- by fiscal year '26. So that is an incredible thing. I mean we're really seeing some momentum and some cadence that's very powerful for the company. And the quarter once again demonstrates the strength and durability of our business, the quality of our leadership team. You're going to hear that today on the call, the relevance of our products, the incredible demand for digital transformation. But ultimately, it's been about customer success.
And when I can talk about some of these customers and their amazing success with our products, companies that we know like Honeywell and 3M and Sonos. And I mean the Sonos story is just awesome, where they've just had this 84% growth when they went to consumer using our products. We're so grateful to them. But also, you're going to see it in the core products like I'm going to hit some of the key things, like how 8 of the top 10 deals included Tableau, what a successful story that acquisition has been and MuleSoft and ExactTarget. Now it's all worked out so well for us. This quarter is really just demonstrating that strength and durability of our business.
And I'll tell you, we're the leader in the CRM market. We all know that. We all know we're #1 CRM. You -- everyone's just saw the IDC again, ranked Salesforce #1 by market share in CRM. Everyone knows the strategic nature of CRM. And this is the eighth year in a row that we're #1 in CRM, which is awesome.
And last week, Salesforce also received one of the very highest ratings from Gartner as a vendor. We track that information. It's our customers talking to Gartner. We tracked it and saw this incredibly, what we call, strong overall vendor rating. That meant a lot to us.
And I'll tell you of something else that means a lot to us, and this is kind of a moment. And I think we can say this. We -- it's -- we have to kind of get our head around this. We're about to pass SAP as the largest enterprise applications company in the world. And all the analysts have their models. They -- I know you all track SAP and Salesforce. We don't really talk so much about SAP since they mostly exited the CRM market so many years ago. But I'll tell you that it's awesome to see not just be #1 in CRM, but, yes, we're going to be the #1 enterprise software applications company in the world passing SAP. That -- this is a moment. We can see it's imminent.
And this pending acquisition of Slack also, I mean, we've never been better positioned for the future. This is a all digital. It's an all work-from-anywhere world. It's made our company, Salesforce and Slack, well, more important to customers than ever. So bringing them together is so exciting. And once this merger is approved, we're going to be able to build Slack and all of our products, they'll all become Slack first. It's going to make our customers more productive. We're going to work with software companies in building incredible new capabilities like we've seen these amazing examples of what Slack can do.
I'll tell you, we're really excited about creating this #1 enterprise applications company, and I can't wait for all of us to be back together and with you. And hopefully, we'll be together in person at our Investor Day coming up. 
So of course, the real highlight of every quarter is the success of our customers. Customer success is one of our highest values, trust, customer success, innovation, the ease of use of our products, quality, and we just had amazing traction during the quarter across all parts of our business. We hit an all-time high in 7-figure plus transactions, and I hope that Gavin will talk about that.
It was really this kind of first really, quarter of our company history, more than 120% growth year-over-year in these huge transactions. It really shows the whole world is going digital, and customers are connecting with their customers in a new way, and everyone needs CRM to do it. And they need analytics, and they need integration. And we are the leaders in that area. And we're able to partner with them to deliver this incredible capability.
On average, these 7-figure transactions, they included 4 or more of our clouds. That's awesome. It really goes to show the durability of the business built by so many amazing products, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Integration Cloud, the Analytics Cloud with Tableau is awesome. And our successful integrations of ExactTarget and Tableau and MuleSoft continue to drive these incredible results for our customers and gives us so much confidence in this pending Slack acquisition.
We're seeing more and more inclusion of Tableau and MuleSoft in our large deals as customers accelerate their digital transformations. I mean I'm sure it will shock everyone that Tableau, Tableau, was part of 8 of our top 10 deals. That really is evidence and the integration we've had with Customer 360 of its success. And MuleSoft was included in 5 of these top 10 deals. It was awesome.
Honeywell is a great example, and I love Darius Adamczyk, incredible CEO, great example of a company investment in Salesforce across their business. Now they've been manufacturing innovative products for more than 100 years, creating connected customer experience, breaking down silos for their 100,000 employees globally. But with Sales Cloud, Honeywell is enabling its global sales team to manage thousands of customers and sellers from anywhere. And anyone who was with Bret and I in Washington, D.C. or got to watch it online, we went there to deal with our customers, employees in person, and we did this incredible world tour. And we have the Honeywell executives. They're talking about this incredible transformation of their global sales team. And then it was really cool. And Tableau dashboards and Honeywell are providing their sales teams with these key insights to improve their productivity.
And with My Trailhead, which is our reskilling platform, that's Honeywell reskilling their sales team right in their flow of work, increasing their performance. And Service Cloud, Service Cloud, together with Field Service and Experience Cloud is enabling Honeywell to seamlessly dispatch technicians for on-site product maintenance and proactive asset management and connected service partner experiences and customer experience for scheduling appointments and instantly troubleshooting problems. In fact, it was really that field service capability that helped us to amplify our relationship with Honeywell, and that's when Darius and I started to really collaborate and say, wow, we could bring this to the aviation business in Honeywell to transform how they're doing their amazing jobs.
I'll tell you, for a long time, we've had a trusted relationship with Dell Technologies and their incredible founder and tremendous brand of Salesforce and Michael Dell. Last year, Dell partnered with Salesforce Professional Services, implemented the world's largest deployment of Sales Cloud to support its sales reps, go-to-market channel partners.
I'll tell you, I just finished Michael Dell's new book. It's called Play Nice But Win. And it inspired me, and it really was exciting in that Salesforce and Dell have this partnership that helped them win. It was powerful. And with Service Cloud, Dell is also giving its service agents a 360-degree view of every customer. That was so awesome to see. And they're using Marketing Cloud for B2B customer journeys. They're transforming their seller experience. It's incredible.
Another amazing CEO that we work with, Mike Roman at 3M. And for those of you who watched Bret and I in Singapore, Bret and I flew to Singapore for the kickoff of the quarter. And we are there in Singapore, and we were live with our customers and with our Ohana and employees and everybody and government leaders, and well, we had the opportunity to talk to Mike Roman, the CEO of 3M, the iconic innovator, the center of efforts to combat COVID-19. And we were so happy to partner with them. And today, 3M is using Customer 360 across 83 countries.
And when Mike realized there were counterfeit masks that weren't providing the protection of a 3M mask, they partnered with us to make sure we can immediately deliver fraud reporting center with Service Cloud, and we did it. It was an awesome story. And we had to do it instantly, immediately.
There's been so many stories like that, especially in our governments. You see then what happened or what just is going on right now in Australia in Melbourne. They're, again, relying on Salesforce's contact tracing system to resolve this breakout. They're all locked down. I hope that they'll be able to identify everyone quickly and open back up quickly. And I know they've got the infrastructure to do it with Salesforce Work.com. It's an incredible story that's going on down there.
3M, getting back to them. Well, they're also piling Tableau to create a single dashboard for their entire business.
Tableau continues to be a strategic part of so many of our customers' business. And we're working with the pioneering online mortgage lender, Rocket Mortgage, to make complex transactions like buying a home or a car and evaluating personal loan. I mean it's amazing what's going on with Rocket Mortgage. I'll tell you, I've really enjoyed working with that company, and they're inspiring because they themselves are just such tremendous innovators. And if you know their CEO, Jay Farner, well, you'll understand how they're using our Financial Services Cloud and Marketing Cloud to deliver a source of truth for all their customers' data and drive personalized engagement and scale. Jim is incredible. And during the quarter, they also selected MuleSoft to integrate across all their various systems.
Of course, I mentioned Sonos before. It was an incredible story. They went digital, direct to their consumer, well, grew their business 84% year-over-year. And with Marketing Cloud, Sonos connected with their customers through e-mail, through mobile, through social channels. They built to Customer 360. They started pioneering a single source of truth. And it continues to scale its business. They've even invested very deeply in e-commerce with Salesforce as well as Tableau, great story.
And I'll tell you, those stories and the story I just mentioned, like what's happening in Melbourne, well, that's all about our public sector business or the country of Japan with our Vaccine Cloud. There are so many places here in the United States like Lake County. I mean it's been an unbelievable year. It's been an unbelievable quarter. I mean it really has been a lot about doing well and doing good. It's been about really showing how Salesforce is. The business could be the greatest platform for change. Now I'm telling you something that's really exciting and something new, and I couldn't be more excited to tell you this. And we're going to take another huge step forward here.
Now I've been telling you that we've been doing a number of off-sites, bringing our executives together. We've opened our offices now. We have our employees back, and we're about to take another huge leap forward. We're taking a hugely forward because Dreamforce is coming back in person in 2021 to San Francisco as well as simultaneously in New York, Paris, London. It's going to be a global Dreamforce. And we're going to have thousands of people at every venue. We're going to work closely with local officials, and we're going to do an amazing show. I hope all of you will be there, September 21st to 23rd. It's going to be the first global Dreamforce.
And we're going to host groups of Trailblazers in COVID-19 safe places, along with tens of millions online. It's going to be a hybrid event, physical and digital. Now we're going to follow these public health guidelines for every city, and I expect all of you to follow them as well. And in the U.S., we're going to require our attendees to be fully vaccinated to attend. That's going to be a critical part, and it's how our core epidemiologists and medical teams at Salesforce have decided that we can do this amazing reopening, Dreamforce.
We've worked with our long-time partner and customer, Marriott. We've worked with leaders in this -- in our local medical communities and university, including Dr. Larry Brilliant. He's been a great friend of our company, a tremendous epidemiologist, to follow these best practices and create this amazing new Dreamforce. So Dreamforce 2021 is going to be the most inclusive, the most accessible. Dreamforce ever. It's going to bring the magic of Dreamforce to anyone, everywhere, anywhere. I mean it's going to be great to be back together and be with all of you. It's going to be a family reunion, an incredible family reunion.
And I'm also thrilled that, earlier this month, we opened Salesforce Tower. As I mentioned, Amy and I were together in San Francisco. It was also -- we've opened it in London. And then it's great to be back to work. And we want to do -- we want to be the pioneers in back to work. We know that people are going to still be working at home, but they're going to be in the office, too. And we're going to be doing these off-sites and events and get togethers and collaborations, and we're even going to have this incredible new training facility, a cultural immersion facility, a place where we can bring large groups of our employees or even customers and their families together with Salesforce ranch, and we couldn't be more excited about that.
And we see those 4 things together: in the office, at home, events like off-sites and Dreamforce, and even this incredible new training facility. I mean it's really inspired by General Electric. I went to Crotonville, when I worked so closely with GE and their digital transformation. I was wondering, wow, we never had something like this. I never saw the need. Why would Salesforce need a Crotonville, but today we knew. Because so many of our employees are at home, how are we going to immerse them in our values? How are we going to educate them on our products? How are we going to show them what Salesforce is really all about? And that's why this incredible facility will be so important to us, and we're looking forward to talking about that.
Over the last 22 years, we built an amazing culture, an amazing company. Soon to be the #1 enterprise applications company in the world, already the #1 CRM in the world. Now I'll tell you, when we started this business, we had 3 dreams: to create a new technology model, we call that the cloud; a new business model, subscription, we all understand that now; and a third model, a third model based on 1-1-1, 1% of our equity, 1% of our time, our products, and that's become the business is the greatest platform for change. We couldn't be more excited.
And I'll tell you 6 million employee volunteer hours, well, that's evidence that this is working; $450 million in grants so far. 51,000 nonprofits running on our service for free, it's more evidence. I'm happy to give this testimony that our culture has enabled us to create an amazing company but also to attract and retain amazing talent. And I'm enormously proud that Fortune just ranked us as one of the best places to work in the world. Again, I think this year, we're #2. But it's that 13th year that we've been on this list. It's really evidence that we can all do more in business. We can do well, and we can do good.
And before I turn this over to Amy and I want to make sure you know about 2 amazing reimagine events that are also coming up this month. We're going to have Connections on June 2, our digital marketing event of the year; and on June 23, TrailheaDX. I hope you're going to be with us for both of those. I hope you'll be with us for Dreamforce. We're so grateful for your incredible partnership during this year, and we're delighted to deliver the best quarter we've ever delivered.
And now a key part of that, Amy. Amy, go ahead."
122917,713767705,2303296,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to ac",1070,"Thank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. Performance in Q1 was impressive across all financial metrics. We saw record levels of Q1 new business performance and strength across all products, regions and customer sizes. Importantly, we were able to achieve growth while also delivering profitability.
So let me take you through some of the results for Q1 fiscal '22. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the first quarter was $5.96 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we discussed last quarter enabled us to deliver these results. While we had a favorable comparison for Q1, our 2-year new business CAGR also illustrates the continued strength in the business.
A few areas to highlight. As Marc mentioned, we saw a record number of Q1 7-figure deals. Not only were these deals big, they were multi-cloud transformation with, on average, more than 4 clouds included in each. Our vertical strategy continues to align our products to strategic industries. In particular, we saw strength in the public sector, which continues to accelerate as governments around the world turn to Salesforce Solutions.
Service Cloud demonstrated another quarter of incredible growth at scale with Q1 revenue of $1.5 billion, growing 20% year-over-year, and Tableau continues to perform well. We are pleased with the progress of the integration. For example, in Q1, Tableau was in 8 of our top 10 deals for the company and in more than 60% of our 7-figure plus deals.
Revenue attrition in Q1 was between 9% and 9.5%. We were -- we continue to be pleased with the progress made on attrition.
Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately $35 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $17.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency.
Turning to operating margins. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, largely driven by revenue outperformance and incremental expense efficiencies. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.50, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.21. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.23 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.24.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $3.2 billion, up 74% year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's cash flow seasonality was impacted by our decision to provide temporary financial flexibility to some of our customers during the pandemic. And we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher in Q1 and Q4. CapEx for the quarter was $171 million, leading to free cash flow of $3.1 billion, up 99% year-over-year.
Before moving on to guidance, I want to update you on the status of the Slack transaction. We remain on track to close in Q2. Now as we've refined our Q2 and full year guidance, we have also refined our expectation on the Slack closing date, which we now expect to be near the very end of the quarter. So I want to emphasize that all guidance assumptions involve -- changes involving Slack are completely timing driven.
So turning to guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $6.22 billion to $6.23 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes no contribution from Slack. For Q2, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 20%. This guidance assumes approximately 3 points of growth from Slack.
As a reminder, Q2 fiscal '21 benefited from strong renewals performance. We expect Q2 GAAP loss per share of negative $0.10 to negative $0.09 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.92. Our assumptions include a $0.09 impact from Slack, primarily driven by OIE and transaction and integration costs.
Now moving to fiscal '22 updates. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $250 million to $25.9 billion to $26 billion or approximately 22% growth year-over-year. And this guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $500 million from Slack due to the changes I mentioned in our closed timing assumptions. Our guidance continues to include $190 million from Acumen. Net of the revised Slack contribution, this represents a $350 million raise on our core business. Our decision to raise fiscal '22 revenue is reflective of our Q1 performance and our confidence in our ability to execute for the rest of the year.
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18%, an expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year. This continues to include an expected 160 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen, continued investment in our core business and the moderate increase of travel in the second half of this year. We are raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.22 to $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted EPS to $3.79 to $3.81.
We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.53 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01.
We are also raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points, now expecting 12% to 13% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and by the refined timing expectations on M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 8 points.
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 12% to 13% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%.
To close, our impressive start to fiscal '22 positions us well for the rest of the year and keeps us on track to achieve our goal of $50 billion by fiscal '26. It really was a terrific quarter, and I'm grateful to our employees for their focus on both growth and efficiency during the quarter.
Finally, it has been a pleasure to meet many of our shareholders over the past few months, and I want to thank all of you for your continued support of Salesforce. 
And with that, Chantal, let's open up the call for questions."

And we also believe that we also have to include all stakeholders, not just our company but our customers and our partners and even consumers.
And I think that Bret has created an incredible vision for the future of work and an incredible platform. And when you think about as well what Slack is going to do in terms of transforming our company, when each one of our clouds become Slack first, well, that, I think, is a huge accelerator in all this.

And more importantly, it's a question on the mind of every CEO in every single one of our customers. When you look at the trends of this past year, like that wonderful Honeywell story that Marc mentioned in his script, they shifted 7,000 salespeople from in-person to virtual customer meetings.
Customer meetings aren't going back to conference rooms only. They're going to stay on Zoom as companies like ours just realize that we can execute as well as ever before in this digital environment. The contact centers that move from being buildings to be in the cloud, thanks to the power of Service Cloud, they're not going back to buildings anymore. When you think about to move from doctors' offices to telemedicine, you look across our portfolio, the move to digital commerce and digital marketing and incredible Cyber Week numbers we talked about last quarter, we really think that this digital Customer 360, this platform we've been building is an absolutely crucial part of the future of work for every single one of our customers, in particular, because things aren't going to snap back to the way they were.
It's also, as Marc mentioned, I think one of the reasons we're so excited about the prospect of closing this Slack transaction. When you think about what does it mean to succeed in the all-digital work-anywhere world, it's Customer 360, which enables you to digitize your entire customer experience and get back to growth in this incredible economy. And it's the digital HQ from Slack, which enables you to connect to all of your employees, all of your partners and all of your customers together in this incredible new engagement platform. And we think the 2 together represent an incredible opportunity that I think is truly the operating system for growth for every company embracing this new way of working and getting back to growth in this new normal."

I think one of the things, if you see the numbers, the strength is really across the portfolio. When we talk about the fact that of those 7-figure deals, they, on average, included more than 4 of our clouds, we're not selling individual products. We're selling a Customer 360 solution to really transform the entire customer experience.
That said, last quarter, I talked a lot about the amazing growth in marketing and e-commerce due to Cyber Week. It's really heartening to see just all aspects of the economy and our portfolio growing. One of the most fun for me this quarter in Sales Cloud, we're seeing over 5 million opportunities created every day. That is almost a 20% increase over last quarter. This is every B2B selling team in the world investing in growth again, recognizing the demand environment we see in the economy at every single part of our customer base.
Another great example of this is that -- and I don't even know if you know this, Marc, but in April, Einstein started doing over 100 billion predictions per day. And it's a great example of these platform investments that we did multiple years ago that our customers, that the whole economy goes digital is really -- are really benefiting from. When you think about what does that mean, it means that every e-mail you get is more personalized. It means that every e-commerce you paid is suited to your interest and your needs, driving growth and success for our customers but really represents, I think, the importance of these foundational technology investments.
And another great example of this, Marc talked about Customer 360, Analytics and Tableau, integration with MuleSoft. You're really seeing the importance of, I'll call it, that technology foundation as it relates to these Customer 360 multi-cloud deployments. MuleSoft is now doing 4.86 billion integration transactions every day. That is up 28% quarter-over-quarter. And it's sort of the boring but important part of this Customer 360, integrating all of those legacy systems so our customers can move faster in the face of an economy that's, I think, shifting more rapidly than ever before and really, I think, shows the importance of our acquisitions as it relates to our overall value proposition of Customer 360."

It looks like there's a ton of momentum at Salesforce right now. Maybe one question for Marc and one for Amy. For Marc, there's been some investor debate on sort of to what degree digital transformations are really accelerating. A lot of other companies had a more mixed or difficult Q1. You guys seem to have really hit it out of the park this Q1. Can you tell us kind of your view on sort of how your customers are changing their investment profiles? And when is that going to hit? Is that something that is really a 2021 event? Or because of the big strategic nature of these deals, this could take some time to flush out? I guess I'm asking, how is the pipeline looking for these big strategic deals?
And then the question for Amy. We were impressed when you sort of stuck it with 17.5% operating margins with the initial FY '22 guide. Now you're raising it another 50 basis points. Can you talk to us about does that come from sort of expenses being pushed out? Or is it just kind of -- is there actual kind of more efficiencies that you're finding in the business that enable you to raise the operating margin guide here?"
122917,713767705,2303296,"salesforce.com, inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Well, I'm so excited that you're excited about Amy's new model. I mean I, by the way, am also -- I mean she -- I think Kash said it well. She has reimagined the business. She has rebalanced our ratios. She's figured out how to take these kind of changes t",703,"Well, I'm so excited that you're excited about Amy's new model. I mean I, by the way, am also -- I mean she -- I think Kash said it well. She has reimagined the business. She has rebalanced our ratios. She's figured out how to take these kind of changes that have occurred in the pandemic, which is less travel and less real estate and less events and kind of rebuilt the company from the bottom up. And I think that's where we're really starting to see Amy's genius kind of take place, which is that -- when I look at the revenue, $5.96 billion, up 23%, 20% in constant currency. The cash flow, $3.23 billion. But then when I really get down into this operating margin at 20.2% but also the ability to raise for the year, it really gets down to this new model that she's really pioneered and has installed in the company. And it's given us a fresh look at how we run our business and what we're going to do in the future, and how we think about the right balance between revenue and cash flow and margin.
And the pandemic gave all of us the ability to reset our lives but also our businesses. And when we look at resetting our businesses, we also have to reset our financial models. And I think that this is the result of now 4 amazing quarters of this financial model emerging. And I think we're going to see that continue to pay out for the rest of the year and future years as well that we will benefit from this. And I don't think it's something that's getting pulled forward or pushed back or this or that. It's all 0-based from the bottom. So that's what's exciting, and it's a commitment that we have to a new model and a new approach. And also this idea, though, it's a new way to work.
Now in regards to the customer focus, I think, well, we just have never seen customer demand like this, and we don't -- there's certain applications that we've been asked not to profile on the call, for example, in regards to some things that the U.S. government has done in terms of making sure that stimulus gets to the right place at the right time. And we were asked to do things in a matter of weeks. It's not just limited to our government. It's other governments. It's other businesses. I mean I've never seen, and I said this in the last couple of calls, so many, what I would call, emergency deployments. Usually, they say, hey, we like to have this in 6 months, 12 months, the most 18 months. That's one of the reasons they come to Salesforce.
Very fast time to value, this is critical. But for us, they want instant time to value. We're like, wait, we have to build this in the cloud. We don't go -- we got to go. All right, we'll build. We'll build it. We'll deliver this. We'll make this happen for you. And I've been so fortunate to have Gavin really by my side during all of this. I mean everybody knows Gavin's tremendous lineage. And Gavin worked -- and I worked together, have been friends for more than a decade. But of course, as the CEO of BT, I was -- always admired his business process and business practice and his ability to bring discipline. But now watching him run our customer organization and what he's done now over the last year, that's just been a shock to me.
But Gavin, I think you should just kind of come in here because it's not just Amy, who's reimagined the financial model. You've reimagined the entire customer model and how we're going to market and the balance of sales and service, and you've reimagined the level of management that we have and where we're putting that management level of capacity, the relevance, the participation, I mean the enablement, these things that you've laid in. So would you just tell us -- give us what's happening on the customer side? And how do you see the market today?"

And 3 words come to mind for me: relevance, investment and execution. Relevance is, I think, really, really clear. What we offer at the moment is what organizations around the world, be those companies or governments, it's what they're looking for to manage their business, and we see that in the new business pipeline. It's extraordinarily strong. Yes, we have a favorable compare, but if you look at the 2-year performance, it's really, really strong. And that's the key number to look at. We're not persuaded by just the year-on-year. It needs to be the 2-year performance with an easy compare. So I think taking advantage of the economy, the strength of investment going into the economy in many places around the world. We're perfectly placed to take advantage of that.
I think the second thing is about investment. So in the mid part of last year, when we were restructuring the business, we also put new investment back into the business, particularly with capacity, and we're seeing the benefit of that now as we come into the year really strong, ready to take advantage of the strong economies we're seeing around the world. So being able to invest when others won't, I think, is a significant factor.
And then the final thing is around execution. We had a really strong, I think, quarter because of the execution and the grip that we've got on the sales and service organization. We had a digital launch this year, and that meant we got all the quotas deployed very, very quickly. We've got more selling days into the quarter. We've got a flatter organization now, so there's really clear accountability throughout the business. And we've seen that turn into great results, great results both in terms of the run rate business but also particularly strong results in the big deals. And Marc talked about some of those numbers.
So the business is really humming. The pipeline is super strong. It's across all clouds. It's across all geographies. There's a real strong focus on industries as well. The business is really, really pumping."

It gave us more 7 days, made sure that everybody was clear what they had to achieve. Their goals were deployed earlier in the year, and that meant we're able to focus on our customers. And that's the most important thing we do.

And I think the CEOs -- I mean I'll tell you from my own. Obviously, we invested last year. We didn't pull back. We knew we had to go for it. And we had to go all out.
And it's counterintuitive. The world is ending, and you have to say, well, you got to go all out and realize that the world is not going to be ending in a year from now. And it's hard when you're in it because people start to panic. It's a normal human reaction. I mean we even had executives in Salesforce who came in and said; ""Oh, we've got to cut. We got to do this. We have to do that."" We reshaped. There's no question, we did some slight reshaping, but we didn't do any massive layoffs or anything like that of any consequence that I would say, oh, we really tried to cut dramatically in some area or whatever. It was like, no, we need to reshape to grow. We need to invest to grow. We need to do the things that we need to do as a company. And that's a year ago.
So a year ago, it was a decision based on experience that is we have seen it, whether it was the recession of 2001 or the financial disasters of 2008. Those are just moments. They're moments in time, but in the history of the company or if you look at the history of the equity from 2004 when we went public, you got to keep going. And that moment is the time to go because, in many cases, your competitors are pulling back because they're afraid. And when your competitors are afraid, that's when you need to invest, and that's where you really need to grow.
And I'll tell you, I think that, that's what Gavin did, that Gavin came in and he reshaped. He took out some -- took out some cost. He advanced certain areas. He rebalanced his org and was able to provide greater market coverage and expanding his capacity, capability and I think at levels I haven't seen in a long time. So do you want to just fill in the details?"

Bret was at the tip of the spear on both of those, making sure that we're prepared for the future with the business plan and the reshaping plan that we needed and the technology plan and the technology vision.
Then Amy came in and she said, no, we're going to rebuild the fundamental financial plan as well, and we're going to couple that financial plan from the bottom up and build a new revenue plan and a new cash flow and margin plan. And you see that now. And then we had Gavin come in and say this is how we're going to rebuild the distribution organization.

I appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland, with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer. And I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Tr",1090,"Well, thank you, Evan. I appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland, with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer. And I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Trustees meeting, and it's been a great experience being here in Geneva. Very much the world is open for business here, and it's great to be meeting with our customers face-to-face and in person and discussing our business with them and talking about their businesses and how their businesses are doing in this new normal. And we're learning quite a bit about how different the U.S. is from Europe right now and also how much has really changed, which is quite a bit. 
So I'm absolutely excited to be here, but I'm also extremely excited to share our phenomenal second quarter results with you. You can really see we had a phenomenal second quarter. We just had a phenomenal second half. You're about to hear we're about to have a phenomenal first half as well. And we're also going to have a good chat about what we're doing with Slack, a very exciting acquisition that's now closed, and you are going to hear about #1 CRM just got better. And it's incredible what's going on with Slack and looking forward to addressing all that with the -- in the script with you. 
So look, we are in a new world. There's no doubt about that. I'm sure that all of us realize that, and we are delivering success from anywhere as well for Salesforce. We've gone through a tremendous transformation, and we're now delivering this new world for our stakeholders. 
And from a business perspective, well, I'd say it's been an absolutely extraordinary 18 months for Salesforce, I know for all of you and certainly for all the CEOs I met with today. We're navigating this global pandemic. We have been guided by our core values of trust, of customer success, of innovation, of quality. But through all this and through our perseverance and through our, I think, dedication to our customers, we've been able to deliver record financial results. And with these results, we've now can say -- and looking over this, we've now had 5 outstanding quarters in a row really delivering the success of our vision. Pretty awesome. 
So let's take a look now at the second quarter because the numbers are incredible. And you can see we delivered our first $6 billion quarter, about $6.3 billion, and continue to maintain our very strong growth rate, our profitability, our cash flow, our margin growth, continue to execute our new operating margin model. And you can see right now, revenue and the growth in the quarter, you can see $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Pretty awesome and above where we thought we were going to be, considerably above. 
And I guess I'm as excited as I am about the revenue. I'm also very excited that as we're executing this new operating margin model, we can see the margin in the quarter was also a very healthy 20.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and also delivered $386 million in operating cash flow. 
For fiscal year '22, we are raising again our guide to $26.3 billion, which is now at the high end of our range. It's a raise of $300 million, and it's going to represent about 24% projected growth year-over-year and just really reflects, I think, how well the company is doing in its core, not just through the Slack acquisition, but you can see organically, especially when you look at the numbers over the last 5 quarters. And we're raising our operating margin to 18.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Again, based on just the outstanding performance of the company, we're able to do some amazing things here with the operating margin. 
I don't think Salesforce has really ever been -- had better execution, better management team, greater momentum. And as I have spoken to so many customers today, I don't think we've ever been more well positioned for them. And I'll say that in 2 areas. One is in our core products. Our focus on customer success, the Customer 360 now with the Slack user interface and everything being Slack first, but also our core values. So many of our customers are attracted to us because, in many cases, they're going through an amazing values transformation and in the areas of -- that we've pioneered. And now especially in regards to sustainability, which we'll talk about because, as you know, Salesforce has been in a net-zero company but now we're fully renewable as well. And as we start to head towards the Fortune 100, I think that a lot of the companies that I met with today were mostly Fortune 100 CEOs. They crave to have that same net zero and renewable profile, which is very exciting to see the world having this kind of sustainability focus. So I'm absolutely thrilled to see how the core business grew in the first half of the year. 
And I am excited about the outlook. I'm excited about our positioning with our customers. And I'll tell you, I'm very excited that 5 out of the last 5 quarters that we've had that 20% or greater revenue growth. And the 3 out of the last 5 quarters, we're having greater than 20% operating margin. I don't think we could have said either of those things 5 quarters ago, So my hat is really off to the management team and to the employees for making this happen. And we're raising our guidance for the fourth time in a row as we see increased opportunities for additional revenue growth and additional operating margin capability this year. 
And look, we're the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever. You know that. You're tracking us. You see where the numbers are going. You can see what the trajectory is, the velocity of the company, both in revenue and margin. And now you can also see that no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level. 
So we are really quite confident and remain on our path to generate $50 billion in revenue by fiscal year '26, which doesn't seem very far away from right now. And when we first gave that number, it didn't seem as -- it didn't -- it seems like it was so far away. Now it seems like, wow, this is going to happen."

Thanks, Marc, for that amazing introduction and just a reflection on the momentum in the company right now. 
It really was just an incredible quarter. Our products are more relevant than ever, and I have never seen this kind of momentum in the business. And honestly, that's because CRM is more strategic now than it's ever been. Every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And that's why around the world, more and more companies are putting their trust in Salesforce to help them get back to growth. That's the agenda on every CEO's mind in Switzerland, and it's on the mind of every Board around the world. 
IDC just released our April 2021 SaaS path vendor rating. It's a survey of more than 2,000 companies worldwide, and Salesforce has rated #1 in trust, #1 in product, #1 in industry specialization and #1 in value for the price. That is just amazing. 
It's a true measure of just how mission-critical we are to our customers. And you can just see it in the incredibly strong performance of all of our clouds this quarter. 
Sales Cloud has been #1 in its category for more than a decade. And this year, we've reimagined the product to be the growth platform for digital sales teams. We are already seeing the results as Sales Cloud accelerated to 15% growth year-over-year. 
Our Service Cloud is also seeing amazing momentum. All aspects of customer service has gone digital from the contact center to field service to self-service and to bots. The scale of Service Cloud is just incredible. This is a $6 billion business whose growth has accelerated to 23% year-over-year. 
Our Marketing and Commerce Cloud also grew 28% year-over-year as every organization in the world is investing in direct trusted relationship with our customers. 
And every one of these digital transformations is also a data transformation, which is driving the unprecedented success we're seeing in Tableau and MuleSoft. Tableau is in 9 of our top 10 deals this quarter, and MuleSoft was in 8 of our top 10 deals. 
The real power of Salesforce platform is bringing all of these capabilities together into a Customer 360, a single source of truth for your customers. Our industry strategy is enabling our customers to get started with an end-to-end Customer 360 faster than ever before, tailored to the specific needs of every industry. 
Our Industry Cloud saw 58% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue. We had especially strong performance in the public sector, in our Health Cloud business and financial services. In fact, 4 of our top 10 deals in the second quarter came from the public sector. 
Our core organic business has never been stronger, just like Marc said. And now with Slack, we're bringing a whole new dimension to Salesforce. There could not be a more relevant product at a more relevant time for every single one of our customers. 
If you talk to any CEO, read the headline of any paper or even look around the home office most of you are sitting in right now, you can see the depth of the transformation work has gone through this year. Sales meetings have moved from conference rooms to Slack and to Zoom, contact centers used to be buildings. And now they exist entirely in the cloud. My commute has moved from the highway to primarily my hallway. Slack is at the center of this. Slack is how organizations all around the world are finding success in this all-digital work in the old world. It's your digital HQ. It connects your employees, your partners, your customers on a single platform and a platform that people love to use. 
And the Slack First Customer 360 makes every Salesforce product more powerful and more effective for our customers. Our engineering teams have really hit the ground running on this integration. Just last week, we announced our Slack first sales, service, marketing analytics at our launch event. And we've got a ton of Slack innovation coming at Dreamforce. 
IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack First Customer 360 company. Arvind Krishna is a close friend of mine. And in talking, he talked about how he believes that bringing Salesforce and Slack together is key for IBM to become even more connected, even more productive and more innovative. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530,000 customers, 380,000 employees and 50,000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud, across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere. Slack comes up in every single one of my customer conversations, and I could not be more thrilled with the momentum in the business. 
Slack's revenue accelerated to 39% growth year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, and they have great customer wins at Target, Lowe's, Conde Nast, UNICEF, Norton Healthcare. Now what's really fun about this is looking at the growth of Slack Connect. We've talked a lot about this. Slack Connect is the capability to enable you to connect, not just with your fellow employees, but to connect with your partners, with your vendors and your customers. Slack Connect grew 200% year-over-year. This really illustrates the power of not just Slack for employee engagement, but the Slack-First Customer 360. 
Slack is a once in a generation company that is transforming in the way we work, and it's transforming the vision we have for our company over the next decade. 
I am so grateful to be able to work with Stuart and the Slack team every day, and I'm really excited to bring this vision of the Slack-First Customer 360 to all of our customers. And if the technology gods will allow, I'd love to transfer it over to Gavin to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. Gavin, are you on?"

[Audio Gap] momentum we're seeing in the business. And you can see that really reflected in some of the remarkable customer wins we saw not just in the U.S. but around the world in the last quarter. 
But starting in the U.S., we saw our largest ever deal based on new annual recurring revenue, which is in the public sector. And as Bret said, public sector has been fantastic for us in the second quarter. 
Other examples, we expanded relationships with great companies like PayPal and Coinbase. While in EMEA, we have significant wins behind with Elran, who own things like Safelite and Autogas, Fresh Fields, Dyson, Vodafone and a cracking business, Canyon Bicycles, which is a really great case study. And then in APAC, we continue to deepen our relationships with many businesses, but including the sites Afterpay and SWD Thailand. So we're seeing strength internationally as well as in the U.S. 
Now a couple of examples I want to go into a little bit more detail on it. And one is a win with MillerKnoll. You might remember more as Herman Miller, but it's fantastic example of a company pivoting with a great digital customer experience. So back at the start of the pandemic, MillerKnoll saw a huge spike in demand for their firm, not surprisingly. Of course, they turned to Salesforce to transform their e-commerce experience in the quarter, and we're already seeing a significant improvement in conversion rates on the back of that. Since then, they've been providing an even better experience, tailored product recommendations, a streamlined checkout experience and next-generation video chat. 
And on top of that, MillerKnoll is a net-zero company. And they're now using Salesforce Sustainability Cloud to track their carbon footprint and other climate-related initiatives. So you can see it's a great example of how we're building partnerships, building multi-cloud solutions around the Customer 360, and we go from strength to strength. 
I wanted to talk about RBC Wealth Management, which is another great win in the quarter. They're using the Customer 360 to streamline processes, integrate data from over 26 different systems to create a unified wealth management platform that provides advisers with a 360-degree view of every client. And I think that's something that really brings the customer life for more than 2,100 RBC financial advisers. 
I think this example, to me, I think, is very powerful. They've been using Salesforce workflow automation to transform the client onboarding process, which was several weeks, more than 100 pages of physical documents, and it is now a digital task that takes just 24 minutes.  And that is quite remarkable, I think. 
GEICO was a great win in the quarter. needs no introduction, of course. But in case you don't know about GEICO, it is the second largest auto insurer in the U.S. And they're really leaning into the power of the 360, the Customer 360 to create a single view of their customers across the heart entire business. And now more than 25,000 agents are going to be putting their trust in that Customer 360, which is now providing AI-powered analytics to improve those customer relationships. 
And 3M. Now this is one we've talked about in the past. You've heard Marc talk about how they've been using the Customer 360 across 83 countries. But that relationship continues to expand. Now 3M using Trailhead to train thousands of customer-facing employees as they join the company. Salesforce Maps, is now being used as part of their proposition. Tableau CRM is giving actual intelligence to better manage operations engage with customers dose productivity. 
And then in Q2, 3M selected our Philanthropy Cloud to help empower nearly 100,000 employees to give back to their communities with the goal of achieving 2 million employee volunteer hours over the next 5 years. I think that's a really, really powerful example. 
And then one more, just before I hand over to Amy, and it's IKEA. So  fantastic business over here in Europe, another great example of the Customer 360. We've already been helping them with marketing. They've been getting great ROI with Market Cloud across over 30 markets. Now as home improvements were soaring in the pandemic, they turned to us to use field service to help schedule in-home planning business, installations after service support across the U.S. So another example of how we're building our relationships, adding clouds to existing customers going increasingly into partnership-type relationships. 
So I think these are a few examples. There are many more, but they are all, I think, examples of how we're helping customers deliver success from wherever they are from anywhere. 
So net-net, my conversations with customers, I think, have given me great confidence, not just in the demand for our products and services, but I think in our ability to execute in the second half of the year. So it's both demand and execution. So I continue to see this being maintained going forward. So there's a really strong demand environment across Salesforce in the second half. And I think Slack is really going to enhance that. 
So just before I hand over to Amy, I'd just like to say a quick thank you to the amazing effort of the sales teams around the world. They've been able to adapt to a different way of working a new normal and in doing so, we've been able to continue to support our customers. And I'd like to thank them for that. Amy, over to you."
122917,1675928842,2386101,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2021",2021-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of remarkable top and bottom line performance. We exceeded our top line expectations, achieving record levels of Q2 new business. We saw strong demand across all of our products",1497,"Great. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of remarkable top and bottom line performance. We exceeded our top line expectations, achieving record levels of Q2 new business. We saw strong demand across all of our products, regions and customer sizes. And we were able to execute with discipline to drive higher operating income. 
We also completed the acquisition of Slack Technologies on July 21, bringing yet another best-in-class asset into our Customer 360. We believe that Slack will play a critical role in the digital transformation of our customers as they reimagine the future of work in a digital-first work from anywhere environment. And that process is already underway with Flex business accelerating into the close of the acquisition. 
In Q2, Slack's revenue grew 39% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, which excludes any impact of purchase accounting. Slack also saw strong performance in customer acquisition, especially in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated during the quarter, up 41%. 
For the short period between the close of the deal and the end of our fiscal Q2, Slack's operating results were immaterial to our non-GAAP results, and they are included below the line in OIE. Slack is consequently excluded from our reported revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Where appropriate, we will call out Slack-specific impact on our Q2 results and our guidance. As part of the acquisition, this quarter, we issued $8 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.25% and weighted average maturity of 20 years. We were very pleased by the terms we've received on what we view as an inexpensive source of capital. 
In particular, I'd like to call attention to the strong reception of our $1 billion sustainability bond, which was our most oversubscribed note in the offering. And not only did we raise funds on favorable terms, but concurrent with our debt raise, S&P upgraded our credit rating to A. 
Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q2 fiscal '22, starting with top line commentary. 
Total revenue for the second quarter was $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 21% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we've discussed the last few quarters enabled us to deliver these results as new business momentum continued to exceed our expectations. 
A few key highlights. We saw acceleration in Sales Cloud with Q2 revenue of $1.5 billion or 15% year-over-year growth. Tableau and MuleSoft continued their momentum in enterprise deals as both saw their share of the company's top 10 deals increase. As Bret noted, Tableau was in 9 of the top 10 and MuleSoft in 8 of the top 10 deals this quarter. This is an incredible accomplishment and evidence of how strategic these acquisitions have become for our customers. Public sector continues to be an area of strength, accounting for 4 of the top 10 deals this quarter. 
And again, this quarter, our 7-figure deals on average included more than 4.5 clouds. The number of 7-figure deals, including 5 or more clouds, grew by 29% year-over-year, showing continued momentum in our enterprise deals. And we continue to see strength in our international businesses, which accelerated sequentially, although we will note that EMEA and APAC growth benefited modestly from the integration of acquisitions into our billing practices. 
We remain pleased with the progress on attrition with revenue attrition in Q2 between 8% and 8.5%, an improvement from last quarter's 9% to 9.5%. Attrition has continued to perform better than anticipated. As a reminder, our attrition rate is calculated based on trailing 12-month performance, and we have now lapped the second quarter of fiscal '21, which was impacted by the early days of the pandemic. 
Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $36.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.7 billion, up 23%, both year-over-year and in constant currency. 
Slack represents 4 points of growth, ahead of the 3 points we guided to last quarter due primarily to changes in our assumptions around purchase accounting. 
Turning to operating margin. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. Salesforce recorded $45 million of transaction-related costs due to closing the Slack acquisition during the quarter. 
Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.48. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.42 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.43. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $386 million, down 10% year-over-year. On a cash basis, Salesforce paid $43 million of transaction fees related to the Slack acquisition.  
CapEx for quarter was $213 million, leading to free cash flow of $173 million, down 45% year-over-year. And as a reminder, we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher to Q1 and Q4. Slack's operating results had no impact to Q2 operating cash flow or CapEx. 
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue of $6.78 billion to $6.79 billion or approximately 25% of growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $250 million contribution from Slack. For Q3, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 22%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. 
We expect Q3 GAAP EPS of negative $0.06 to negative $0.05 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.92. 
Now moving to fiscal '22 guidance updates. As a result of our year-to-date performance and strong execution in the current demand environment, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $300 million to $26.2 billion to $26.3 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $530 million from Slack in the second half of fiscal '22, an increase of $30 million over our previous guide. This guidance also includes $200 million from Acumen, an increase of $10 million from our previous guide. Net of the revised Slack and Acumen contributions, this represents a $260 million raise on our core business. Our ability to execute in the demand environment both remain strong. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18.5%, representing an expansion of 80 basis points year-over-year. This now includes an expected 150 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen or 10 basis points less headwind compared to our previous guidance. Excluding this 10 basis point adjustment, our operating margin guidance represents a 40 basis point raise compared to our previous guidance. 
We are also raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.81 to $0.83 and raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $4.36 to $4.38. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.51 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. 
We are raising our fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points, now expecting 14% to 15% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and lower headwind from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 7 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 21% to 22%. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%. 
To close, we remain excited by the strength we see in the demand environment, and we're seeing record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw acceleration this quarter. We closed our largest deal in customer history. We had an impressive first half of fiscal '22, and we're excited to continue to Slack's momentum with the power of our 2 companies now together. And the increased revenue guidance reflects the confidence we have in the fundamentals of our business, and we remain well on our way to achieving our goal of $50 billion in fiscal '26. We are committed to being disciplined along the way while challenging ourselves to find additional areas of operational improvement. 
I want to say thank you to all of our employees for being able to focus on disciplined, efficient growth during the quarter. And we're looking forward to further strengthening the durability of our operating model going forward. 
And finally, I look forward to engaging with many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 23. I'll now turn the call back to Marc for some final comments."

So turns out the cell phone technology is the big winner. So anyway, thanks, Amy, and that was a great job on earnings, and congratulations on another great quarter organization, everything you're doing. I couldn't be  more excited about the strength of our core business, our revenue growth, our margin growth, our cash flow growth as well as the addition of Slack now to our team of unicorns, if you will. I mean, it's absolutely true, the best CRM just got better with Slack. And I listen to what Bret has to say about the integration of incredible things like Slack Connect. These are becoming extensions to our CRM capabilities. So it's a very exciting moment for our entire product line and our technology team. 
And I think that with that, our leadership team has really shown through this amazing perseverance and execution over the last several quarters, these amazing results. 
Now we're going to have our digital Dreamforce coming up in San Francisco in less than a month from September 21 through September 23, and we'll have tens of millions of customers from all over the world, tuning with us, and we'll have hundreds of customers with us live in San Francisco as well. So it's going to be extremely exciting. We want you all to have a front row seat. And please talk to Evan, so you're all connected to this program. 
And we will also be redeploying our Dreamforce 2U program as well, delivering custom Dreamforce capability for all of our customers. So I hope that you're all going to join us. 
Okay. So as Amy mentioned, we're also looking forward to having you then at Investor Day. That will also be amazing, and we're expecting some awesome conversations with all of you. 
So with that, I'll open it up to questions. So everybody is online right now, and we can take all your questions. So go ahead, Evan."

And actually, I think we've made a faster start integrating our technologies than any acquisition or history. 
We did an event last week on this idea of a digital HQ where we announced Slack sales, things like deal rooms inside of Slack Connect integrated with Sales Cloud. Slack first service, which are things like case swarming for digital customer service teams, Slack first marketing and Slack first analytics. So those capabilities are going to be in the hands of our customers soon and we have a lot more innovation coming at Dreamforce as well. 
And with that, you asked what we're measuring, it's -- as you said, it's going to show up in things like multi-cloud deals that include Slack. It's also going to show up in a lot more departments and a lot more companies who are perhaps using these new digital collaboration technologies for the first time in the context of doing their job, in the context of customer service, in the context of sales, in the context of marketing and really realizing this vision of a digital HQ. 
I think Marc has talked a lot about how we're in this new pandemic world. This isn't going away. And we've opened half of our offices. But as you can imagine, not as many people are showing up as we had hoped to at this point, because of this pandemic. I've started 2 companies and started by planning my office space. And now if you're starting a company, you start by planning your digital HQ. 
And that's really what we want to bring to every company in the world, help them build the digital infrastructure to help them succeed in this new normal. And one thing that I think we're really excited about that Marc also mentioned is Slack Connect, which is really bringing these digital tools outside of the walls of our customers' buildings and bringing them to partners and customers as well, and you've seen that in a lot of the product integrations we announced. ."

Since we announced the deal 6 months ago, 9 months ago, obviously, we've been having conversations with customers about what we're planning to do, recognizing in the needing to go through the DOJ process. And I have to say, Randy come across a product that has the [indiscernible], the excitement, the customer advocacy that Slack does. It really is quite remarkable. So there's, I think, huge interest out there amongst customers. Many of our customers are both Salesforce customers and now site customers. So there's good overlap between the 2, and they can see the synergy that we're going to have from a product perspective. 
We are beginning to sell through Slack. The most powerful presentation the sales teams give are often Salesforce-on-Salesforce. And so Slack-on-Slack is a very compelling way to explain how we use the product. And so we're beginning to do more and more of that. And where we are closing deals, we're leaning in to close deals through closing the deal itself on Slack creating channels between us and the customer and ensuring that everybody who's working on the deal can real-time access to those channels. And it is meaning that the deals close much more quickly. So in fact, the Slack deal itself was closed on Slack. So that is the perfect example of Slack on Slack. Amy?"

So Mark, turning to your other question about operating margin. So where we have really seen them growing this year? First, we are gaining the benefit of very strong business performance in Q1 and Q2, and that does allow us room to provide profitability. And that's while still investing in growth and absorbing the impacts of M&A. 
And second, we are continuing to build on what we learned during the pandemic about how we can work effectively in a digital-first or a hybrid environment. Some examples of that virtual go-to-market motions, sales enablement, which is largely virtual at this point or digital and also a renewed emphasis on financial automation, which I believe will pay off in the long run. 
And then finally, it's simply an approach of disciplined decision-making. And when we're saying that investment opportunities, we're taking a very hard we are challenging ourselves, and we're finding ways to shift our operating model where necessary. ."

But I think it really shows just our philosophy on our M&A and why I think we've had really unprecedented success in the marketplace and integrating our acquisitions successfully. 
We really try to integrate our platform. And with Tableau, with MuleSoft, with Slack, this all amplifies our vision for our customer 360. At the center of all these digital transformations, our customers are going through is data. You need to integrate that data with MuleSoft, you need to see and understand it with Tableau, and you need to act on that. And that's all going to happen with Slack, which is the system of engagement for the Customer 360 but also the system of engagement for every application at your company. So I think it's an incredibly powerful combination. And I actually think Slack has the potential to really accelerate every single product in the Customer 360. Tableau included and Tableau, especially, you're really, I think it has potential across the board. And then it really goes to just this fundamental shift in the workplace we're all experiencing. All of you are probably working from home right now or most of you are. This digital HQ is at the center of every single 1 of the transformations we're bringing to our customers. ."

And as I look into the second half of the year, I see that continuing. The pipeline is really strong the conversations we're having with customers are accelerating, if anything. And so we chose to make a decision 3 months ago because we could see this demand in the marketplace. We chose to increase our investment in our direct Salesforce to get a coverage with customers. And that is a sign of our confidence in the business. So I feel very confident that we can continue to grow top line while delivering on expectations around operating margin, it isn't to trade off. I think there's a balance that we can get between the 2. Take your -- we seize the opportunities in the marketplace. We're able to serve that demand.

So digital customer transformation is no longer something that is delegated down the organization. It's a conversation that's going on in the boardroom, CEO priority.

And the real focus is on time to value, which is good for us. We want as much -- we are not just on standard products as much as possible, configuring yes, customizing not so much because there's so much innovation coming through early it's easier to do through staying on the standard path. 
So it's either in the U.S. or in Europe, we're seeing our business grow across the board, both in terms of small customers on one end, the SMB market, all the way up to multinationals. We're seeing increasingly bigger deals, And we highlighted our biggest ever deal in terms of recurring revenue in this quarter into public sector deal, but we're seeing more and more not just $1 million-plus deals, but $10 million deals coming through the business And I think that's a sign of, I think, the increasing importance of the Salesforce offer and what it means to businesses."

And I think this echos comment from both Marc and Amy. I don't recall this type of raise to the full year guide in terms of top line revenues are definitely not the type of rate to the operating margin guide historically, especially in the first half of the year. 
Maybe Gavin or Marc, you could talk to you, what are you guys seeing in the pipeline that's giving you the confidence to increase guidance in the first half of the year for the second half of the year already? 
And maybe to Amy, when we see this operating margin expansion, is this durable, if you will, on a go-forward basis? And in particular, should we be thinking about T&E expenses or some of the kind of reflation of that OpEx line that might be being pushed out because of Delta variant or sort of a slower reopening phase into future years? Or is this margin expansion going to be more durable?"

And so many of the CEO conversations that we're having and let me emphasize the ones I'm having in Europe. Number one, because of the Green New Deal that's happening here in Europe, every CEO here is focused on their net-zero transformation, and they realized that for them to continue to be successful in this environment in this economy, they're having to make that net zero  transformation. And that's been very important to us. We've already made that transformation, and now we're fully renewable as well, as I mentioned, 
The second thing is, I think every CEO that I mentioned, talked to today and yesterday and probably in conversations that I've had over the last several months are going through all types of supply chain challenges. I'm sure you're hearing that in your own checks with your clients, but that's been very surprising to me. And I would say that's the second CEO priority. And then I'd say the 3 CEO priority is exactly what we've been talking about here, which is success from anywhere in this new world. They realize their employees are not coming back exactly as they wanted. I have some stories about when we first started talking about success from anywhere that employees would have a choice between office one, maybe working in an environment like we had last week in Hawaii with our lime program or, as you know, we're building this new ranch. CEOs who call me and say, ""Marc, you don't understand it. Everybody is coming back. Everything is going back the way it is, and then it's over. And I think now those calls have stopped and people realize things have really changed. This pandemic has changed things and work has changed. 
And when we talk about Digital HQ, we might have been talking about digital HQ before the pandemic. But after the pandemic, it means something very different. And I think that what Bret said kind of on the fly there, which was very powerful that, he's obviously has been an incredible entrepreneur as well as an operating executive several companies. But if you were starting a new company, he's not planning has physical office place. He's planning this digital office space. And we're running this call now on a cell phone and on Zoom. And it's a very much an example of success from anywhere. 
But every company has to make this transformation. And that is what is driving our success going forward. This is not a small transformation. This is not a small change. This is why we would pay $27 billion for Slack. We believe so strongly that the world has changed, that the past is gone, that we are in a new world. And yes, we may -- I don't think the Delta variant will be material to our business. If anything, it only accelerates it. And Delta is not last -- the last one of these things that we're going to see, we're seeing a constant now parade of these variants going by. We started with Alpha. And I don't know how many letters they are in the Greek alphabet. -- but delta is not the last letter. So we know that. 
In fact, here in Europe, if you haven't read about what happened with Lambda 2 weeks ago, you probably should. But in all of those things, we're looking to life has to go on, and it is. And if you were here with me today, and you say, well, there's probably some risk to what's going on. There probably is. But I'm vaccinated, Gavin's vaccinated and we're running our business. And that is really the power, and that is the future of what's going on. And I think that this is what we all have to kind of get our head around. And I think in San Francisco, it's very different than how it is right here in Geneva Switzerland, let me tell you. It's very, very different. I was in office buildings today there's nobody in my office building right now. But -- and also people are not wearing masks and toughest buildings here. Everybody is supposed to wear a mask legally in San Francisco right now. So things are different. And this is what is amplifying us. So we're in a tremendous new world and Salesforce has never been more positioned or well, I would say Salesforce has never been better as for an economy and for a world. The first thing that I heard from Gavin was we're open for business, and this is where we're going. Do you want to add to that?"

Appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer. And I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Trust",1091,"Well, thank you, Evan. Appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer. And I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Trustees meeting, and it's been a great experience being here in Geneva. Very much the world is open for business here, and it's great to be meeting with our customers face-to-face and in person and discussing our business with them and talking about their businesses and how their businesses are doing in this new normal. And we're learning quite a bit about how different the U.S. is from Europe right now and also how much has really changed, which is quite a bit.
So I'm absolutely excited to be here, but I'm also extremely excited to share our phenomenal second quarter results with you. You can really see we had a phenomenal second quarter. We just had a phenomenal second half. You're about to hear we're about to have a phenomenal first half as well. And we're also going to have a good chat about what we're doing with Slack, a very exciting acquisition that's now closed. And you are going to hear about #1 CRM just got better. And it's incredible what's going on with Slack, and looking forward to addressing all that with the -- in the script with you.
So look, we are in a new world. There's no doubt about that. I'm sure that all of us realize that, and we are delivering success from anywhere as well for Salesforce. We've gone through a tremendous transformation, and we're now delivering this new world for our stakeholders. 
And from a business perspective, well, I'd say it's been an absolutely extraordinary 18 months for Salesforce, I know for all of you and certainly for all the CEOs I met with today. We're navigating this global pandemic. We have been guided by our core values of trust, of customer success, of innovation, of quality. But through all this and through our perseverance and through our, I think, dedication to our customers, we've been able to deliver record financial results. And with these results, we've now -- can say -- and looking over this, we've now had 5 outstanding quarters in a row really delivering the success of our vision. Pretty awesome.
So let's take a look now at the second quarter because the numbers are incredible. And you can see we delivered our first $6 billion quarter, about $6.3 billion, and continue to maintain our very strong growth rate, our profitability, our cash flow, our margin growth, continue to execute our new operating margin model. And you can see right now, revenue and the growth in the quarter, you can see $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Pretty awesome and above where we thought we were going to be, considerably above.
And I guess I'm -- as excited as I am about the revenue, I'm also very excited that as we're executing this new operating margin model, we can see the margin in the quarter was also a very healthy, 20.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and also delivered $386 million in operating cash flow.
For fiscal year '22, we are raising again our guide to $26.3 billion, which is now at the high end of our range. It's a raise of $300 million, and it's going to represent about 24% projected growth year-over-year and just really reflects, I think, how well the company is doing in its core, not just through the Slack acquisition, but you can see organically, especially when you look at the numbers over the last 5 quarters. And we're raising our operating margin to 18.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Again, based on just the outstanding performance of the company, we're able to do some amazing things here with the operating margin.
I don't think Salesforce has really ever been -- had better execution, better management team, greater momentum. And as I have spoken to so many customers today, I don't think we've ever been more well positioned for them. And I'll say that in 2 areas. One is in our core products, our focus on customer success, the Customer 360 now with the Slack user interface and everything being Slack first, but also our core values. 
So many of our customers are attracted to us because, in many cases, they're going through an amazing values transformation and in the areas of -- that we've pioneered. And now especially in regards to sustainability, which we'll talk about because, as you know, Salesforce has been a net 0 company, but now we're fully renewable as well. And as we start to head towards the Fortune 100, I think that -- a lot of the companies that I met with today were mostly Fortune 100 CEOs. They crave to have that same net 0 and renewable profile, which is very exciting to see the world having this kind of sustainability focus. 
So I'm absolutely thrilled to see how the core business grew in the first half of the year. And I am excited about the outlook. I'm excited about our positioning with our customers. And I'll tell you, I'm very excited that 5 out of the last 5 quarters that we've had that 20% or greater revenue growth. And 3 out of the last 5 quarters, we're having greater than 20% operating margin. I don't think we could have said either of those things 5 quarters ago. So my hat is really off to the management team and to the employees for making this happen. And we're raising our guidance for the fourth time in a row as we see increased opportunities for additional revenue growth and additional operating margin capability this year.
And look, we're the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever. You know that. You're tracking us. You see where the numbers are going. You can see what the trajectory is, the velocity of the company, both in revenue and margin. And now you can also see that no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level.
So we are really quite confident and remain on our path to generate $50 billion in revenue by fiscal year '26, which doesn't seem very far away from right now. And when we first gave that number, it didn't seem as -- it didn't -- it seems like it was so far away. Now it seems like, wow, this is going to happen."

This is Bret Taylor. I'm going to continue with the script. Thanks, Marc, for that amazing introduction and just a reflection on the momentum in the company right now.
It really was just an incredible quarter. Our products are more relevant than ever, and I have never seen this kind of momentum in the business. And honestly, that's because CRM is more strategic now than it's ever been. Every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And that's why around the world, more and more companies are putting their trust in Salesforce to help them get back to growth. That's the agenda on every CEO's mind in Switzerland, and it's on the mind of every Board around the world.
IDC just released our April 2021 SaaSPath Vendor Rating. It's a survey of more than 2,000 companies worldwide, and Salesforce has rated #1 in trust, #1 in product, #1 in industry specialization and #1 in value for the price. That is just amazing. It's a true measure of just how mission-critical we are to our customers. And you can just see it in the incredibly strong performance of all of our clouds this quarter.
Sales Cloud has been #1 in its category for more than a decade. And this year, we've reimagined the product to be the growth platform for digital sales teams. We are already seeing the results as Sales Cloud accelerated to 15% growth year-over-year.
Our Service Cloud is also seeing amazing momentum. All aspects of customer service has gone digital, from the contact center to field service to self-service and to bots. The scale of Service Cloud is just incredible. This is a $6 billion business whose growth has accelerated to 23% year-over-year.
Our Marketing and Commerce Cloud also grew 28% year-over-year as every organization in the world is investing in direct trusted relationship with our customers. And every one of these digital transformations is also a data transformation, which is driving the unprecedented success we're seeing in Tableau and MuleSoft. Tableau is in 9 of our top 10 deals this quarter, and MuleSoft was in 8 of our top 10 deals.
The real power of Salesforce platform is bringing all of these capabilities together into a Customer 360, a Single Source of Truth for your customers. Our industry strategy is enabling our customers to get started with an end-to-end Customer 360 faster than ever before, tailored to the specific needs of every industry.
Our Industry Cloud saw 58% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue. We had especially strong performance in the public sector, in our Health Cloud business and financial services. In fact, 4 of our top 10 deals in the second quarter came from the public sector.
Our core organic business has never been stronger, just like Marc said. And now with Slack, we're bringing a whole new dimension to Salesforce. There could not be a more relevant product at a more relevant time for every single one of our customers.
If you talk to any CEO, read the headline of any paper or even look around the home office most of you are sitting in right now, you can see the depth of the transformation work has gone through this year. Sales meetings have moved from conference rooms to Slack and to Zoom. Contact centers used to be buildings, and now they exist entirely in the cloud. My commute has moved from the highway to primarily my hallway. 
Slack is at the center of this. Slack is how organizations all around the world are finding success in this all-digital work anywhere world. It's your digital HQ. It connects your employees, your partners, your customers on a single platform and a platform that people love to use.
And the Slack-First Customer 360 makes every Salesforce product more powerful and more effective for our customers. Our engineering teams have really hit the ground running on this integration. Just last week, we announced our Slack-First sales, service, marketing and analytics at our launch event. And we've got a ton of Slack innovation coming at Dreamforce.
IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack-First Customer 360 company. Arvind Krishna is a close friend of mine. And in talking to him, he talked about how he believes that bringing Salesforce and Slack together is key for IBM to become even more connected, even more productive and more innovative. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530,000 customers, 380,000 employees and 50,000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud, across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere. 
Slack comes up in every single one of my customer conversations, and I could not be more thrilled with the momentum in the business. Slack's revenue accelerated to 39% growth year-over-year on a stand-alone basis. And they have great customer wins at Target, Lowe's, Conde Nast, UNICEF, Norton Healthcare. 
Now what's really fun about this is looking at the growth of Slack Connect. We've talked a lot about this. Slack Connect is the capability to enable you to connect not just with your fellow employees but to connect with your partners, with your vendors and your customers. Slack Connect grew 200% year-over-year. This really illustrates the power of not just Slack for employee engagement but the Slack-First Customer 360. Slack is a once-in-a-generation company that is transforming the way we work, and it's transforming the vision we have for our company over the next decade.
I am so grateful to be able to work with Stewart and the Slack team every day, and I'm really excited to bring this vision of the Slack-First Customer 360 to all of our customers. 
And if the technology Gods will allow, I'd love to transfer it over to Gavin to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. Gavin, are you on?"

[Audio Gap]
momentum we're seeing in the business. And you can see that really reflected in some of the remarkable customer wins we saw not just in the U.S. but around the world in the last quarter.
But starting in the U.S., we saw our largest-ever deal based on new annual recurring revenue, which is in the public sector. And as Bret said, public sector has been fantastic for us in the second quarter. Other examples, we expanded relationships with great companies like PayPal and Coinbase. While in EMEA, we have significant wins behind with Belron, who own things like Safelite and AutoGlass, Freshfields, Dyson, Vodafone and a cracking business, Canyon Bicycles, which is a really great case study. And then in APAC, we continue to deepen our relationships with many businesses, including things like Afterpay and FWD Thailand. So we're seeing strength internationally as well as in the U.S.
Now a couple of examples I want to go into a little bit more detail on. One is a win with MillerKnoll. You might remember them more as Herman Miller, but it's a fantastic example, a company pivoting with great digital customer experience. So back at the start of the pandemic, MillerKnoll saw a huge spike in demand for their furniture, not surprisingly. Of course, they turned to Salesforce to transform their e-commerce experience in the quarter and are already seeing a significant improvement in conversion rates on the back of that. Since then, they've been providing an even better experience, tailored product recommendations, a streamlined checkout experience and next-generation video chat. 
And on top of that, MillerKnoll is a net 0 company. And they're now using Salesforce Sustainability Cloud to track their carbon footprint and other climate-related initiatives. So you can see it's a great example of how we're building partnerships, building multi-cloud solutions around the Customer 360, and we go from strength to strength.
I wanted to talk about RBC Wealth Management, which is another great win in the quarter. They're using the Customer 360 to streamline processes, integrate data from over 26 different systems to create a unified wealth management platform that provides advisers with a 360-degree view of every client. And I think that's something that really brings the Customer 360 to life for more than 2,100 RBC financial advisers. 
I think this example, to me, I think, is very powerful. They've been using Salesforce workflow automation to transform the client onboarding process, which was several weeks, more than 100 pages of physical documents, and it is now a digital task that takes just 24 minutes. And that is quite remarkable, I think.
GEICO was a great win in the quarter. Needs no introduction, of course. But in case you don't know about GEICO, it is the second largest auto insurer in the U.S. And they're really leaning into the power of the 360, the Customer 360, to create a single view of their customers across the heart -- entire business and with now more than 25,000 agents, are going to be putting their trust in that Customer 360, which is now providing AI-powered analytics to improve those customer relationships.
And 3M. Now this is one we've talked about in the past. You've heard Marc talk about how they've been using the Customer 360 across 83 countries. But that relationship continues to expand. Now 3M is using Trailhead to train thousands of customer-facing employees as they join the company. Salesforce Maps is now being used as part of their proposition. Tableau CRM is giving actual intelligence to better manage operations, engage with customers, boost productivity.
And then in Q2, 3M selected our Philanthropy Cloud to help empower nearly 100,000 employees to give back to their communities with the goal of achieving 2 million employee volunteer hours over the next 5 years. I think that's a really, really powerful example.
And then one more just before I hand over to Amy, and it's IKEA. So IKEA, fantastic business over here in Europe, another great example of the Customer 360. We've already been helping them with marketing. They've been getting great ROI with Market Cloud across over 30 markets. Now as home improvements were soaring in the pandemic, they turned to us to use Field Service to help schedule in-home planning business, installations, after-service support across the U.S. So another example of how we're building our relationships, adding clouds to existing customers, going increasingly into partnership-type relationships.
So I think these are a few examples. There are many more, but they are all, I think, examples of how we're helping customers deliver success from wherever they are, from anywhere.
So net-net, my conversations with customers, I think, have given me great confidence not just in the demand for our products and services but I think in our ability to execute in the second half of the year. So it's both demand and execution. So I continue to see this being maintained going forward. There's a really strong demand environment across Salesforce in the second half. And I think Slack is really going to enhance that.
So just before I hand over to Amy, I'd just like to say a quick thank you to the amazing effort of the sales teams around the world. They've been able to adapt to a different way of working, a new normal. And in doing so, we've been able to continue to support our customers. And I'd like to thank them for that. 
So Amy, over to you."

We saw strong demand across all of our products, regions and customer sizes. And we were able to execute with discipline to drive higher operating income.
We also completed the acquisition of Slack Technologies on July 21, bringing yet another best-in-class asset into our Customer 360. We believe that Slack will play a critical role in the digital transformation of our customers as they reimagine the future of work in a digital-first work-from-anywhere environment. And that process is already underway with Slack's business accelerating into the close of the acquisition.
In Q2, Slack's revenue grew 39% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, which excludes any impact of purchase accounting. Slack also saw strong performance in customer acquisition, especially in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated during the quarter, up 41%.
For the short period between the close of the deal and the end of our fiscal Q2, Slack's operating results were immaterial to our non-GAAP results, and they are included below the line in OIE. Slack is consequently excluded from our reported revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Where appropriate, we will call out Slack-specific impact on our Q2 results and our guidance. 
As part of the acquisition, this quarter, we issued $8 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.25% and weighted average maturity of 20 years. We were very pleased by the terms we've received on what we view as an inexpensive source of capital.
In particular, I'd like to call attention to the strong reception of our $1 billion sustainability bond, which was our most oversubscribed note in the offering. And not only did we raise funds on favorable terms, but concurrent with our debt raise, S&P upgraded our credit rating to A+.
Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q2 fiscal '22, starting with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 21% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we've discussed the last few quarters enabled us to deliver these results as new business momentum continued to exceed our expectations.
A few key highlights. We saw acceleration in Sales Cloud with Q2 revenue of $1.5 billion or 15% year-over-year growth. Tableau and MuleSoft continued their momentum in enterprise deals as both saw their share of the company's top 10 deals increase. As Bret noted, Tableau was in 9 of the top 10 and MuleSoft in 8 of the top 10 deals this quarter. This is an incredible accomplishment and evidence of how strategic these acquisitions have become for our customers.
Public sector continues to be an area of strength, accounting for 4 of the top 10 deals this quarter. And again, this quarter, our 7-figure deals on average included more than 4.5 clouds. The number of 7-figure deals including 5 or more clouds grew by 29% year-over-year, showing continued momentum in our enterprise deals. And we continue to see strength in our international businesses, which accelerated sequentially, although we will note that EMEA and APAC growth benefited modestly from the integration of acquisitions into our billing practices.
We remain pleased with the progress on attrition with revenue attrition in Q2 between 8% and 8.5%, an improvement from last quarter's 9% to 9.5%. Attrition has continued to perform better than anticipated. As a reminder, our attrition rate is calculated based on trailing 12-month performance. And we have now lapped the second quarter of fiscal '21, which was impacted by the early days of the pandemic.
Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $36.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.7 billion, up 23%, both year-over-year and in constant currency.
Slack represents 4 points of growth, ahead of the 3 points we guided to last quarter due primarily to changes in our assumptions around purchase accounting.
Turning to operating margin. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. Salesforce recorded $45 million of transaction-related costs due to closing the Slack acquisition during the quarter. 
Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.48. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.42 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.43.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $386 million, down 10% year-over-year. On a cash basis, Salesforce paid $43 million of transaction fees related to the Slack acquisition.
CapEx for quarter was $213 million, leading to free cash flow of $173 million, down 45% year-over-year. And as a reminder, we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher to Q1 and Q4. Slack's operating results had no impact to Q2 operating cash flow or CapEx.
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue of $6.78 billion to $6.79 billion or approximately 25% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $250 million contribution from Slack. For Q3, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 22%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. We expect Q3 GAAP EPS of negative $0.06 to negative $0.05 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.92.
Now moving to fiscal '22 guidance updates. As a result of our year-to-date performance and strong execution in the current demand environment, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $300 million to $26.2 billion to $26.3 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $530 million from Slack in the second half of fiscal '22, an increase of $30 million over our previous guide. This guidance also includes $200 million from Acumen, an increase of $10 million from our previous guide. Net of the revised Slack and Acumen contributions, this represents a $260 million raise on our core business. Our ability to execute in the demand environment both remain strong.
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18.5%, representing an expansion of 80 basis points year-over-year. This now includes an expected 150 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen or 10 basis points less headwind compared to our previous guidance. Excluding this 10 basis point adjustment, our operating margin guidance represents a 40 basis point raise compared to our previous guidance.
We are also raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.81 to $0.83 and raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $4.36 to $4.38. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.51 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS.
Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01.
We are raising our fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points, now expecting 14% to 15% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and lower headwind from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 7 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 21% to 22%.
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%.
To close, we remain excited by the strength we see in the demand environment, and we're seeing record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw acceleration this quarter. We closed our largest deal in customer history. We had an impressive first half of fiscal '22, and we're excited to continue Slack's momentum with the power of our 2 companies now together. And the increased revenue guidance reflects the confidence we have in the fundamentals of our business, and we remain well on our way to achieving our goal of $50 billion in fiscal '26. We are committed to being disciplined along the way while challenging ourselves to find additional areas of operational improvement.
I want to say thank you to all of our employees for being able to focus on disciplined, efficient growth during the quarter. And we're looking forward to further strengthening the durability of our operating model going forward.
And finally, I look forward to engaging with many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 23. I'll now turn the call back to Marc for some final comments."

I couldn't be  more excited about the strength of our core business, our revenue growth, our margin growth, our cash flow growth as well as the addition of Slack now to our team of unicorns, if you will. I mean it's absolutely true, the best CRM just got better with Slack. And I -- if you listened to what Bret has to say about the integration of incredible things like Slack Connect, these are becoming extensions to our CRM capabilities. So it's a very exciting moment for our entire product line and our technology team. And I think that with that, our leadership team has really shown through this amazing perseverance and execution over the last several quarters these amazing results.
Now we're going to have our digital Dreamforce coming up in San Francisco in less than a month from September 21 through September 23. And we'll have tens of millions of customers from all over the world tuning in with us, and we'll have hundreds of customers with us live in San Francisco as well. So it's going to be extremely exciting. We want you all to have a front row seat. And please talk to Evan so you're all connected to this program. And we will also be redeploying our Dreamforce to You program as well, delivering custom Dreamforce capability for all of our customers. So I hope that you're all going to join us.
Okay. So as Amy mentioned, we're also looking forward to having you then at Investor Day. That will also be amazing, and we're expecting some awesome conversations with all of you.
So with that, I'll open it up to questions. So everybody is online right now, and we can take all your questions. So go ahead, Evan."

And actually, I think we've made a faster start integrating our technologies than any acquisition in our history. 
We did an event last week on this idea of a digital HQ where we announced Slack-First Sales, things like deal rooms inside of Slack Connect integrated with Sales Cloud. Slack-First Service, which are things like case swarming for digital customer service teams, Slack-First Marketing and Slack-First Analytics. So those capabilities are going to be in the hands of our customers soon, and we have a lot more innovation coming at Dreamforce as well. 
And with that, you asked what we're measuring, it's -- as you said, it's going to show up in things like multi-cloud deals that include Slack. It's also going to show up in a lot more departments and a lot more companies who are perhaps using these new digital collaboration technologies for the first time in the context of doing their job, in the context of customer service, in the context of sales, in the context of marketing and really realizing this vision of a digital HQ. 
I think Marc has talked a lot about how we're in this new pandemic world that this isn't going away. We've opened half of our offices. But as you can imagine, not as many people are showing up as we had hoped to at this point because of this pandemic. I've started 2 companies and I started by planning my office space. And now if you're starting a company, you start by planning your digital HQ. And that's really what we want to bring to every company in the world, help them build the digital infrastructure to help them succeed in this new normal. 
And one thing that I think we're really excited about that Marc also mentioned is Slack Connect, which is really bringing these digital tools outside of the walls of our customers' buildings and bringing them to partners and customers as well, and you've seen that in a lot of the product integrations we announced."

Since we announced the deal 6 months ago, 9 months ago, obviously, we've been having conversations with customers about what we're planning to do, recognizing this needing to go through the DOJ process. And I have to say I -- Randy came across a product that has the buzz, the excitement, the customer advocacy that Slack does. It really is quite remarkable. So there's, I think, huge interest out there amongst customers. Many of our customers are both Salesforce customers and now Slack customers. So there's good overlap between the 2, and they can see the synergy that we're going to have from a product perspective. 
We are beginning to sell through Slack. The most powerful presentation the sales teams give are often Salesforce-on-Salesforce. And so Slack-on-Slack is a very compelling way to explain how we use the product. And so we're beginning to do more and more of that. And where we are closing deals, we're leaning in to close deals through closing the deal itself on Slack, creating channels between us and the customer and ensuring that everybody who's working on the deal can have real-time access to those channels. And it means that the deals close much more quickly. So in fact, the Slack deal itself was closed on Slack. So that is the perfect example of Slack-on-Slack, I think. Amy?"

So Mark, turning to your other question about operating margin. So where we have really seen this growing this year? First, we are gaining the benefit of very strong business performance in Q1 and Q2, and that does allow us room to provide profitability. And that's while still investing in growth and absorbing the impacts of M&A. 
And second, we are continuing to build on what we learned during the pandemic about how we can work effectively in a digital-first or a hybrid environment. Some examples of that, virtual go-to-market motion, sales enablement, which is largely virtual at this point or digital, and also a renewed emphasis on financial automation, which I believe will pay off in the long run. 
And then finally, it's simply an approach of disciplined decision-making. And when we're seeing investment opportunities, we're taking a very hard look. We are challenging ourselves, and we're finding ways to shift our operating model where necessary."

Just an incredible combination. But I think it really shows just our philosophy on our M&A and why I think we've had really unprecedented success in the marketplace and integrating our acquisitions successfully. 
We really try to integrate our platform. And with Tableau, with MuleSoft, with Slack, this all amplifies our vision for our Customer 360. At the center of all these digital transformations our customers are going through is data. You need to integrate that data with MuleSoft. You need to see and understand it with Tableau. And you need to act on that. And that's all going to happen with Slack, which is the system of engagement for the Customer 360 but also the system of engagement for every application at your company. 
So I think it's an incredibly powerful combination. And I actually think Slack has the potential to really accelerate every single product in the Customer 360, Tableau included. And Tableau, especially -- really, I think it has potential across the board. And then it really goes to just this fundamental shift in the workplace we're all experiencing. All of you are probably working from home right now -- or most of you are. This digital HQ is at the center of every single one of the transformations we're bringing to our customers."

And as I look into the second half of the year, I see that continuing. The pipeline is really strong. The conversations we're having with customers are accelerating, if anything. And so we chose to make the decision 3 months ago because we could see this demand in the marketplace. We chose to increase our investment in our direct sales force to get better coverage with customers. And that is a sign of our confidence in the business. 
So I feel very confident that we can continue to grow top line while delivering on expectations around operating margin. It isn't a trade-off.

And the real focus is on time to value, which is good for us. We want as much -- we want our customers to be on standard products as much as possible. Configuring, yes. Customizing, not so much because there's so much innovation coming through and it's easier to do through staying on the standard path. 
So it's -- either in the U.S. or in Europe, we're seeing our business grow across the board, both in terms of small customers on one end, the SMB market, all the way up to multinationals. We're seeing increasingly bigger deals. And we highlighted our biggest ever deal in terms of recurring revenue in this quarter. It's a public sector deal.

And I think this echoes comments from both Marc and Amy. I don't recall seeing this type of raise to the full year guide in terms of top line revenues, definitely not the type of raise to the operating margin guide historically, especially in the first half of the year. Maybe Gavin or Marc, you could talk to what are you guys seeing in the pipeline that's giving you the confidence to increase guidance in the first half of the year for the second half of the year already.
And maybe to Amy, when we see this operating margin expansion, is this durable, if you will, on a go-forward basis? And in particular, should we be thinking about T&E expenses or some of the kind of reflation of that OpEx line that might be being pushed out because of Delta variant or sort of a slower reopening pace into future years? Or is this margin expansion going to be more durable?"

And so many of the CEO conversations that we're having -- and let me emphasize the ones I'm having in Europe. Number one, because of the Green New Deal that's happening here in Europe, every CEO here is focused on their n",783,"Yes. Let me take a swing at that. And so many of the CEO conversations that we're having -- and let me emphasize the ones I'm having in Europe. Number one, because of the Green New Deal that's happening here in Europe, every CEO here is focused on their net 0 transformation. And they realized that for them to continue to be successful in this environment, in this economy, they're having to make the net 0  transformation. And that's been very important to us. We've already made that transformation, and now we're fully renewable as well, as I mentioned.
The second thing is I think every CEO that I mentioned and talked to today and yesterday and probably in the conversations that I've had over the last several months are going through all types of supply chain challenges. I'm sure you're hearing that in your own checks with your clients, but that's been very surprising to me. And I would say that's the second CEO priority. 
And then I'd say the third CEO priority is exactly what we've been talking about here, which is success from anywhere in this new world. They realize their employees are not coming back exactly as they wanted. I have some stories about when we first started talking about success from anywhere, that employees would have a choice between office, home, maybe working in an environment like we had last week in Hawaii with our Laulima program or, as you know, we're building this new ranch. CEOs would call me and say, ""Marc, you don't understand. Everybody is coming back. Everything is going back the way it is."" And then it's over. And I think now those calls have stopped, and people realized things have really changed. This pandemic has changed things, and work has changed. 
And when we talk about digital HQ, we might have been talking about digital HQ before the pandemic. But after the pandemic, it means something very different. And I think that what Bret said kind of on the fly there, which was very powerful, that he's obviously has been an incredible entrepreneur as well as an operating executive of several companies. But if you were starting a new company, he's not planning his physical office place. He's planning his digital office space. And we're running this call now on a cell phone and on Zoom. And it's a very much an example of success from anywhere. 
But every company has to make this transformation. And that is what is driving our success going forward. This is not a small transformation. This is not a small change. This is why we would pay $27 billion for Slack. We believe so strongly that the world has changed, that the past is gone, that we are in a new world. And yes, we may -- I don't think the Delta variant will be material to our business. If anything, it only accelerates it. And Delta is not the last -- the last one of these things that we're going to see. We're seeing a constant now parade of these variants going by. We started with Alpha. And I don't know how many letters there are in the Greek alphabet, but Delta is not the last letter. So we know that. 
In fact, here in Europe, if you haven't read about what happened with Lambda 2 weeks ago, you probably should. But in all of those things, we're looking to life has to go on, and it is. And if you were here with me today, you say, well, there's probably some risk to what's going on. There probably is. But I'm vaccinated. Gavin's vaccinated. And we're running our business. And that is really the power, and that is the future of what's going on. And I think that this is what we all have to kind of get our head around. 
And I think in San Francisco, it's very different than how it is right here in Geneva, Switzerland, let me tell you. It's very, very different. I was in office buildings today. There's nobody in my office building right now. And also, people are not wearing masks in office buildings here. Everybody is supposed to wear a mask legally in San Francisco right now. So things are different. And this is what is amplifying us. So we're in a tremendous new world, and Salesforce has never been more positioned or well -- I would say Salesforce has never been better positioned for an economy and for a world. The first thing that I heard from Gavin was we're open for business, and this is where we're going. Do you want to add to that?"

We flattened the structure so that we can move in a more agile manner and give more accountability to operating unit leaders. 
And it's that focus on second and third order metrics around the sales operation. That means that I can have the confidence as I look forward into what we're going to deliver over the next not just 2 quarters, probably into next fiscal as well. I think it's a balanced pipe.

The pandemic led us kind of have a beginner's mind in regards to our entire business. And we made strategic decisions. We made tactical decisions, but we also made decisions at our core way that we're operating our business, and you can see that with these operating margin results.

I am actually here in Geneva, Switzerland with Gavin Patterson, our Chief Revenue Officer. And I'm attending the World Economic Forum's IBC meeting and Board of Trustees meeting, and it's been a great experience being here in Geneva. Very much the world is open for business here, and it's great to be meeting with our customers face-to-face and in person and discussing our business with them and talking about their businesses and how their businesses are doing in this new normal. And we're learning quite a bit about how different the U.S. is from Europe right now and also how much has really changed, which is quite a bit.
So I'm absolutely excited to be here, but I'm also extremely excited to share our phenomenal second quarter results with you. You can really see we had a phenomenal second quarter. We just had a phenomenal second half. You're about to hear we're about to have a phenomenal first half as well. And we're also going to have a good chat about what we're doing with Slack, a very exciting acquisition that's now closed. And you are going to hear about #1 CRM just got better. And it's incredible what's going on with Slack, and looking forward to addressing all that with the -- in the script with you.
So look, we are in a new world. There's no doubt about that. I'm sure that all of us realize that, and we are delivering success from anywhere as well for Salesforce. We've gone through a tremendous transformation, and we're now delivering this new world for our stakeholders. 
And from a business perspective, well, I'd say it's been an absolutely extraordinary 18 months for Salesforce, I know for all of you and certainly for all the CEOs I met with today. We're navigating this global pandemic. We have been guided by our core values of trust, of customer success, of innovation, of quality. But through all this and through our perseverance and through our, I think, dedication to our customers, we've been able to deliver record financial results. And with these results, we've now -- can say -- and looking over this, we've now had 5 outstanding quarters in a row really delivering the success from anywhere vision. Pretty awesome.
So let's take a look now at the second quarter because the numbers are incredible. And you can see we delivered our first $6 billion quarter, about $6.3 billion, and continue to maintain our very strong growth rate, our profitability, our cash flow, our margin growth, continue to execute our new operating margin model. And you can see right now, revenue and the growth in the quarter, you can see $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Pretty awesome and above where we thought we were going to be, considerably above.
And I guess I'm -- as excited as I am about the revenue, I'm also very excited that as we're executing this new operating margin model, we can see the margin in the quarter was also a very healthy 20.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and also delivered $386 million in operating cash flow.
For fiscal year '22, we are raising again our guide to $26.3 billion, which is now at the high end of our range. It's a raise of $300 million, and it's going to represent about 24% projected growth year-over-year and just really reflects, I think, how well the company is doing in its core, not just through the Slack acquisition, but you can see organically, especially when you look at the numbers over the last 5 quarters. And we're raising our operating margin to 18.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Again, based on just the outstanding performance of the company, we're able to do some amazing things here with the operating margin.
I don't think Salesforce has really ever been -- had better execution, better management team, greater momentum. And as I have spoken to so many customers today, I don't think we've ever been more well positioned for them. And I'll say that in 2 areas. One is in our core products, our focus on customer success, the Customer 360 now with the Slack user interface and everything being Slack first, but also our core values. 
So many of our customers are attracted to us because, in many cases, they're going through an amazing values transformation and in the areas of -- that we've pioneered. And now especially in regards to sustainability, which we'll talk about because, as you know, Salesforce has been a net 0 company, but now we're fully renewable as well. And as we start to head towards the Fortune 100, I think that -- a lot of the companies that I met with today were mostly Fortune 100 CEOs. They crave to have that same net 0 and renewable profile, which is very exciting to see the world having this kind of sustainability focus. 
So I'm absolutely thrilled to see how the core business grew in the first half of the year. And I am excited about the outlook. I'm excited about our positioning with our customers. And I'll tell you, I'm very excited that 5 out of the last 5 quarters that we've had that 20% or greater revenue growth. And 3 out of the last 5 quarters, we're having greater than 20% operating margin. I don't think we could have said either of those things 5 quarters ago. So my hat is really off to the management team and to the employees for making this happen. And we're raising our guidance for the fourth time in a row as we see increased opportunities for additional revenue growth and additional operating margin capability this year.
And look, we're the fastest-growing enterprise software company ever. You know that. You're tracking us. You see where the numbers are going. You can see what the trajectory is, the velocity of the company, both in revenue and margin. And now you can also see that no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level.
So we are really quite confident and remain on our path to generate $50 billion in revenue by fiscal year '26, which doesn't seem very far away from right now. And when we first gave that number, it didn't seem as -- it didn't -- it seems like it was so far away. Now it seems like, wow, this is going to happen."

This is Bret Taylor. I'm going to continue with the script. Thanks, Marc, for that amazing introduction and just a reflection on the momentum in the company right now.
It really was just an incredible quarter. Our products are more relevant than ever, and I have never seen this kind of momentum in the business. And honestly, that's because CRM is more strategic now than it's ever been. Every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And that's why around the world, more and more companies are putting their trust in Salesforce to help them get back to growth. That's the agenda on every CEO's mind in Switzerland, and it's on the mind of every Board around the world.
IDC just released our April 2021 SaaSPath Vendor Rating. It's a survey of more than 2,000 companies worldwide, and Salesforce has rated #1 in trust, #1 in product, #1 in industry specialization and #1 in value for the price. That is just amazing. It's a true measure of just how mission-critical we are to our customers. And you can just see it in the incredibly strong performance of all of our clouds this quarter.
Sales Cloud has been #1 in its category for more than a decade. And this year, we've reimagined the product to be the growth platform for digital sales teams. We are already seeing the results as Sales Cloud accelerated to 15% growth year-over-year.
Our Service Cloud is also seeing amazing momentum. All aspects of customer service has gone digital, from the contact center to field service to self-service and to bots. The scale of Service Cloud is just incredible. This is a $6 billion business whose growth has accelerated to 23% year-over-year.
Our Marketing and Commerce Cloud also grew 28% year-over-year as every organization in the world is investing in direct trusted relationship with our customers. And every one of these digital transformations is also a data transformation, which is driving the unprecedented success we're seeing in Tableau and MuleSoft. Tableau is in 9 of our top 10 deals this quarter, and MuleSoft was in 8 of our top 10 deals.
The real power of Salesforce platform is bringing all of these capabilities together into a Customer 360, a Single Source of Truth for your customers. Our industry strategy is enabling our customers to get started with an end-to-end Customer 360 faster than ever before, tailored to the specific needs of every industry.
Our Industry Cloud saw 58% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue. We had especially strong performance in the public sector, in our Health Cloud business and financial services. In fact, 4 of our top 10 deals in the second quarter came from the public sector.
Our core organic business has never been stronger, just like Marc said. And now with Slack, we're bringing a whole new dimension to Salesforce. There could not be a more relevant product at a more relevant time for every single one of our customers.
If you talk to any CEO, read the headline of any paper or even look around the home office most of you are sitting in right now, you can see the depth of the transformation work has gone through this year. Sales meetings have moved from conference rooms to Slack and to Zoom. Contact centers used to be buildings, and now they exist entirely in the cloud. My commute has moved from the highway to primarily my hallway. 
Slack is at the center of this. Slack is how organizations all around the world are finding success in this all-digital work anywhere world. It's your digital HQ. It connects your employees, your partners, your customers on a single platform and a platform that people love to use.
And the Slack-First Customer 360 makes every Salesforce product more powerful and more effective for our customers. Our engineering teams have really hit the ground running on this integration. Just last week, we announced our Slack-First sales, service, marketing and analytics at our launch event. And we've got a ton of Slack innovation coming at Dreamforce.
IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack-First Customer 360 company. Arvind Krishna is a close friend of mine. And in talking to him, he talked about how he believes that bringing Salesforce and Slack together is key for IBM to become even more connected, even more productive and more innovative. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530,000 customers, 380,000 employees and 50,000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud, across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere. 
Slack comes up in every single one of my customer conversations, and I could not be more thrilled with the momentum in the business. Slack's revenue accelerated to 39% growth year-over-year on a stand-alone basis. And they have great customer wins at Target, Lowe's, Conde Nast, UNICEF, Norton Healthcare. 
Now what's really fun about this is looking at the growth of Slack Connect. We've talked a lot about this. Slack Connect is the capability to enable you to connect not just with your fellow employees but to connect with your partners, with your vendors and your customers. Slack Connect grew 200% year-over-year. This really illustrates the power of not just Slack for employee engagement but the Slack-First Customer 360. Slack is a once-in-a-generation company that is transforming the way we work, and it's transforming the vision we have for our company over the next decade.
I am so grateful to be able to work with Stewart and the Slack team every day, and I'm really excited to bring this vision of the Slack-First Customer 360 to all of our customers. 
And if the technology Gods will allow, I'd love to transfer it over to Gavin to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. Gavin, are you on?"

Well, thanks, Bret.
[Audio Gap]
momentum we're seeing in the business. And you can see that really reflected in some of the remarkable customer wins we saw not just in the U.S. but around the world in the last quarter.
But starting in the U.S., we saw our largest-ever deal based on new annual recurring revenue, which is in the public sector. And as Bret said, public sector has been fantastic for us in the second quarter. Other examples, we expanded relationships with great companies like PayPal and Coinbase. While in EMEA, we have significant wins behind with Belron, who own things like Safelite and Autoglass, Freshfields, Dyson, Vodafone and a cracking business, Canyon Bicycles, which is a really great case study. And then in APAC, we continue to deepen our relationships with many businesses, including things like Afterpay and FWD Thailand. So we're seeing strength internationally as well as in the U.S.
Now a couple of examples I want to go into a little bit more detail on. One is a win with MillerKnoll. You might remember them more as Herman Miller, but it's a fantastic example, a company pivoting with great digital customer experience. So back at the start of the pandemic, MillerKnoll saw a huge spike in demand for their furniture, not surprisingly. Of course, they turned to Salesforce to transform their e-commerce experience in the quarter and are already seeing a significant improvement in conversion rates on the back of that. Since then, they've been providing an even better experience, tailored product recommendations, a streamlined checkout experience and next-generation video chat. 
And on top of that, MillerKnoll is a net 0 company. And they're now using Salesforce Sustainability Cloud to track their carbon footprint and other climate-related initiatives. So you can see it's a great example of how we're building partnerships, building multi-cloud solutions around the Customer 360, and we go from strength to strength.
I wanted to talk about RBC Wealth Management, which is another great win in the quarter. They're using the Customer 360 to streamline processes, integrate data from over 26 different systems to create a unified wealth management platform that provides advisers with a 360-degree view of every client. And I think that's something that really brings the Customer 360 to life for more than 2,100 RBC financial advisers. 
I think this example, to me, I think, is very powerful. They've been using Salesforce workflow automation to transform the client onboarding process, which was several weeks, more than 100 pages of physical documents, and it is now a digital task that takes just 24 minutes. And that is quite remarkable, I think.
GEICO was a great win in the quarter. Needs no introduction, of course. But in case you don't know about GEICO, it is the second largest auto insurer in the U.S. And they're really leaning into the power of the 360, the Customer 360, to create a single view of their customers across the heart -- entire business and with now more than 25,000 agents, are going to be putting their trust in that Customer 360, which is now providing AI-powered analytics to improve those customer relationships.
And 3M. Now this is one we've talked about in the past. You've heard Marc talk about how they've been using the Customer 360 across 83 countries. But that relationship continues to expand. Now 3M is using Trailhead to train thousands of customer-facing employees as they join the company. Salesforce Maps is now being used as part of their proposition. Tableau CRM is giving actual intelligence to better manage operations, engage with customers, boost productivity.
And then in Q2, 3M selected our Philanthropy Cloud to help empower nearly 100,000 employees to give back to their communities with the goal of achieving 2 million employee volunteer hours over the next 5 years. I think that's a really, really powerful example.
And then one more just before I hand over to Amy, and it's IKEA. So IKEA, fantastic business over here in Europe, another great example of the Customer 360. We've already been helping them with marketing. They've been getting great ROI with Market Cloud across over 30 markets. Now as home improvements were soaring in the pandemic, they turned to us to use Field Service to help schedule in-home planning business, installations, after-service support across the U.S. So another example of how we're building our relationships, adding clouds to existing customers, going increasingly into partnership-type relationships.
So I think these are a few examples. There are many more, but they are all, I think, examples of how we're helping customers deliver success from wherever they are, from anywhere.
So net-net, my conversations with customers, I think, have given me great confidence not just in the demand for our products and services but I think in our ability to execute in the second half of the year. So it's both demand and execution. So I continue to see this being maintained going forward. There's a really strong demand environment across Salesforce in the second half. And I think Slack is really going to enhance that.
So just before I hand over to Amy, I'd just like to say a quick thank you to the amazing effort of the sales teams around the world. They've been able to adapt to a different way of working, a new normal. And in doing so, we've been able to continue to support our customers. And I'd like to thank them for that. 
So Amy, over to you."
122917,1675928842,2390205,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2021",2021-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of remarkable top and bottom line performance. We exceeded our top line expectations, achieving record levels of Q2 new business. We saw strong demand across all of our products",1493,"Great. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of remarkable top and bottom line performance. We exceeded our top line expectations, achieving record levels of Q2 new business. We saw strong demand across all of our products, regions and customer sizes. And we were able to execute with discipline to drive higher operating income.
We also completed the acquisition of Slack Technologies on July 21, bringing yet another best-in-class asset into our Customer 360. We believe that Slack will play a critical role in the digital transformation of our customers as they reimagine the future of work in a digital-first work-from-anywhere environment. And that process is already underway with Slack's business accelerating into the close of the acquisition.
In Q2, Slack's revenue grew 39% year-over-year on a stand-alone basis, which excludes any impact of purchase accounting. Slack also saw strong performance in customer acquisition, especially in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated during the quarter, up 41%.
For the short period between the close of the deal and the end of our fiscal Q2, Slack's operating results were immaterial to our non-GAAP results, and they are included below the line in OIE. Slack is consequently excluded from our reported revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Where appropriate, we will call out Slack-specific impact on our Q2 results and our guidance. 
As part of the acquisition, this quarter, we issued $8 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.25% and weighted average maturity of 20 years. We were very pleased by the terms we've received on what we view as an inexpensive source of capital.
In particular, I'd like to call attention to the strong reception of our $1 billion sustainability bond, which was our most oversubscribed note in the offering. And not only did we raise funds on favorable terms, but concurrent with our debt raise, S&P upgraded our credit rating to A+.
Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q2 fiscal '22, starting with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $6.34 billion, up 23% year-over-year or 21% in constant currency. The strong new business pipeline that we've discussed the last few quarters enabled us to deliver these results as new business momentum continued to exceed our expectations.
A few key highlights. We saw acceleration in Sales Cloud with Q2 revenue of $1.5 billion or 15% year-over-year growth. Tableau and MuleSoft continued their momentum in enterprise deals as both saw their share of the company's top 10 deals increase. As Bret noted, Tableau was in 9 of the top 10 and MuleSoft in 8 of the top 10 deals this quarter. This is an incredible accomplishment and evidence of how strategic these acquisitions have become for our customers.
Public sector continues to be an area of strength, accounting for 4 of the top 10 deals this quarter. And again, this quarter, our 7-figure deals on average included more than 4.5 clouds. The number of 7-figure deals including 5 or more clouds grew by 29% year-over-year, showing continued momentum in our enterprise deals. And we continue to see strength in our international businesses, which accelerated sequentially, although we will note that EMEA and APAC growth benefited modestly from the integration of acquisitions into our billing practices.
We remain pleased with the progress on attrition with revenue attrition in Q2 between 8% and 8.5%, an improvement from last quarter's 9% to 9.5%. Attrition has continued to perform better than anticipated. As a reminder, our attrition rate is calculated based on trailing 12-month performance. And we have now lapped the second quarter of fiscal '21, which was impacted by the early days of the pandemic.
Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $36.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.7 billion, up 23%, both year-over-year and in constant currency.
Slack represents 4 points of growth, ahead of the 3 points we guided to last quarter due primarily to changes in our assumptions around purchase accounting.
Turning to operating margin. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. Salesforce recorded $45 million of transaction-related costs due to closing the Slack acquisition during the quarter. 
Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.48. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to higher revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.42 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.43.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $386 million, down 10% year-over-year. On a cash basis, Salesforce paid $43 million of transaction fees related to the Slack acquisition.
CapEx for quarter was $213 million, leading to free cash flow of $173 million, down 45% year-over-year. And as a reminder, we continue to expect cash flow seasonality to skew higher to Q1 and Q4. Slack's operating results had no impact to Q2 operating cash flow or CapEx.
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue of $6.78 billion to $6.79 billion or approximately 25% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $250 million contribution from Slack. For Q3, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 22%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. We expect Q3 GAAP EPS of negative $0.06 to negative $0.05 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.92.
Now moving to fiscal '22 guidance updates. As a result of our year-to-date performance and strong execution in the current demand environment, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by $300 million to $26.2 billion to $26.3 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance incorporates an expected revenue contribution of $530 million from Slack in the second half of fiscal '22, an increase of $30 million over our previous guide. This guidance also includes $200 million from Acumen, an increase of $10 million from our previous guide. Net of the revised Slack and Acumen contributions, this represents a $260 million raise on our core business. Our ability to execute in the demand environment both remain strong.
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin to 18.5%, representing an expansion of 80 basis points year-over-year. This now includes an expected 150 basis points headwind from Slack and Acumen or 10 basis points less headwind compared to our previous guidance. Excluding this 10 basis point adjustment, our operating margin guidance represents a 40 basis point raise compared to our previous guidance.
We are also raising fiscal '22 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.81 to $0.83 and raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $4.36 to $4.38. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.51 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS.
Please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01.
We are raising our fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 2 points, now expecting 14% to 15% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by revenue performance and lower headwind from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 7 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 21% to 22%.
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 22% to 23%.
To close, we remain excited by the strength we see in the demand environment, and we're seeing record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw acceleration this quarter. We closed our largest deal in customer history. We had an impressive first half of fiscal '22, and we're excited to continue Slack's momentum with the power of our 2 companies now together. And the increased revenue guidance reflects the confidence we have in the fundamentals of our business, and we remain well on our way to achieving our goal of $50 billion in fiscal '26. We are committed to being disciplined along the way while challenging ourselves to find additional areas of operational improvement.
I want to say thank you to all of our employees for being able to focus on disciplined, efficient growth during the quarter. And we're looking forward to further strengthening the durability of our operating model going forward.
And finally, I look forward to engaging with many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 23. I'll now turn the call back to Marc for some final comments."

I couldn't be more excited about the strength of our core business, our revenue growth, our margin growth, our cash flow growth as well as the addition of Slack now to our team of unicorns, if you will. I mean it's absolutely true, the best CRM just got better with Slack. And I -- if you listened to what Bret has to say about the integration of incredible things like Slack Connect, these are becoming extensions to our CRM capabilities. So it's a very exciting moment for our entire product line and our technology team. And I think that with that, our leadership team has really shown through this amazing perseverance and execution over the last several quarters these amazing results.
Now we're going to have our digital Dreamforce coming up in San Francisco in less than a month from September 21 through September 23. And we'll have tens of millions of customers from all over the world tuning in with us, and we'll have hundreds of customers with us live in San Francisco as well. So it's going to be extremely exciting. We want you all to have a front row seat. And please talk to Evan so you're all connected to this program. And we will also be redeploying our Dreamforce to You program as well, delivering custom Dreamforce capability for all of our customers. So I hope that you're all going to join us.
Okay. So as Amy mentioned, we're also looking forward to having you then at Investor Day. That will also be amazing, and we're expecting some awesome conversations with all of you.
So with that, I'll open it up to questions. So everybody is online right now, and we can take all your questions. So go ahead, Evan."

And actually, I think we've made a faster start integrating our technologies than any acquisition in our history. 
We did an event last week on this idea of a digital HQ where we announced Slack-First Sales, things like deal rooms inside of Slack Connect integrated with Sales Cloud. Slack-First Service, which are things like case swarming for digital customer service teams, Slack-First Marketing and Slack-First Analytics. So those capabilities are going to be in the hands of our customers soon, and we have a lot more innovation coming at Dreamforce as well. 
And with that, you asked what we're measuring, it's -- as you said, it's going to show up in things like multi-cloud deals that include Slack. It's also going to show up in a lot more departments and a lot more companies who are perhaps using these new digital collaboration technologies for the first time in the context of doing their job, in the context of customer service, in the context of sales, in the context of marketing and really realizing this vision of a digital HQ. 
I think Marc has talked a lot about how we're in this new pandemic world that this isn't going away. We've opened half of our offices. But as you can imagine, not as many people are showing up as we had hoped to at this point because of this pandemic. I've started 2 companies and I started by planning my office space. And now if you're starting a company, you start by planning your digital HQ. And that's really what we want to bring to every company in the world, help them build the digital infrastructure to help them succeed in this new normal. 
And one thing that I think we're really excited about that Marc also mentioned is Slack Connect, which is really bringing these digital tools outside of the walls of our customers' buildings and bringing them to partners and customers as well, and you've seen that in a lot of the product integrations we announced."

Since we announced the deal 6 months ago, 9 months ago, obviously, we've been having conversations with customers about what we're planning to do, recognizing this needing to go through the DOJ process. And I have to say I -- Randy came across a product that has the buzz, the excitement, the customer advocacy that Slack does. It really is quite remarkable. So there's, I think, huge interest out there amongst customers. Many of our customers are both Salesforce customers and now Slack customers. So there's good overlap between the 2, and they can see the synergy that we're going to have from a product perspective. 
We are beginning to sell through Slack. The most powerful presentation the sales teams give are often Salesforce-on-Salesforce. And so Slack-on-Slack is a very compelling way to explain how we use the product. And so we're beginning to do more and more of that. And where we are closing deals, we're leaning in to close deals through closing the deal itself on Slack, creating channels between us and the customer and ensuring that everybody who's working on the deal can have real-time access to those channels. And it means that the deals close much more quickly. So in fact, the Slack deal itself was closed on Slack. So that is the perfect example of Slack-on-Slack, I think. Amy?"

So Mark, turning to your other question about operating margin. So where we have really seen this growing this year? First, we are gaining the benefit of very strong business performance in Q1 and Q2, and that does allow us room to provide profitability. And that's while still investing in growth and absorbing the impacts of M&A. 
And second, we are continuing to build on what we learned during the pandemic about how we can work effectively in a digital-first or a hybrid environment. Some examples of that, virtual go-to-market motion, sales enablement, which is largely virtual at this point or digital, and also a renewed emphasis on financial automation, which I believe will pay off in the long run. 
And then finally, it's simply an approach of disciplined decision-making. And when we're seeing investment opportunities, we're taking a very hard look. We are challenging ourselves, and we're finding ways to shift our operating model where necessary."

We're really excited about the combination of Slack and Tableau. And it sounds like you watched the event. But for other folks on the call who didn't we showed, I think, a really wonderful integration between Tableau and Slack. So your data can talk to you. Automated notifications so that when you need to take action on data, you're getting notified in Slack. You can collaborate with your colleagues to diagnose a business issue. Just an incredible combination. But I think it really shows just our philosophy on our M&A and why I think we've had really unprecedented success in the marketplace and integrating our acquisitions successfully. 
We really try to integrate our platform. And with Tableau, with MuleSoft, with Slack, this all amplifies our vision for our Customer 360. At the center of all these digital transformations our customers are going through is data. You need to integrate that data with MuleSoft. You need to see and understand it with Tableau. And you need to act on that. And that's all going to happen with Slack, which is the system of engagement for the Customer 360 but also the system of engagement for every application at your company. 
So I think it's an incredibly powerful combination. And I actually think Slack has the potential to really accelerate every single product in the Customer 360, Tableau included. And Tableau, especially -- really, I think it has potential across the board. And then it really goes to just this fundamental shift in the workplace we're all experiencing. All of you are probably working from home right now -- or most of you are. This digital HQ is at the center of every single one of the transformations we're bringing to our customers."

On operating margin, like I said, I think we have to be able to drive growth and increasing profitability at the same time. As I mentioned, we've been doing that this year through terrific business performance, through efficiencies, through the work-from-anywhere and as well as through discipline. 
And Marc talked about the new operating model. I actually like to think of it more as a new operating mindset. And it's a real focus on discipline and looking at what is going to make us a company that not just only gets us to $50 billion, that makes us a strong, durable company when we get there and positions us to sales through that. So these are multiple changes around the company, but I've been really gratified to see everyone jumping in. This has been really an effort from the entire executive leadership team."

So we've just come off our half year review in Laulima in Hawaii, where we've got our top 100 executives together in person and reviewed the last 6 months and looked ahead into the future. And I was really happy that I was able to share 2 fantastic quarters to start the year and really strong demand and really strong execution. 
And as I look into the second half of the year, I see that continuing. The pipeline is really strong. The conversations we're having with customers are accelerating, if anything. And so we chose to make the decision 3 months ago because we could see this demand in the marketplace. We chose to increase our investment in our direct sales force to get better coverage with customers. And that is a sign of our confidence in the business. 
So I feel very confident that we can continue to grow top line while delivering on expectations around operating margin. It isn't a trade-off. I think there's a balance that we can get between the 2, making sure we seize the opportunities in the marketplace. We're able to serve that demand we can see from customers, those multi-cloud deals that I was talking about earlier, while at the same time, ensuring that we benefit from -- benefit from scale, and we see that in the operating margin."

So digital customer transformation is no longer something that is delegated down the organization. It's a conversation that's going on in the boardroom. It's a CEO priority. And that means we're getting, I think, bigger deals, more multi-trial deals, multiyear deals. And it's increasingly a conversation about the Customer 360. 
And the real focus is on time to value, which is good for us. We want as much -- we want our customers to be on standard products as much as possible. Configuring, yes. Customizing, not so much because there's so much innovation coming through and it's easier to do through staying on the standard path. 
So it's -- either in the U.S. or in Europe, we're seeing our business grow across the board, both in terms of small customers on one end, the SMB market, all the way up to multinationals. We're seeing increasingly bigger deals. And we highlighted our biggest ever deal in terms of recurring revenue in this quarter. It's a public sector deal. But we're seeing more and more not just $1 million-plus deals but $10 million deals coming through the business. And I think that's a sign of, I think, the increasing importance of the Salesforce offer and what it means to businesses."

Maybe Gavin or Marc, you could talk to what are you guys seeing in the pipeline that's giving you the confidence to increase guidance in the first half of the year for the second half of the year already.
And maybe to Amy, when we see this operating margin expansion, is this durable, if you will, on a go-forward basis? And in particular, should we be thinking about T&E expenses or some of the kind of reflation of that OpEx line that might be being pushed out because of Delta variant or sort of a slower reopening pace into future years? Or is this margin expansion going to be more durable?"
122917,1675928842,2390205,"salesforce.com, inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2021",2021-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Let me take a swing at that.

And so many of the CEO conversations that we're having -- and let me emphasize the ones I'm having in Europe. Number one, because of the Green New Deal that's happening here in Europe, every CEO here is focused on their net 0 transformation. And they realized that for them to continue to be successful in this environment, in this economy, they're having to make the net 0  transformation. And that's been very important to us. We've already made that transformation, and now we're fully renewable as well, as I mentioned.
The second thing is I think every CEO that I mentioned and talked to today and yesterday and probably in the conversations that I've had over the last several months are going through all types of supply chain challenges. I'm sure you're hearing that in your own checks with your clients, but that's been very surprising to me. And I would say that's the second CEO priority. 
And then I'd say the third CEO priority is exactly what we've been talking about here, which is success from anywhere in this new world. They realize their employees are not coming back exactly as they wanted. I have some stories about when we first started talking about success from anywhere, that employees would have a choice between office, home, maybe working in an environment like we had last week in Hawaii with our Laulima program or, as you know, we're building this new ranch. CEOs would call me and say, ""Marc, you don't understand. Everybody is coming back. Everything is going back the way it is."" And then it's over. And I think now those calls have stopped, and people realized things have really changed. This pandemic has changed things, and work has changed. 
And when we talk about digital HQ, we might have been talking about digital HQ before the pandemic. But after the pandemic, it means something very different. And I think that what Bret said kind of on the fly there, which was very powerful, that he's obviously has been an incredible entrepreneur as well as an operating executive of several companies. But if he was starting a new company, he's not planning his physical office space. He's planning his digital office space. And we're running this call now on a cell phone and on Zoom. And it's a very much an example of success from anywhere. 
But every company has to make this transformation. And that is what is driving our success going forward. This is not a small transformation. This is not a small change. This is why we would pay $27 billion for Slack. We believe so strongly that the world has changed, that the past is gone, that we are in a new world. And yes, we may -- I don't think the Delta variant will be material to our business. If anything, it only accelerates it. And Delta is not the last -- the last one of these things that we're going to see. We're seeing a constant now parade of these variants going by. We started with Alpha. And I don't know how many letters there are in the Greek alphabet, but Delta is not the last letter. So we know that. 
In fact, here in Europe, if you haven't read about what happened with Lambda 2 weeks ago, you probably should. But in all of those things, we're looking to life has to go on, and it is. And if you were here with me today, you say, well, there's probably some risk to what's going on. There probably is. But I'm vaccinated. Gavin's vaccinated. And we're running our business. And that is really the power, and that is the future of what's going on. And I think that this is what we all have to kind of get our head around. 
And I think in San Francisco, it's very different than how it is right here in Geneva, Switzerland, let me tell you. It's very, very different. I was in office buildings today. There's nobody in my office building right now. And also, people are not wearing masks in office buildings here. Everybody is supposed to wear a mask legally in San Francisco right now. So things are different. And this is what is amplifying us. So we're in a tremendous new world, and Salesforce has never been more positioned or well -- I would say Salesforce has never been better positioned for an economy and for a world. The first thing that I heard from Gavin was we're open for business, and this is where we're going. Do you want to add to that?"

We flattened the structure so that we can move in a more agile manner and give more accountability to operating unit leaders.

And we -- I would say this is -- things are still changing and transforming. We're almost in a pandemic age, and we're kind of getting used to what it means to be inside of a pandemic. And yet at the same time, Salesforce has never been more successful. 
And I think Bret, when you look at the financial results, I'm sure you'd agree, this was an amazing third quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $6.86 billion, up 27% year-over-year. It's really driven by all these amazing products, but really by this incredible customer success. And we can see it where we're #1 again for the eighth year in a row in CRM according to IDC. It's really exciting. Were you surprised to see that?"

And our sales and service clouds, well, they've become massive individual businesses at this point and generating more than $6 billion each. I mean that's bigger than a lot of cloud companies that I know by themselves. And they're continuing to grow in the double digits. It's amazing. I mean Sales Cloud is amazing this quarter. 
And operating in the (sic) margin in the quarter was also very good at 19.8%, and that exceeded my expectations. and we delivered $404 million in operating cash flow, up 19% year-over-year. 
And now for fiscal year '22, we're raising our revenue guide again. Just raised it at Investor Day a couple of weeks ago and now we're raising it again to $26.4 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 24% projected growth year-over-year. That's a $100 million raise since Q2 when we initiated guidance for revenue in December of last year. We've now raised guidance, since that initial -- initiation, $850 million, pretty awesome. 
And we're delighted to raise our full year operating margin once again to 18.6%. We have obviously a new team. We have a new structure now. We're in a new world. We're talking about that. But we have an incredible new model, and it's really reflected in this incredible operating margin performance really for this year and also the operating margin guide for next year as well. And this is really an incredible reflection of this new way that we have the new way we're thinking and how we're driving [ a new ] Salesforce. And as we shared at our Investor Day in September, we're expecting fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $31.8 billion, that's the high end of our range, and operating margin of 20%. 
Now as everyone knows, no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level, we know that because we're talking to other cloud CEOs every day. And I'll tell you, I couldn't be more proud of our Ohana and that Salesforce is soon going to enter the Fortune 100. We -- really if you think about it, we only spent 2 years to the $20 billion. To think about how long I was waiting to get into the $20 billion in revenue for Salesforce, and we're done with it. It's kind of like now we're talking about being in the $30 billion. And I am, I wonder, wow, this is amazing. How long are we going to end up in the $30 billion? So you got to enjoy every moment because it goes fast. 
And you look at the growth, and I really think it's all about this customer success. It's been awesome. I know we're going to tell some great stories here on the call, LVMH and VMware and ADT and so many of our customers. And we're hearing some great stories from Slack customers too. I'm looking forward to Bret telling you a couple of great stories. 
I've had a great story yesterday from a friend of mine who was at a check-in counter for an airline. And they were using Slack entirely to make the reservation and book the tickets. It's an incredible story with this company. So well, I guess all of this is just an overnight success story for Salesforce doing it now almost a quarter of a century, and it's been a great quarter. 
All right. Well, Bret, congratulations. And why don't you take it from here?"

I also want to talk about Slack. So Slack outperformed our expectations in their first full quarter as a part of the Salesforce family. The number of customers on Slack who spent over $100,000 was up 44% year-over-year. And adoption of Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year. Slack is not just a product, Slack is a network, and it's just incredible to see that growth. 
Slack also continues to innovate at an unbelievable pace. Slack Huddle, which is Slack's new real-time audio capability, is already used weekly by over 1/3 of Slack users. And Slack Clips, the new asynchronous video capability, are being played nearly 1 million times a week. And this month at Slack Frontiers, which I hope all of you have watched; and if you haven't, you can watch it online.

You can see in the results of the third quarter for Slack. Slack hit $280 million of revenue, $30 million ahead of guidance. Retailers like Saks and innovative companies like the Southeast Asian ridesharing and food delivery app, Grab, they're relying on Slack every day to collaborate to automate workflows and to connect with their partners. 
And what's exciting to me, Marc, is the deep product innovations we're building between Slack and Customer 360 while already driving success for our customers. I had a great time working with VMware's new CEO, Raghu Raghuram, this quarter. And he's spun VMware out of Dell. And Raghu's team is already using Slack and Service Cloud for case [indiscernible] and decreased the time to resolution for their customers. I could not be more excited for the momentum we see in the Slack business and in particular, Slack's integration in the Salesforce.

And the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together is creating the digital HQ that is enabling our customers to get back to growth. And as Bret said, Salesforce has never been more relevant. 
In the quarter, we saw strong growth in every region, especially in the Americas. We grew relationships with Amazon, Builders FirstSource, IQVIA, Sunbelt Rentals, Tapestry and so many more. In EMEA, we deepened relationships with incredible brands like Fennia, Primark and Puma. And in APAC, we had significant wins with Foxtel, Fujitsu, Hitachi and the New Zealand Ministry of Health. 
Now we all know the incredible security company, ADT. They're using Salesforce Customer 360 to unify their entire customer experience, empowering 4,000 customer service agents and 7,000 field service agents with a complete view of their customers, which is driving operational efficiencies as well as growth. 
And as Bret said, we expanded our partnership with VMware, which has been a Salesforce customer since 2008. This quarter, they kicked off a pilot of Slack plus Service Cloud to accelerate customer support. They also partnered with Tableau to extend data and analytics across their entire business, enabling the presentation of deep analytics to help innovate even faster. 
LVMH continues to expand with Salesforce to deliver luxury goods from anywhere. Globally, 40,000 retail associates and customer service agents use Salesforce to deliver personalized retail journeys for their customers. 
And our win with the Boohoo Group, which is a leading U.K.-based online shopping experience with Commerce Cloud, Boohoo is now expanding shopping by social media marketplaces as they look to build for the future. 
And the State of Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles is another great story in the quarter. They selected Salesforce as the platform to power its digital transformation across its entire business. This will mean a whole new experience for residents renewing drivers licenses, credentialing, titling and registering vehicles and so much more. And this is another great example of digital transformation powered by Salesforce, of course, another great reason to move to Las Vegas. 
These are all great organizations that have pivoted their business to navigate this new world and deliver customer success from anywhere. They're relying on us more than ever and inspiring us to leverage the power of our Salesforce Customer 360, Slack and so much more to continue to fuel that business. 
And finally, a word on Q4. I'm really encouraged about how we started the quarter. Demand and pipe looks strong, and we're looking forward to a great finish to what has been an exceptional year. 
I want to thank our incredible team for continuing to do such a great job in the massive global change. The work they do and the technology they deliver powers our customers' success, and we couldn't be more grateful. Amy, over to you to share the financial details of our quarter."

We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and ca",1549,"Great. Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. 
As we discussed 2 months ago at our Analyst Day, we are in a new world. And we showed our ability to execute on this new world once again in Q3. We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and cash flows. And our focus remains on disciplined and profitable growth. 
Q3 was also a milestone quarter as it was our first full quarter with Slack. Building on their strong performance over the last several quarters, Slack's early results reinforce our confidence in the strategic importance of this best-in-class asset. 
Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q3 fiscal '22 beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $6.86 billion, which includes $280 million from Slack. This is up 27% year-over-year, or 26% in constant currency. The strong demand environment and new business pipeline that we've highlighted on the last few earnings calls continued, allowing us to outperform top line expectations again. A few key highlights from the quarter: 
First launched 22 years ago, Sales Cloud became a $6 billion run rate business this quarter and grew revenue 17%. Sales Cloud now joins Service Cloud, which became a $6 billion business just 2 quarters ago. And Service Cloud continues to grow over 20% at scale. These are 2 massive businesses growing in the double digits, and their success is a testament to the strength of our core. 
Our Americas business is performing extremely well, and we see a healthy demand environment in front of us. New business in North America was especially strong, our largest market that we've been operating in for over 20 years. And as you heard from Bret, [ we have to] continue to outperform our expectations. 
Slack has strong customer acquisition with notable strength in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 44% year-over-year. 
Slack Connect option remains strong, with the number of connected end points reaching a record level of 176% year-over-year. And we've been able to introduce new customers. Already, 4 of our top 10 deals this quarter included a new Slack win. 
Once again, we saw strong growth in our multi-cloud deals as our customers continue to ask for more than point solutions. In Q3, we recorded 33% year-over-year growth in the number of deals containing 5 or more clouds. 
We did see some headwinds this quarter to our MuleSoft business. When a business is growing as quickly as MuleSoft is, there are scaling challenges you can face, and we experienced some of these challenges this quarter. We are confident in the changes that we have made going forward. 
As a reminder, a large portion of our MuleSoft revenue is recognized in period, which has an outsized impact to our second half revenue. MuleSoft remains a critical part our Customer 360, allowing our customers to integrate all of their data and systems. 
Beginning this quarter with the incorporation of Slack into our financial results, we are providing investors with updated revenue by service offering disclosures. Going forward, Slack will be reported in platform and others. We are also creating a new revenue category, data, which will incorporate MuleSoft and Tableau including Tableau CRM, all of which were previously included in platform and others. We believe this will provide greater transparency into our results. A historical reclass using our new revenue breakdown is available in the earnings deck that we have published along aside our press release. 
And we continue to make great progress on attrition. For the first time in company history, revenue attrition was below 8%. Q3 attrition was between 7.5% to 8%, an improvement versus last quarter's 8% to 8.5%. 
Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at approximately $36.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in constant currency. Slack represents 4 points of growth, in line with our guidance.
Turning to operating margin. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, which continues to benefit from revenue outperformance, efficiency from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. 
Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.27. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to stronger revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.27 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.28.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $404 million, up 19% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $166 million, resulting in free cash flow of $238 million, up 11% year-over-year.
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q4 revenue of $7.224 billion to $7.234 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $285 million contribution from Slack in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by another $50 million to $26.3 billion to $26.4 billion. This equates to a total $100 million raise to our revenue guidance since Q2. 
Our guidance now includes $565 million contribution from Slack for the fiscal year. The fiscal year revenue contribution from Slack represents a $35 million increase from our previous guidance. Our full year guidance continues to include $200 million from Acumen. 
For Q4, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. 
One thing I will call attention to is that we remain mindful of the strengthening U.S. dollar in our foreign operations, which may impact our financials. We continue to monitor foreign exchange as we execute on what is typically the largest quarter in our fiscal year. 
We expect Q4 GAAP EPS of negative $0.24 to negative $0.23, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 to $0.73. For the full year, this translates to GAAP EPS guidance of $1.28 to $1.29, and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.68 to $4.69. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.49 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further contribution from loss to market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.6%, representing an expansion of 90 basis points year-over-year. The raise in our operating margin guidance is due to refined assumptions around Slack and Acumen. We now expect a 140 basis point headwind, or 10 basis points less headwind than our previous guidance. 
I'd like to call out that our guidance continues to incorporate expense seasonality that is weighted to Q4, including investments in both our workforce and growth opportunities and P&E expectations. 
We are raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 4 points, now expecting 18% to 19% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide was primarily driven by strong revenue performance and lower headwinds from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 5 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 23% to 24%. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, thus resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 19% to 20% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A as previously noted, this rate would be 25% to 26%. 
As I shared with you 2 months ago, it is incredibly important to drive this conscious decision-making in every aspect of the company. This new mindset will enable a more durable company as we approach $50 billion, and fiscal '22 represents how we can deliver profitable growth in this new world.
Turning to fiscal '23, we are pleased -- we were pleased to provide our initial revenue and non-GAAP operating margin guidance during our Investor Day. Today we are initiating Q1 fiscal '23 revenue guidance of $7.215 billion to $7.25 billion, or approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. As Gavin mentioned, we're off to a strong start in Q4, and we'll provide you with our complete fiscal '23 guidance as part of our Q4 earnings in February. 
So to close, our business is performing well, and we continue to see record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw its third consecutive quarter of acceleration. And we now have two $6 billion businesses in sales and service. 
Slack is outperforming our expectations, and the integration continues to progress well. And we remain incredibly well positioned with our broad product portfolio and global reach to be able to serve all of our customers. Our products are more relevant than ever.
Finally, on a personal note, I want to congratulate both Marc and Bret in their new co-CEO partnership. I have been privileged to work closely with both of them for many years, and I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am. for both of them and even more for Salesforce. 
So Jeff, why don't I kick it back to you, and we can open it up for questions?"

And you're right, the shared channels, which the brand name is called Slack Connect, is just one of the most differentiated and exciting parts of Slack as a platform, particularly if you think about the opportunity to integrate Slack with Customer 360. Because as I said, Slack is not just a platform for communicating with fellow employees, it's a platform to engage with your partners, with your customers and integrate with every single application at your company. 
I think the best measure of it in this quarter, I mentioned it in my script, was Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year in the quarter. And I think behind that it was really exciting and Stuart articulated so well, There's a really strong network effect when multiple companies and multiple partners are using this service, it makes the service more valuable. We use Slack Connect with our customers now. 
And I think probably the best example of this past week was Cyber Week. So many of the retailers that I worked with use Slack as their command center for Cyber Week. They would have Salesforce in there. They would have the agencies running their campaigns, their merchandisers. All of these folks are coordinated to drive as much GMV growth as they can in a short period of time. Slack was really at the center of that, and as you said, really about a shared channel with multiple stakeholders. 
So it's a big part of our product strategy, and it's a big part of the strategy for Slack to continue to grow. Candidly, I don't think there's an enterprise product like this in the marketplace that really has network effects from company to company, and we're really excited about it."

Just to give you an idea of the volatility just since Investor Day, we've seen the euro devalue nearly I think it's between 4% and 5% right now. And the Great British pound is down about 2%. And they do have modest impacts on us. 
Now we don't give detailed information about our currency split.

We've talked about that we have a new model. We're taking that extremely seriously, not only just in how we budgeted fiscal year '22, which is what we're finishing right now, but also we're finishing up our budget for fiscal year '23. That obviously also takes into consideration these changes in foreign exchange. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar is something that I'm sure all of you are watching, and we watch as well. We're a global company. These things matter to us. How our numbers shake out always depend on currencies. And there can be variation quarter to quarter based on that. 
So when we look at efficiency, we saw an opportunity when the pandemic hit to really look at how are we spending money overall. And we were really taken by changes in the pandemic cycle: T&E, the use of our real estate marketing spend. And we started to rebalance, to reshape, to rethink about how do we look at our model. Our overall model, not just our revenue model, but our expense model. 
Since we started the company, I would say we never really had an opportunity to look at it. You're on a train. The train is going. The train is working. Why would you make changes to the train? Unless there's a pandemic. That you say, well, I guess we're going to get rid of this to this. 
So the reality is we have the opportunity to start to make changes that we didn't have that opportunity before. And now we've been able to really learn. And I mean we've kind of gone over it a couple of times, but we were [indiscernible] in a year when we acquired this incredible company, the 18.6% is pretty awesome. And we've also given really strong guidance for next year with 20%. And you can see the tremendous operating margin that we've delivered in each of the last 6 quarters. 
So we have tremendous feeling of optimism to the future as we look to having this incredible new model. And is efficiency part of that model? Absolutely. But really, the best part of the model is really optimizing the company in ways that only the pandemic let us do that. 
And I'd love for Amy and Bret to both come in, maybe Gavin too.

Well, this is something I touched on at Investor Day. I truly believe that we can continue to drive growth, and that will continue to be our #1 priority, but we could do so at the same time as driving efficiencies through the business through disciplined decision-making. You heard it from Amy, and it's a mantra that we're using throughout the business. 
And some of the things I talked about then are really to do with providing a tighter grip across the business, deploying best practice across our operating units; when we've got a successful model, how do we replicate it across operating units around the world. I've put a lot more focus on things like participation and driving productivity, so ensuring that we're getting the most value out of our 10,000-person sales force, which is one of our sources of competitive advantage. But how do we make sure everybody is contributing every quarter and that we're looking to eke out both small deals and big deals throughout the year. 
And then finally how do we open up new channels. So the direct model continues to be our strongest muscle, there's no question about that. But we're finding that customers, and not just small customers, are keen to use more and more -- who purchase more and more through digital and online. And that's an area that we're revamping, and it's going to be a bigger part of our overall delivery of new bookings going forward. So the focus for me has been about driving best practice across the Salesforce ecosystem and having a flatter organization that allows for faster decision-making and stronger leadership within the units themselves."

So everything is going well. 
Do you feel the need to make any acquisitions? Or even if you do, do you feel like you can contain all this with the current margin structure? 
And one for Amy, when you look at the tremendous operating efficiencies you've been able to experience in a very short period of time, does that increase your confidence in the longer-term outlook? Granted that you don't have a specific margin target for the longer term. How should we think about the sustainability of the improvement of margins in the longer term, as we watch the incredible success you've had in a very short span of time?"

Especially if you watch the Dreamforce keynote that Bret brought to Slack and Salesforce together with Slack first. And I'd love for him to talk about that. 
Because I think when we get to Dreamforce New York City, which is going to happen on December 8 at Java Center, and I hope all of you will join us there. We'll have 2,000 customers there with us, and we'll be broadcasting that all over the world as well. Well, I think that you'll see that this has fundamentally changed the tone and tempo and future of Salesforce, that we're really a very different kind of company because of this amazing acquisition.
That said, this is a large acquisition. It is taking a lot of work and time from the management team to absorb it. And it still will take several more quarters before we can tell you that we're really running deeply integrated with Slack

My favorite slide at Investor Day with Amy is which we talked about the growth of exact target of MuleSoft or Tableau. And now seeing early return from Slack I think is what superpowers is an organization, and it really requires a lot of focus on the management team. 
Slack is really special though, as Marc said. It's just a moment in time where the way we've worked, which has sort of been As Marc said, it's not what we all planned. We just showed up at work one day, and that's the way work was done, and the whole world is reimagined at the same time. And we have this incredible opportunity to partner with our customers help them with this transformation. 
And no one knows where the world is going. We know we're not going back to the office 5 days a week. And Slack has become such a strategic part of every single customer conversation.
As Marc said, I encourage everyone to either come in person to Java Center on December 8 or watch online on Salesforce Plus and really see the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together. And I think you can see why we're so excited about it and see -- as you can see some of the early returns this quarter as we beat guidance."

There are operational challenges, but the actions that need to be taken are very clear. But it does not change in any way our belief that MuleSoft is fundamental to our ability to deliver our Customer 360.

It's really driven by all these amazing products, but really by this incredible customer success. And we can see it. We're #1 again for the eighth year in a row in CRM according to IDC. It's really exciting. Were you surprised to see that?"

And our sales and service clouds, well, they've become massive individual businesses at this point, generating more than $6 billion each. I mean that's bigger than a lot of cloud companies that I know by themselves. And they're continuing to grow in the double digits. It's amazing. I mean Sales Cloud is amazing this quarter. And operating in the (sic) margin in the quarter was also very good at 19.8%, and that exceeded my expectations. And we delivered $404 million in operating cash flow, up 19% year-over-year. 
And now for fiscal year '22, we're raising our revenue guide again -- just raised it at Investor Day a couple of weeks ago, and now we're raising it again to $26.4 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 24% projected growth year-over-year. That's a $100 million raise since Q2 when we initiated guidance for revenue in December of last year. We've now raised guidance, since that initial -- initiation, $850 million, pretty awesome. 
And we're delighted to raise our full year operating margin once again to 18.6%. We have obviously a new team. We have a new structure now. We're in a new world. We're talking about that. But we have an incredible new model, and it's really reflected in this incredible operating margin performance really for this year and also the operating margin guide for next year as well. And this is really an incredible reflection of this new way that we have -- the new way we're thinking and how we're driving [ the median of ] Salesforce. And as we shared at our Investor Day in September, we're expecting fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $31.8 billion, that's the high end of our range, and operating margin of 20%. 
Now as everyone knows, no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level. We know that because we're talking to other cloud CEOs every day. And I'll tell you, I couldn't be more proud of our Ohana and that Salesforce is soon going to enter the Fortune 100. We've only -- really, if you think about it, we only spent 2 years to the $20 billion. To think about how long I was waiting to get into the $20 billion in revenue for Salesforce, and we're done with it. It's kind of like now we're talking about being in the $30 billion. And I am kind of like, well, I wonder, wow, this is amazing. How long are we going to end up in the $30 billion? So you got to enjoy every moment because it goes fast. 
And you look at the growth, and I really think it's all about this customer success. It's been awesome. I know we're going to tell some great stories here on the call, LVMH and VMware and ADT. And so many of our customers. And we're hearing some great stories from Slack customers too. I'm looking forward to Bret telling you a couple of great stories. 
I've had a great story yesterday from a friend of mine who was at a check-in counter for an airline. And they were using Slack entirely to make the reservation and book the tickets. It's an incredible story with this company. So well, I guess all of this is just an overnight success story for Salesforce doing it now almost a quarter of a century, and it's been a great quarter. 
All right. Well, Bret, congratulations. And why don't you take it from here?"

All in, our commerce and marketing clouds grew 25% year-over-year in our third quarter, continuing an amazing 20-month run as the global economy continues to digitize. 
I also want to talk about Slack. So Slack outperformed our expectations in their first full quarter as a part of the Salesforce family. The number of customers on Slack who spent over $100,000 was up 44% year-over-year. And adoption of Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year. Slack is not just a product. Slack is a network, and it's just incredible to see that growth. 
Slack also continues to innovate at an unbelievable pace. Slack Huddles, which is Slack's new real-time audio capability, is already used weekly by over 1/3 of Slack users. And Slack Clips, the new asynchronous video capability, are being played nearly 1 million times a week. And this month at Slack Frontiers, which I hope all of you have watched; and if you haven't, you can watch it online, Stuart and the team are now the next generation of flash platform, and it's going to truly transform the way companies think about workflows and automation."

You can see in the results of the third quarter for Slack. Slack hit $280 million of revenue, $30 million ahead of guidance. Retailers like Saks and innovative companies like the Southeast Asian ridesharing and food delivery app, Grab, they're relying on Slack every day to collaborate and automate workflows and to connect with their partners. 
And what's exciting to me, Marc, is the deep product innovations we're building between Slack and Customer 360 are already driving success for our customers. I had a great time working with VMware's new CEO, Raghu Raghuram, this quarter. And he's spun VMware out of Dell. And Raghu's team is already using Slack and Service Cloud for case [ handling ] to decrease the time to resolution for their customers. I could not be more excited for the momentum we see in the Slack business, and in particular, Slack's integration into Salesforce. 
As Marc said, we're in a new world. We have a new operating model that's driving durable growth. And our team continues to deliver incredible success for our customers during these unprecedented times. Our core business is stronger than ever and is experiencing incredible growth at scale. Slack and Customer 360 have never been more relevant, and we're playing a pivotal role in supporting our customers' next phase of growth.

And the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together is creating the digital HQ that is enabling our customers to get back to growth. And as Bret said, Salesforce has never been more relevant. 
In the quarter, we saw strong growth in every region, especially in the Americas. We grew relationships with Amazon, Builders FirstSource, IQVIA, Sunbelt Rentals, Tapestry and so many more. In EMEA, we deepened relationships with incredible brands like Fennia, Primark and Puma. And in APAC, we had significant wins with Foxtel, Fujitsu, Hitachi and the New Zealand Ministry of Health. 
Now we all know the incredible security company, ADT. They're using Salesforce Customer 360 to unify their entire customer experience, empowering 4,000 customer service agents and 7,000 field service agents with a complete view of their customers, which is driving operational efficiencies as well as growth. 
And as Bret said, we expanded our partnership with VMware, which has been a Salesforce customer since 2008. This quarter, they kicked off a pilot of Slack plus Service Cloud to accelerate customer support. They also partnered with Tableau to extend data and analytics across their entire business, enabling the presentation of deep analytics to help innovate even faster. 
LVMH continues to expand with Salesforce to deliver luxury goods from anywhere. Globally, 40,000 retail associates and customer service agents use Salesforce to deliver personalized retail journeys for their customers. And our win with the Boohoo Group, which is a leading U.K.-based online fashion retailer, uses our technology to deliver their incredible online shopping experience. With Commerce Cloud, Boohoo is now expanding shopping via social media marketplaces as they look to build for the future. 
And the State of Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles is another great story in the quarter. They selected Salesforce as the platform to power its digital transformation across its entire business. This will mean a whole new experience for residents renewing drivers licenses, credentialing, titling and registering of vehicles and so much more. And this is another great example of digital transformation powered by Salesforce, of course, another great reason to move to Las Vegas. 
These are all great organizations that have pivoted their business to navigate this new world and deliver customer success from anywhere. They're relying on us more than ever and inspiring us to leverage the power of Salesforce Customer 360, Slack and so much more to continue to fuel that business. 
And finally, a word on Q4. I'm really encouraged about how we started the quarter. Demand and pipe look strong, and we're looking forward to a great finish to what has been an exceptional year. 
I want to thank our incredible team for continuing to do such a great job in the midst of a massive global change. The work they do and the technology they deliver power our customers' success, and we couldn't be more grateful.

As we discussed 2 months ago at our Analyst Day, we are in a new world. And we showed our ability to execute in this new world once again in Q3. We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and cash flows. And our focus remains on disciplined and profitable growth. Q3 was also a milestone quarter as it was our first full quarter with Slack. Building on their strong performance over the last several quarters, Slack's early results reinforce our confidence in the strategic importance of this best-in-class asset. 
Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q3 fiscal '22 beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $6.86 billion, which includes $280 million from Slack. This is up 27% year-over-year or 26% in constant currency. The strong demand environment and new business pipeline that we've highlighted on the last few earnings calls continued, allowing us to outperform top line expectations again. 
A few key highlights from the quarter. First launched 22 years ago, Sales Cloud became a $6 billion run rate business this quarter and grew revenue 17%. Sales Cloud now joins Service Cloud, which became a $6 billion business just 2 quarters ago. And Service Cloud continues to grow over 20% at scale. These are 2 massive businesses growing in the double digits, and their success is a testament to the strength of our core. 
Our Americas business is performing extremely well, and we see a healthy demand environment in front of us. New business in North America was especially strong, our largest market that we've been operating in for over 20 years. And as you heard from Bret, Slack continues to outperform our expectations. Slack's had strong customer acquisition with notable strength in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 44% year-over-year. 
Slack Connect's adoption remains strong, with the number of connected endpoints reaching a record level of 176% year-over-year. And we've been able to introduce new customers. Already, 4 of our top 10 deals this quarter included a new Slack win. 
Once again, we saw strong growth in our multi-cloud deals as our customers continued to ask for more than point solutions. In Q3, we recorded 33% year-over-year growth in the number of deals containing 5 or more clouds. 
We did see some headwinds this quarter to our MuleSoft business. When a business is growing as quickly as MuleSoft is, there are scaling challenges you can face, and we experienced some of those challenges this quarter. We are confident in the changes that we have made going forward. As a reminder, a large portion of our MuleSoft revenue is recognized in periods, which has an outsized impact to our second half revenue. MuleSoft remains a critical part our Customer 360, allowing our customers to integrate all of their data and systems. 
Beginning this quarter, with the incorporation of Slack into our financial results, we are providing investors with updated revenue-by-service offering disclosures. Going forward, Slack will be reported in platform and others. We are also creating a new revenue category, data, which will incorporate MuleSoft and Tableau, including Tableau CRM, all of which were previously included in platform and others. We believe this will provide greater transparency into our results. A historical re-class using our new revenue breakdown is available in the earnings deck that we have published alongside our press release. 
And we continue to make great progress on attrition. For the first time in company history, revenue attrition was below 8%. Q3 attrition was between 7.5% to 8%, an improvement versus last quarter's 8% to 8.5%. 
Our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at approximately $36.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in constant currency. Slack represents 4 points of growth, in line with our guidance.
Turning to operating margin. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, which continues to benefit from revenue outperformance, efficiency from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending. 
Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.27. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to stronger revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.27 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.28.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $404 million, up 19% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $166 million, resulting in free cash flow of $238 million, up 11% year-over-year.
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q4 revenue of $7.224 billion to $7.234 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $285 million contribution from Slack in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by another $50 million to $26.3 billion to $26.4 billion. This equates to a total $100 million raise to our revenue guidance since Q2. 
Our guidance now includes $565 million contribution from Slack for the fiscal year. The fiscal year revenue contribution from Slack represents a $35 million increase from our previous guidance. Our full year guidance continues to include $200 million from Acumen. For Q4, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack. 
One thing I will call attention to is that we remain mindful of the strengthening U.S. dollar in our foreign operations, which may impact our financials. We continue to monitor foreign exchange as we execute on what is typically the largest quarter in our fiscal year. 
We expect Q4 GAAP EPS of negative $0.24 to negative $0.23, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 to $0.73. For the full year, this translates to GAAP EPS guidance of $1.28 to $1.29, and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.68 to $4.69. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.49 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. 
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.6%, representing an expansion of 90 basis points year-over-year. The raise in our operating margin guidance is due to refined assumptions around Slack and Acumen. We now expect a 140 basis point headwind or 10 basis points less headwind than our previous guidance. 
I'd like to call out that our guidance continues to incorporate expense seasonality that is weighted to Q4, including investments in both our workforce and growth opportunities and P&E expectations. 
We are raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 4 points, now expecting 18% to 19% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide was primarily driven by strong revenue performance and lower headwinds from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 5 points. 
Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 23% to 24%. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 19% to 20% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, as previously noted, this rate would be 25% to 26%. 
As I shared with you 2 months ago, it is incredibly important to drive this conscious decision-making in every aspect of the company. This new mindset will enable a more durable company as we approach $50 billion. And fiscal '22 represents how we can deliver profitable growth in this new world.
Turning to fiscal '23, we are pleased -- we were pleased to provide our initial revenue and non-GAAP operating margin guidance during our Investor Day. Today, we are initiating Q1 fiscal '23 revenue guidance of $7.215 billion to $7.25 billion or approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. As Gavin mentioned, we're off to a strong start in Q4, and we'll provide you with our complete fiscal '23 guidance as part of our Q4 earnings in February. 
So to close, our business is performing well, and we continue to see record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw its third consecutive quarter of acceleration. And we now have two $6 billion businesses in sales and service. 
Slack is outperforming our expectations, and the integration continues to progress well. And we remain incredibly well positioned with our broad product portfolio and global reach to be able to serve all of our customers. Our products are more relevant than ever.
Finally, on a personal note, I want to congratulate both Marc and Bret on their new co-CEO partnership. I have been privileged to work closely with both of them for many years, and I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for both of them and even more for Salesforce. 
So Jeff, why don't I kick it back to you, and we can open it up for questions?"

You're right, the shared channels, which the brand name is called Slack Connect, is just one of the most differentiated and exciting parts of Slack as a platform, particularly if you think about the opportunity to integrate Slack with Customer 360. Because as I said, Slack is not just a platform for communicating with fellow employees, it's a platform to engage with your partners, with your customers and integrate with every single application at your company. 
I think the best measure of it in this quarter, I mentioned it in my script, was Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year in the quarter. And I think behind that, which was really exciting and Stuart articulated it so well, there's a really strong network effect when multiple companies and multiple partners are using this service. It makes the service more valuable. We use Slack Connect with our customers now. 
And I think probably the best example this past week was Cyber Week. So many of the retailers that I worked with used Slack as their command center for Cyber Week. They would have Salesforce in there. They would have the agencies running their campaigns, their merchandisers. All of these folks are coordinated to drive as much GMV growth as they can in a short period of time. Slack was really at the center of that, and as you said, really about a shared channel with multiple stakeholders. 
So it's a big part of our product strategy, and it's a big part of the strategy for Slack to continue to grow. Candidly, I don't think there's an enterprise product like this in the marketplace that really has network effects from company to company, and we're really excited about it."

Just to give you an idea of the volatility, just since Investor Day, we've seen the euro devalue nearly, I think, between 4% and 5% right now. And the Great British pound is down about 2%. And they do have modest impacts on us. 
Now we don't give detailed information about our currency split. But I can tell you, our international revenue is chiefly driven by 4 currencies: it being the euro, the British pound, the yen, and then to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar.

We've talked about that we have a new model. We're taking that extremely seriously, not only just in how we budgeted fiscal year '22, which is what we're finishing right now, but also we're finishing up our budget for fiscal year '23. That obviously also takes into consideration these changes in foreign exchange. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar is something that I'm sure all of you are watching, and we watch as well. We're a global company. These things matter to us. How our numbers shake out always depend on currencies. And there can be variation quarter to quarter based on that. 
So when we look at efficiency, we saw an opportunity, when the pandemic hit, to really look at how are we spending money overall. And we were really taken by changes in the pandemic cycle: T&E, the use of our real estate, our marketing spend. And we started to rebalance, to reshape, to rethink about how do we look at our model. Our overall model. Not just our revenue model, but our expense model. 
Since we started the company, I would say we never really had an opportunity to look at it. You're on a train. The train is going. The train is working. Why would you make changes to the train? Unless there's a pandemic. That's when you say, ""Well, I guess, we're going to get rid of this and this."" 
So the reality is, we have the opportunity to start to make changes that we didn't have that opportunity before. And now, we've been able to really learn. And I mean, we've kind of gone over it a couple of times, but we -- just in the year when we acquired this incredible company, the 18.6% is pretty awesome. And we've also given really strong guidance for next year with 20%. And you can see the tremendous operating margin that we've delivered in each of the last 6 quarters. 
So we have a tremendous feeling of optimism to the future as we look to having this incredible new model. And is efficiency part of that model? Absolutely. But really, the best part of the model is really optimizing the company in ways that only the pandemic let us do that. And I'd love for Amy and Bret to both come in, maybe Gavin, too. Because this has been a very important part of the management team's work in the last several quarters as we've realized there are some knobs that we can turn that we were just never really allowed to do before, and now we can.

Well, this is something I touched on at Investor Day. I truly believe that we can continue to drive growth, and that will continue to be our #1 priority, but we could do so at the same time as driving efficiencies through the business through disciplined decision-making. You heard it from Amy and it's a mantra that we're using throughout the business. 
And some of the things I talked about then are really to do with providing a tighter grip across the business, deploying best practice across our operating units. When we've got a successful model, how do we replicate it across operating units around the world. I've put a lot more focus on things like participation and driving productivity, so ensuring that we're getting the most value out of our 10,000-person sales force, which is one of our sources of competitive advantage. But how do we make sure everybody is contributing every quarter and that we're looking to eke out both small deals and big deals throughout the year. 
And then finally how do we open up new channels. So the direct model continues to be our strongest muscle, there's no question about that. But we're finding that customers, and not just small customers, are keen to use more and more -- will purchase more and more through digital and online. And that's an area that we're revamping, and it's going to be a bigger part of our overall delivery of new bookings going forward. 
So the focus for me has been about driving best practice across the Salesforce ecosystem and having a flatter organization that allows for faster decision-making and stronger leadership within the units themselves."

Look, we're in a new world. We all know that. And we've all seen all the things that are supposedly happening this week, who knows how much of it is actually true? So we have the ability to adjust and to run the company dynamically. And I think that's why you see such an incredibly strong quarter here in Q3.

One for the co-CEOs and one for the CFO. When you look at the operating model of the company, it is working quite well. You're pretty close to 20% organic growth rate, give or take. Your margins are pretty close to 20%. In fact, you absorbed Slack and did margins that were on par with your best margins before. So everything is going well. Do you feel the need to make any acquisitions? Or even if you do, do you feel like you can contain all this with the current margin structure? 
And one for Amy, when you look at the tremendous operating efficiencies you've been able to experience in a very short period of time, does that increase your confidence in the longer-term outlook? Granted that you don't have a specific margin target for the longer term. How should we think about the sustainability of the improvement of margins in the longer term as we watch the incredible success you've had in a very short span of time?"

Not only into the distribution organization with Gavin and not just with its financial characteristics with Amy, but you can see the tremendous vision. Especially if you watched the Dreamforce keynote that Bret brought to Slack and Salesforce together with Slack first, and I'd love for him Bram to talk about that. 
Because I think when we get to Dreamforce New York City, which is going to happen on December 8 at Javits Center, and I hope all of you will join us there, we'll have 2,000 customers there with us. And we'll be broadcasting that all over the world as well. Well, I think that you'll see that this has fundamentally changed the tone and tempo and future of Salesforce. That we're really a very different kind of company because of this amazing acquisition.
That said, this is a large acquisition. It is taking a lot of work and time from the management team to absorb it. And it still will take several more quarters before we can tell you that we're really running deeply integrated with Slack. And Bret, you've done so much of the leadership here with Slack and with Stuart, so maybe you could just address where we are and how you see the future acquisition environment."

What sets Salesforce apart is how successful we've been able to integrate and grow our acquisition. My favorite slide at Investor Day with Amy, which we talked about the growth of exact target of MuleSoft and Tableau. And now, seeing the early returns from Slack, I think, it's what super powers an organization and it really requires a lot of focus on the management team. 
Slack is really special, though, as Marc said. It's just a moment in time where the way we've worked, which has sort of been -- as Marc said, it's not what we all planned. We just showed up at work one day, and that's the way work was done. And the whole world is reimagined at the same time. And we have this incredible opportunity to partner with our customers and help them with this transformation. And no one knows where the world is going. We know we're not going back to the office 5 days a week. And Slack has just become such a strategic part of every single customer conversation.
As Marc said, I encourage everyone to either come in person to Javits Center on December 8 or watch online on Salesforce Plus and really see the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together. And I think you can see why we're so excited about it and see -- as you can see some of the early returns this quarter as we beat guidance."

Now we have not given long-term guidance beyond FY '23, but I will say we are committed to continuing to improve operating margin. As Bret said, there's a reimagination going on.

Actually, Gavin and I were just talking about this, just before the earnings call, just how important MuleSoft is a lot in our Q4 deals, particularly the Customer 360 deals, where our customers are connecting multiple clouds to multiple back-end systems.

There are operational challenges, but the actions that need to be taken are very clear. But it does not change in any way our belief that MuleSoft is fundamental to our ability to deliver our Customer 360.

And I am kind of like, well, I wonder. Wow, this is amazing. How long are we going to end up in the $30 billions? So you got to enjoy every moment because it goes fast. And you look at the growth, and I really think it's all about this customer success. It's been awesome. I know we're going to tell some great stories here on the call, LVMH and VMware and ADT and so many of our customers. And we're hearing some great stories from Slack customers too. I'm looking forward to Bret telling you a couple of great stories. I even had a great story yesterday from a friend of mine who was at a check-in counter for an airline. And they were using Slack entirely to make the reservation and book the tickets, an incredible story with this company. So well, I guess all of this is just an overnight success story for Salesforce [ and doing ] it now almost 1/4 of a century. And it's been a great quarter.
All right, well, Bret, congratulations. And why don't you take it from here?"

I also wanted to talk about Slack. So Slack outperformed our expectations in the first full quarter as a part of the Salesforce family. The number of customers on Slack who spend over $100,000 was up 44% year-over-year. And adoption of Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year. Slack is not just a product. Slack is a network, and it's just incredible to see that growth. Slack also continues to innovate as an -- at an unbelievable pace.

Slack did $280 million of revenue, $30 million ahead of guidance. Retailers like Saks and innovative companies like the Southeast Asian ridesharing and food delivery app Grab, they're relying on Slack every day to collaborate, to automate workflows and to connect with their partners. And what's exciting to me, Marc, is the deep product innovations we're building between Slack and Customer 360 are already driving success for our customers. I had a great time working with VMware's new CEO, Raghu Raghuram, this quarter as he spun VMware out of Dell. And Raghu's team is already using Slack and Service Cloud [ for case forming ] to decrease the time to resolution for their customers. I could not be more excited for the momentum we see in the Slack business and in particular Slack's integration into Salesforce.
As Marc said, we're in a new world. We have a new operating model that's driving durable growth. And our team continues to deliver incredible success for our customers during these unprecedented times. Our core business is stronger than ever and is experiencing incredible growth at scale. Slack and Customer 360 have never been more relevant, and we're playing a pivotal role in supporting our customers' next phase of growth. And I'm excited to hand it over to Gavin to bring this to life and talk about what [ he's seeing ] with our customers around the globe.

And the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together is creating the digital HQ that is enabling our customers to get back to growth. And as Bret said, Salesforce has never been more relevant.
In the quarter, we saw strong growth in every region, especially in the Americas. We grew relationships with Amazon, Builders FirstSource, IQVIA, Sunbelt Rentals, Tapestry and so many more. In EMEA, we deepened relationships with incredible brands like Fennia, Primark and PUMA. And in APAC, we have significant wins with Foxtel, Fujitsu, Hitachi and the New Zealand Ministry of Health.
Now we all know the incredible security company ADT. They are using Salesforce Customer 360 to unify their entire customer experience, empowering 4,000 customer service agents and 7,000 field service agents with a complete view of their customers, which is driving operational efficiencies as well as growth. And as Bret said, we expanded our partnership with VMware, which has been a Salesforce customer since 2008. This quarter, they kicked off a pilot of Slack plus Service Cloud to accelerate customer support. They also partnered with Tableau to extend data and analytics across their entire business, enabling the presentation of deep analytics to help innovate even faster. LVMH continues to expand with Salesforce to deliver luxury goods from anywhere. Globally, 40,000 retail associates and customer service agents use Salesforce to deliver personalized retail journeys for their customers. And our win with the boohoo group, which is a leading U.K.-based online fashion retailer, uses our technology to deliver their incredible online shopping experience. With Commerce Cloud, boohoo is now expanding shopping via social media marketplaces as they look to build for the future.
And the State of Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles is another great story in the quarter. They selected Salesforce as the platform to power its digital transformation across its entire business. This will mean a whole new experience for residents renewing driver's licenses, credentialing, titling and registering of vehicles and so much more. And this is another great example of digital transformation powered by Salesforce and, of course, another great reason to move to Las Vegas. These are all great organizations that have pivoted their business to navigate this new world and deliver customer success from anywhere. They're relying on us more than ever; and inspiring us to leverage the power of Salesforce Customer 360, Slack and so much more to continue to fuel their business.
And finally, a word on Q4. I'm really encouraged about how we started the quarter. Demand and pipe look strong. And we're looking forward to a great finish to what has been an exceptional year.
I want to thank our incredible team for continuing to do such a great job in the midst of a massive global change. The work they do and the technology they deliver powers our customers' success, and we couldn't be more grateful.

And hello, everyone.As we discussed 2 months ago at our Analyst Day, we are in a new world. And we showed our ability to execute in this new world once again in Q3. We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and cas",1555,"Great. Thank you, Gavin. And hello, everyone.
As we discussed 2 months ago at our Analyst Day, we are in a new world. And we showed our ability to execute in this new world once again in Q3. We delivered on key metrics, strong top and bottom line and cash flows; and our focus remains on disciplined and profitable growth. Q3 was also a milestone quarter, as it was our first full quarter with Slack. Building on their strong performance over the last several quarters, Slack's early results reinforce our confidence in the strategic importance of this best-in-class asset. Now let me walk you through some of the results for Q3 fiscal '22 beginning with top line commentary.
Total revenue for the third quarter was $6.86 billion, which includes $280 million from Slack. This is up 27% year-over-year, or 26% in constant currency. The strong demand environment and new business pipeline that we've highlighted on the last few earnings calls continued, allowing us to outperform top line expectations again.
A few key highlights from the quarter. First launched 22 years ago, Sales Cloud became to -- $6 billion run rate business this quarter and grew revenue 17%. Sales Cloud now joins Service Cloud, which became a $6 billion business just 2 quarters ago. And Service Cloud continues to grow over 20% at scale. These are 2 massive businesses growing in the double digits, and their success is a testament to the strength of our core. Our Americas business is performing extremely well, and we see a healthy demand environment in front of us. New business in North America was especially strong, our largest market that we have been operating in for over 20 years.
And as you heard from Bret, Slack continues to outperform our expectations. [ Slack saw ] strong customer acquisition, with notable strength in the enterprise. The number of paid customers spending greater than $100,000 annually accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 44% year-over-year. Slack Connect's adoption remained strong, with the number of connected end points reaching a record level, up 176% year-over-year. And we've been able to introduce Slack new customers. Already 4 of our top 10 deals this quarter included a new Slack win.
Once again, we saw strong growth in our multi-cloud deals, as our customers continued to ask for more than point solutions. In Q3, we recorded 33% year-over-year growth in the number of deals containing 5 or more clouds. We did see some headwinds this quarter to our MuleSoft business. When a business is growing as quickly as MuleSoft is, there are scaling challenges you can face; and we experienced some of those challenges this quarter. We are confident in the changes that we have made going forward. As a reminder: A large portion of our MuleSoft revenue is recognized in period, which has an outsized impact to our second half revenue. MuleSoft remains a critical part of our Customer 360, allowing our customers to integrate all of their data and systems.
Beginning this quarter, with the incorporation of Slack into our financial results, we are providing investors with updated ""revenue by service offering"" disclosures. Going forward, Slack will be reported in Platform and Other. We are also creating a new revenue category, data, which will incorporate MuleSoft and Tableau, including Tableau CRM, all of which were previously included in Platform and Other. We believe this will provide greater transparency into our results. A historical recast using our new revenue breakdown is available in the earnings deck that we published alongside our press release.
And we continued to make great progress on attrition. For the first time in company history, revenue attrition was below 8%. Q3 attrition was between 7.5% to 8%, an improvement versus last quarter's 8% to 8.5%. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended at -- Q3 at approximately $36.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $18.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in constant currency. Slack represents 4 points of growth, in line with our guidance.
Turning to operating margin. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, which continues to benefit from revenue outperformance, efficiencies from a work-from-anywhere world and a focus on disciplined spending.
Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.47, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.27. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily due to stronger revenue and expense efficiencies as well as realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.27 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.28.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $404 million, up 19% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $166 million, resulting in free cash flow of $238 million, up 11% year-over-year.
Now turning to guidance. We expect Q4 revenue of $7.224 billion to $7.234 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes a $285 million contribution from Slack in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance by another $50 million to $26.3 million (sic) [ $26.3 billion ] to $26.4 billion. This equates to a total $100 million raise to our revenue guidance since Q2.
Our guidance now includes $565 million contribution from Slack for the fiscal year. The fiscal year revenue contribution from Slack represents a $35 million increase from our previous guidance. Our full year guidance continues to include $200 million from Acumen. For Q4, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 19%. This includes 4 points of growth from Slack.
One thing I will call attention to is that we remain mindful of the strengthening U.S. dollar in our foreign operations, which may impact our financials. We continue to monitor foreign exchange as we execute on what is typically the largest quarter in our fiscal year.
We expect Q4 GAAP EPS of negative $0.24 to negative $0.23 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 to $0.73. For the full year, this translates to GAAP EPS guidance of $1.28 to $1.29 and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.68 to $4.69. We expect recent M&A will be an approximately $0.49 headwind to non-GAAP diluted EPS. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assume no further contribution from mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01.
We are also raising our fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.6%, representing an expansion of 90 basis points year-over-year. The raise in our operating margin guidance is due to refined assumptions around Slack and Acumen. We now expect a 140 basis point headwind or 10 basis points less headwind than our previous guidance. I'd like to call out that our guidance continues to incorporate expense seasonality that is weighted to Q4, including investments in both our workforce and growth opportunities and T&E expectations.
We are raising fiscal '22 operating cash flow guidance by 4 points, now expecting 18% to 19% growth year-over-year. The increase from our previous guide is primarily driven by strong revenue performance and lower headwinds from M&A. The dilutive cash flow impact of Slack and Acumen now represents a headwind to our year-over-year growth of approximately 5 points. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A, operating cash flow growth would be 23% to 24%. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal '22, resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 19% to 20% for the fiscal year. Excluding the anticipated impact of M&A as previously noted, this rate would be 25% to 26%. As I shared with you 2 months ago, it is incredibly important to drive disciplined decision-making in every aspect of the company. This new mindset will enable a more durable company as we approach $50 billion, and fiscal '22 represents how we can deliver profitable growth in this new world.
Turning to fiscal '23, we are -- we were pleased to provide our initial revenue and non-GAAP operating margin guidance during our Investor Day. Today, we are initiating Q1 fiscal '23 revenue guidance of $7.215 billion to $7.25 billion or approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. As Gavin mentioned, we're off to a strong start in Q4. And we'll provide you with our complete fiscal '23 guidance as part of our Q4 earnings in February.
So to close. Our business is performing well and we continue to see record levels of revenue and operating margin. Our flagship product in Sales Cloud saw its third consecutive quarter of acceleration, and we now have two $6 billion businesses in sales and service. Slack is outperforming our expectations, and the integration continues to progress well. And we remain incredibly well positioned with our broad product portfolio and global reach to be able to serve all of our customers. Our products are more relevant than ever.
Finally, on a personal note, I want to congratulate both Marc and Bret on their new co-CEO partnership. I have been privileged to work closely with both of them for many years, and I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am for both of them and even more for Salesforce.
So Jeff, why don't I kick it back to you? And we can open it up for questions. Jeff, operator?"

And you're right. The shared channels, which the brand name is called Slack Connect, is just one of the most differentiated and exciting parts of Slack as a platform, particularly if you think about the opportunity to integrate Slack with Customer 360 because, as I said, Slack is not just a platform for communicating with fellow employees. It's a platform to engage with your partners, with your customers; and integrate with every single application at your company. I think the best measure of it in this quarter, I mentioned it in my script, was Slack Connect was up an astonishing 176% year-over-year in the quarter. And I think behind that, what's really exciting, and Stewart articulates this so well, there's a really strong network effect when multiple companies and multiple partners are using this service. It makes the service more valuable. We use Slack Connect with our customers now, and I think probably the best example this past week was Cyber Week. So many of the retailers that I worked with used Slack as their command center for Cyber Week. They would have Salesforce in there. They would have the agencies running their campaigns, their merchandisers. All of these folks are coordinated to drive as much GMV growth as they can in a short period of time. Slack was really at the center of that and, as you said, really about a shared channel with multiple stakeholders, so it's a big part of our product strategy. And it's a big part of the strategy for Slack to continue to grow. And candidly, I don't think there's an enterprise product like this in the marketplace that really has network effects from company to company, and we're really excited about it."

Just to give you an idea of the volatility: Just since Investor Day, we've seen the euro devalue nearly -- I think it's between 4% and 5% right now. And the Great British pound is down about 2%. And they do have modest impacts on us. Now we don't give detailed information about our currency split, but I can tell you our international revenue is chiefly driven by 4 currencies. It'll be the euro, the British pound, the yen and then to a lesser extent the Australian dollar.

We've talked about that we have a new model. We're taking that extremely seriously, not only just in how we budgeted fiscal year '22, which is what we're finishing right now, but also we're finishing up our budget for fiscal year '23. That obviously also takes into consideration these changes, yes, in foreign exchange. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar is something that I'm sure all of you are watching and we watch as well. We're a global company. These things matter to us. How our numbers shake out always depend on currencies and there can be variation quarter to quarter based on that. So when we look at efficiency: We saw an opportunity, when the pandemic hit, to really look at how are we spending money overall. And we were really taken by changes in the pandemic cycle, T&E, the use of our real estate, our marketing spend. And we started to rebalance, to reshape, to rethink about how do we look at our model, overall model, not just our revenue model but our expense model. Since we started the company, I would say, we never really had an opportunity to look at it. You're on a train. The train is going. The train is working. Why would you make changes to the train? Unless there's a pandemic. That's when you say, ""Well, I guess we're going to get rid of this caboose.""
So the reality is we have the opportunity to start to make changes that we didn't have that opportunity before. And now we've been able to really learn. And I mean we've kind of gone over it a couple of times, but we -- [ what we've seen in a year when we acquired this incredible ] company, the 18.6% is pretty awesome. And we've also given really strong guidance for next year with 20%. And you can see the tremendous operating margin that we've delivered in each of the last 6 quarters, so we have a tremendous feeling of optimism to the future as we look to having this incredible new model. And is efficiency part of that model? Absolutely, but really the best part of the model is really optimizing the company in ways that only the pandemic let us do that. And I'd love for Amy and Bret to both come in, maybe Gavin too, because this has been a very important part of the management team's work in the last several quarters as we've realized there are some knobs that we can turn that we were just never really allowed to do before and now we can.

And that will continue to be our #1 priority, but we could do so at the same time as driving efficiencies through the business through disciplined decision-making. You heard it from Amy. And it's a mantra that we're using throughout the business. And some of the things I talked about then are really to do with providing a tighter grip across the business, deploying best practice across our operating units. When we've got a successful model, how do we replicate it across operating units around the world and put a lot more focus on things like participation and driving productivity? So ensuring that we're getting the most value out of our 10,000-person sales force, which is one of our sources of competitive advantage, but how do we make sure everybody is contributing every quarter and that we're looking to eke out both small deals and big deals throughout the year? And then finally, how do we open up new channels? So the direct model continues to be our strongest muscle. There's no question about that, but we're finding that customers and not just small customers are keen to use more and more and -- or purchase more and more through digital and online. And that's an area that we're revamping, and it's going to be a bigger part of our overall delivery of new bookings going forward. So the focus for me has been about driving best practice across the Salesforce ecosystem and having a flatter organization that allows for faster decision-making and stronger leadership within the units themselves."

You're pretty close to 20% organic growth rate, give or take. Your margins are pretty close to 20%. In fact, you absorbed Slack and did margins that were on par with your best margins before, so everything is going well. Do you feel the need to make any acquisitions? Or even if you do, do you feel like you can contain all this with the current margin structure?
And one for Amy. When you look at the tremendous operating efficiencies you've been able to experience in a very short period of time, does that increase your confidence in the longer-term outlook granted that you don't have a specific margin target for the longer term? How should we think about the sustainability of the improvement of margins in the longer term as we watch the incredible success you've had in a very short span of time?"

We're doing a very good job of absorbing Slack and integrating it deeply into the company. Not only into the distribution organization with Gavin and not just with its financial characteristics with Amy, but you can see the tremendous vision and especially if you watched the Dreamforce keynote that Bret brought to Slack and Salesforce together with Slack, first. And I'd love for him to talk about that because I think, when we get to Dreamforce New York City, which is going to happen on December 8 at Javits Center -- and I hope all of you will join us there. We'll have 2,000 customers there with us and we'll be broadcasting that all over the world as well. Well, I think that you'll see that this has fundamentally changed the tone and tempo and future of Salesforce, that we're really a very different kind of company because of this amazing acquisition. That said, this is a large acquisition. It is taking a lot of work and time from the management team to absorb it. And it still will take several more quarters before we can tell you that we're really running deeply integrated with Slack. I mean -- and Bret, you've done so much of the leadership here with Slack and with Stewart, so maybe you could just address where we are and how you see the future acquisition environment."

What sets Salesforce apart is how successful we've been able to integrate and grow our acquisitions. My favorite slide at Investor Day was Amy's, [ when she, when we ] talked about the growth of ExactTarget, of MuleSoft and Tableau; and now seeing the early returns from Slack. I think it's [ one of our superpowers as an organization's ], and it really requires a lot of focus from the management team. Slack [ does feel really special, though ], as Marc said. It's just a moment in time where the way we've worked, which has sort of been -- as Marc said, it's [ not something we all planned ]. We just showed up at work one day and that's the way work was done, and the whole world was reimagined at the same time. And we have this incredible opportunity to partner with our customers and help them with this transformation. And it's no one knows where the world is going. We know we're not going back to the ""office 5 days a week."" And Slack has just become such a strategic part of every single customer conversation. And as Marc said, I encourage everyone to either come in person to Javits Center on December 8 or watch online on Salesforce+ and really see the power of Salesforce Customer 360 and Slack together. And I think you can see why we're so excited about it and see -- as you can see some of the early returns this quarter as we beat guidance."

Our ultimate vision of where all of that is going, well, that's still something that we're continuing to reveal and is being revealed to us, so it's a dynamic process and it requires all of our attention.

We have not given long-term guidance beyond FY '23, but I will say we are committed to continuing to improve operating margin. As Bret said, there's a reimagination going on.

So we feel very confident in the decisions we've made and have to get through a bit of this change management we were seeing in the short-term results, but we feel very confident in the future of MuleSoft and certainly no change to the demand environment. Actually Gavin and I were just talking about this just before the earnings call, just how important MuleSoft [ is a lot ] in our Q4 deals, particularly the Customer 360 deals where our customers are connecting multiple clouds to multiple back-end systems; and how much integration is such an important part of our customer conversation.

You ask about the seasonality of data in our new reporting matrix. So one of the advantages of breaking up the revenue this way is, I think, it really provides greater transparency to all of our investors. And what this will do is it will put Tableau and MuleSoft, which are 2 primarily licensed-based offerings, together in the same line, so I don't think it's so much a question of seasonality, but it's a question actually of lumpiness. Because of the way that we recognize the revenue in period, you were simply going to see more variability in those -- in that line than you would in other areas.
