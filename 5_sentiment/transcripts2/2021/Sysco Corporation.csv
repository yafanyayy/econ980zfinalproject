I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. During this morning's call, I will spend time discussing Sysco's recent performance. I will provide an update on our business transformation, and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery. I'll then turn it over to Aaron, who will discuss Sysco's second quarter fiscal results. 
As we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption. We have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity and business investments. To that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our company for long-term success. I am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track, and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors. 
The COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food-away-from-home sector and has disrupted our marketplace. In light of those realities, we are pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021. And for the second quarter, we performed generally in line with our expectations adjusted for the environment. While our second quarter financial results were down compared to prior year, we delivered a profitable quarter despite 23% decline at our top line sales and funded investments to enable our transformation. 
Our customers experienced increasingly restrictive conditions on their operations during the second quarter, which were most notable in December when restaurant traffic and sales declined. Additionally, our international segment has been hard hit due to tougher restrictions in the countries in which we operate. At Sysco, we are not taking the restrictions on customers as a gravity issue. We are doing more than ever before to help our customers navigate this challenging environment. 
I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we are having in winning new business. 
We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021. Those investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter, and Aaron will speak more to this in a moment. 
Examples of investments during the second quarter include investments in our customers, in our people, and our working capital and in our technology. I'd like to highlight some examples of each of these purposeful choices. 
Investments in our customers, including our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which makes it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. A visual representation of our Restaurants Rising campaign can be found on Page 6 of our presentation. 
Most notably, we announced in November that we are eliminating minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, which provides operators significant flexibility in managing their business and makes it easier to order what they need when they need it. In addition, we are not eliminating delivery service days during the second wave of COVID, a practice we know a select competition is currently doing. We see the light at the end of the tunnel and as such, we are prioritizing customer service. A little incremental expense right now is a small price to pay for customer loyalty and partnership. 
Our sales consultants are leveraging the Restaurants Rising program to retain current customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones. In addition to the no order minimums commitment, Sysco sales consultants are assisting their customers with setting up touchless menus, optimizing delivery and take-out operations and helping with marketing programs to create awareness of our customers' operations. Just to name a few of our value-added services. 
I am proud to report that our Net Promoter Score increased by more than 1,000 basis points in the quarter, due in large part to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurant Rising program. The NPS increase was our largest quarterly increase in our company's history. 
Importantly, as you can see on Page 7 in our slides, the incremental closure rate of Sysco's customers is 50% below the industry average. And lastly, we onboarded more new local customers in Q2 than in any single quarter in the last 5 years. 
In addition to investing in our customers, we are making investments in our people. We are intentionally retaining drivers despite a volume decline in December to ensure we have them available for our pending volume recovery. Drivers are in short supply across the country. And while this investment will drive some incremental transportation expense in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery. 
As you know, we made changes to our sales organization and sales compensation during the summer. Our associate retention has improved compared to historical retention rates and our improved retention will help with sales productivity metrics in the future. 
We are beginning to make investments in working capital to position the right products in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery. Sysco has the broadest inventory assortment in the industry. Our ability to ship products on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry. We have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and in inventory, while other foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters. 
We are also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity. Lastly, we are making strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. This includes our Sysco Shop technology, our new pricing software and improvements we are making in our supply chain systems. 
Sysco's ability to invest in our customers, our people, our inventory and our technology, while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our leadership team. 
I'd like to turn now to providing an update on our business transformation. 
First, as we have shared previously, we are focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customers' experience with Sysco and drive incremental sales. Priority number one is improving our mobile ordering platform, Sysco Shop. Notably, we are now on-boarding new customers in less than 24 hours, a step-change improvement. The number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continues to meaningfully increase throughout the quarter. Additionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region. We are learning a lot through this regional pilot, and we remain on track to roll out the pricing system across the country. The goal of this effort is to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive incremental sales and gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level. 
Additionally, by automating customer-level pricing, we will free up time for our valued sales consultants to spend with customers on value-added activities, such as menu design, Sysco brain penetration and other drivers of sales and margin. 
Second, we are improving our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process. Through our sales transformation, we have an improved more customer-centric organizational structure. Our sales transformation is progressing well, and the team-based selling approach is gaining traction. We have created and filled new specialist selling positions. We have implemented a sales quarterback position that helps guide the collective sales teams across a given geography. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we have launched our first cuisine segment go-to-market selling strategy, and we are seeing initial signs of success with that customer segment through incremental market share gains. We will roll out this program to additional cuisine segments in calendar 2021. 
Lastly, Sysco completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the start of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that our new regional presidents are in place and are finding quick wins to improve our business. 
The average tenure of our market and regional leaders is over 20 years. And these experienced and talented leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco. Examples of quick wins include: optimizing our inventory assortment across multiple physical sites, and optimizing the servicing of key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location services each customer location. 
To be a great company, you need to have a world-class leadership team. I am pleased that during the quarter, we made important progress in strengthening our leadership team. Aaron Alt joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer. Aaron is with us today, and you'll be hearing from him next. 
Aaron is a proven finance leader with over 20 years of experience in foodservice and retail leadership positions. He has a track record of transformation and a value creation at large organizations in multiple industries. 
Additionally, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Tom has experienced leading enterprise information technology strategy, services, operations, risk and cybersecurity from large global enterprises. In his most recent role, he worked for a global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly applicable to the transformational journey at Sysco. 
Additionally, Tim Ørting has officially started his position, leading our international division. Tim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies. With Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce the number of my direct reports by 4, which allows me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the strategy development and execution of the company. 
Joel Grade has begun his new role, leading business development, and is actively engaged in identifying new sources of growth for Sysco. I am pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete. We have a strong management team that balances Sysco and foodservice industry expertise with best-in-class experience from other industries. Our new leaders join a talented and an experienced Sysco leadership team. 
Greg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business, has over 35 years of industry experience in 30 years specific with Sysco. Greg's expertise and steady hand in running our largest business during the COVID disruption has been invaluable. I appreciate his leadership and the strong impact he has on our results. 
Great leadership teams work as a team on a common agenda. Our transformation strategy has galvanized this leadership team around a common purpose and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for foodservice distribution for many years to come. 
I report to you today with strong confidence that a pending business recovery sits before us. As vaccine administration makes progress across the globe, the restrictions currently placed upon our customers will begin to ease. We can see in our performance data that once those restrictions ease, consumers are ready and willing to eat away from home. 
At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other foodservice distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers. And our customer success will generate business growth for Sysco. 
In closing, I'd like to give a sincere thank you to all Sysco associates who are working hard to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. Our industry-leading sales force has been inspired by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than any point in our proud history. 
Our warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working hard every day to ensure we ship to our customers what they want, when they need it. I am proud of their dedication during this challenging operating time. 
I also want to thank our customers for their resilience, the grit that they have shown and the fight that they have displayed during this pandemic. At Sysco, our customers are an inspiration to us, and we will show them just as much determination and how we serve them. 
I will now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our second quarter results, along with additional financial details. Aaron, welcome to Sysco, and over to you."

Before I joined Sysco, what I can see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. Now that",1640,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I am really excited to be at Sysco. Before I joined Sysco, what I can see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. Now that I'm on the inside, I see all of that. In addition to a driven leadership team, relentlessly focused on being ready for the business recovery and on driving a customer and capability-led transformation. In short, I see many opportunities in front of us to create shareholder value. 
I will start today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow. Second quarter sales were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year, but flat to the prior quarter. Sales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November as restrictions eased, but new lockdown restrictions during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the international segment. 
Here are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased to 19.7%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%. We do know that there is keen interest in the continued impact of COVID. The answer varies by region. Europe went into lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a significant portion of the second half. However, since the week after the holidays, we have been seeing signs of life from volume improvements in our USFS business and SYGMA continues to grow. This panel will be fought week-by-week, region-by-region for the next couple of quarters until the vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold. The only commitment we can make is that we will be ready and more competitive than ever. 
As we move down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points as our rate came in at 18.2%. 
A couple of thoughts on that. First, we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter as we did this year. Second, our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, and its partner segment, SYGMA, each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-COVID quarter, which is frankly remarkable given the market dynamics. 
Given the growth of our national accounts business at SYGMA, which is lower margin, we did see business mix shift, which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change. Our enterprise margin was also impacted by the international and other businesses as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed. 
Our expense profile changed over the course of our second quarter as adjusted operating expense decreased 15.3% to $1.9 billion. This expense profile reflects the deleverage of our cost structure as sales remained down 0.3%. 
These results arise from some purposeful choices. First, and on the positive side of the equation, we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network. We also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant swings in case volume. 
Second, we continue to make excellent progress against our $350 million of cost savings initiatives in fiscal 2021. I can see the savings in the detailed income statement, and we continue to identify and pursue more opportunities. 
Third, but on the other side of the equation, we have made the purposeful choice to leverage our financial strength to prepare for the business recovery before it happens. As previously announced, we changed our sales consultant compensation to include both a fixed and variable component to drive retention and focus on key operational metrics. We can see that change working in our market wins. 
Additionally, we brought back hundreds of associates in the second quarter in support of our business model. In the third quarter, and indeed the back half, we anticipate we will hire thousands of additional sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts and operations associates in anticipation of the pending business recovery. We plan to be ahead of the recovery curve, not catching up, and we have the financial resources to do just that. 
Finally, as Kevin mentioned, we continue to make purposeful investments in our capability builds in support of our transformation: pricing, customer experience, sales, vendor management and personalization. While we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters, the investment dollars are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter, and we'll do so in the back half. When combined with the impact of slower openings in our international segment, we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than originally anticipated. However, as volume returns and grows, whether due to market recovery or our purposeful investments, we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and expect that over the next several quarters, the impact of the cost savings efforts separate from the ongoing investments will be more visible. 
Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 63% to $234 million. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.8% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 80% to $0.17 for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to our second quarter results by business segment, starting with the U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 23.9% versus the prior year period. Notwithstanding the difficult environment, the business acquired a record number of new customers as our sales teams hit the streets, and we deployed digital tools. We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. 
Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased 165 basis points to 36.5% for total U.S. cases, driven by the customer and product mix shift. With respect to local U.S. cases, Sysco brand sales decreased 455 basis points to 42%, which was driven by product mix shift into prepackaged and takeaway-ready products. 
Gross profit decreased 24% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. Though as I called out earlier, gross margin was flat for the quarter at 19.7% as the business very successfully managed through the puts and takes of the COVID environment and addressed headwinds such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shift out of higher-margin categories like PP&E. 
The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 18.9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 33% to $472 million. 
Moving on to the SYGMA segment. Sales increased 4% to $1.5 billion compared to the prior year period, driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurant servicing drive-thru traffic. This is the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment. 
We continue to see new business wins in the SYGMA segment and are pleased by the overall improvement. Gross profit increased 4.1% to $129 million for the quarter, and gross margin was flat to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4%, $118 million, and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $11 million. 
Moving to the international segment. Our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses have been substantially impacted by recent shutdowns which are more aggressive than lockdowns in the U.S. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $2 billion, a decrease of 32%, while gross profit decreased 36.2% and  gross margin decreased 128 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of adverse market mix, customer mix, product mix and aged inventory. 
For the international segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 16%, and adjusted operating income decreased 175% for an operating loss of $55 million. 
Our other segment, which includes our guest worldwide business, remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. However, the business is in better shape than many of its competitors, and has achieved a number of recent customer wins, including being named the preferred distributor for Renaissance Hotels, JW Marriott and Westin Hotels via a new contract with Avendra in both the U.S. and Canada. And being given access to all Marriott properties in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. 
While still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment, the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was $788 million year-to-date, which is in line with our previously noted guidance. Net CapEx for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $148 million, which was $235 million lower than last year as the company carefully assessed its capital investment choices in the face of COVID. 
Sysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective. At quarter end, we had balance sheet cash of $5.8 billion, plus access to $2 billion of available borrowing capacity for a total of $7.8 billion. 
Our cash and available liquidity ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company. We continue to monitor our operating environment carefully. And as we assess reopening time lines and investment needs consistent with the transformation, we will be updating our views of our levels of cash and capital structure opportunities in future calls. 
Although this is a tough operating environment for our customers, which will impact our results for the next quarter or 2, Sysco remains resolutely focused on managing its businesses, aggressively preparing for the business recovery, and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. 
We believe our strategy and our transformational initiatives will drive future value for our associates, shareholders and customers.

I would actually say from a transformation perspective, we're ahead of schedule. I've said this many, many times in our company town hall meetings and then private conversations with investors, while the COVID crisis has obviously been tremendously difficult on the customers that we serve in our environment overall, the silver lining in that dark cloud is we've used it as an opportunity to accelerate our transformation. 
I've mentioned before, our regionalization program, we had a plan to complete that over 2 years, and it's now done, as you heard me say on our prepared remarks on today's call. So our ability to accelerate change management, the buy-in from our experienced team on the impetus for change, meaningfully improved. 
And so when you look at our selling model, our leadership model, our technology tools, I would say, we're ahead of the schedule on those activities, and I'm pleased with where we are, and we're very confident that these transformation initiatives are going to enable our company to be very successful. 
What we need, obviously, is the overall business environment to improve for all of those activities to be more visible in our results than they currently are, but we can see the internal data, and it's promising. 
Alex, the last thing I would just say is your team, to have a great company, you need to have a great team, and I said in my prepared remarks. We have a really strong team now that we've built at Sysco, which is a combination of extremely experienced leaders like Greg Bertrand, who runs our, by far, largest business and new leaders that have joined our company that can help bring best practices from other industries and frankly, key capabilities that we need at our company. Like Judy, who's joined us as our Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Peck, who's joined us from a technology perspective. And then obviously, Aaron, who you heard from today, who is just a really terrific talented financial executive and transformation executive to help accelerate our results. 
So in summary, Alex, I would say, I think we're ahead of schedule. And looking forward, like all of you are, to have COVID behind us so we can prove it in our outcomes."

As it relates to what we're investing in, if you put it into 2 buckets, we have some key initiatives that we are investing in, which is the building of capabilities and, in many instances, technology that will advance our ability to be a better company in the future, and that's our pricing project. We're building a customer personalization engine to improve the type of offers that we provide to our customers using machine learning and predictive analytics to help our sales force be more effective. We're going to talk with you more about that at an Investor Day that we plan on holding in May. Neil will send out more details on that Investor Day. 
We know we owe you more specifics on our transformation, the size of that price, and we will cover those details with you at that May Investor Day. 
As it relates to the other half of the ""investments"", we do see a pending business recovery. We see a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not a train coming towards us. It's the dawning of a new more promising day. We can see it in our data. 
Here are the facts behind what happens. As soon as restaurant restrictions are eased, our business immediately pops. And how do we know that? We know that because states like Florida and Texas, with limited restrictions, our business is substantially better than our national average. We can see it in states like California, which just allowed for, at the state level, the reopening of outdoor dining, which is important in a state that has quality weather, and the state of New York has now begun the easing of restrictions with New York City reporting this week that Valentine's Day in-restaurant dining will be authorized again. So we see immediate jumps in our business when that happens. 
The reason you're hearing some tempering of enthusiasm from us specific to Q3 is we have an international business that is under severe lockdown. You probably all know this, but I just want to be really clear about this. In international, specifically Europe, restaurants are closed. Europe is currently in operating conditions that are similar to what the United States was experiencing back in April and May. In London, for instance, you can only leave your house for an hour a day. You can only go to the grocery store, to the park, and you need to stay within 5 kilometers of your home. I mean, it's that locked down. And they don't have drive-thrus to the degree that we have them in the United States. 
So in the Europe business, our sales have been significantly impacted. Most notably, the European governments have come out and said that they don't anticipate easing those restrictions until roughly Easter. So we're going to be really careful and thoughtful in Europe. We will move at a slower pace in Europe, and we will meter our investments in that business tied to that business's recovery. 
But in the United States, we believe that the progress that's being made in vaccination is substantial. The at-risk population being protected. Now moving on to category 1b, 1c and eventually categories 2 and 3. As vaccines make progress, as the death rate comes down, as ICU bed capacity improves, that will give governors the confidence to ease restrictions. And when that happens, our business immediately pops. So we need to do things in preparation for that, and that's what Aaron is referring to. We need to get inventory back into our facilities. We need to staff up in both warehouse and in driver positions to ensure that when our customers are ready to place orders, we're not putting out a job rick and trying to fill a job and then the time delay that comes along with that. So we have the financial strength to do that. It's a purposeful choice. 
And I'll just leave you with this last comment, then I'm going to toss it to Aaron. And choices in service right now, we had to cut delivery frequency back in what is our period of April, May and June of last fiscal year, we've purposely chosen not to do that this time. We are servicing our customers 6-plus days a week. We're not cutting delivery frequency. We waived order minimums. All of these things are to help our customers during their difficult COVID wave 2. And that's a choice we made. We believe that's a choice that will pay itself forward with loyalty and future growth. And that 1,000 basis points of NPS improvement that I covered in my prepared remarks, that is a notable, notable reflection. And those that understand NPS understand that, that is a pay-it-forward metric that will benefit our company into the future. 
So Aaron, I'll toss it over to you specific to Q3, if there's anything you wanted to add to that."

We don't provide quarterly guidance per se, but what I'd like to do is take a moment and give you some context on Q3 by talking a bit more about Q2 than what we saw there. I believe there are some parallels. As you will",503,"Great. Thank you for the question. We don't provide quarterly guidance per se, but what I'd like to do is take a moment and give you some context on Q3 by talking a bit more about Q2 than what we saw there. I believe there are some parallels. As you will have observed from our release and from the comments, we experienced deleveraging during the second quarter as sales dropped 23% from prior year. 
And you will recall from prior earnings calls that Joel had previously observed that our cost structure is approximately 1/3, 2/3 split between fixed and variable costs. You can do the math on what that should mean for the quarter versus our prior year. 
I would comment that we benefited extensively from efficiency efforts. I called out some of them during the call. And specific identified and executed cost savings during the quarter, the quarterly component of the $350 million that the team has been talking about for the last couple of quarters. 
I commented during the results that we could see the savings in the P&L. And let me give you a couple of examples of that. People, overall, across the enterprise, we have 15,100 fewer employees today than we did a year ago. And that includes a significant cut at our corporate headquarters as well. We've identified and executed specific COGS, cost savings that I can see in the P&L. We've rationalized our technology investments to be more forward focused. We've identified indirect cost savings, professional costs, et cetera. 
So what I want you to take away is the cost savings are real. And while we haven't disclosed the exact level of what it is quarter-to-quarter, it's material, and they're out there. 
Now the cost savings are important because they offset a combination of 2 things going on, and I would have you think about it as really, call it, a 50-50 spread. The first is, as Kevin just talked about, we did make incremental investments against both the business recovery and the transformation in the quarter. We purposely used some of our savings from those cost savings initiatives to fund the investments against the short-term recovery and the long-term transformation. And then there was a mix of other onetime expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging that we experienced and those probably are getting low as going on in Europe and other parts of our network. 
To summarize, we do believe that some incremental expense now is worth it, and it gets us ready for the recovery to come. Some of the investments and costs that I called out earlier will continue into the back half, particularly into Q3. We want to be transparent about that. But importantly, as we get into the true end of the year and into next year, those same savings, they're structural, they're recurring, they're real, and they will become much more apparent as we reverse the sales decline and get the early investments and the recovery and the transformation behind us."

Just -- it's a both end on the strength of the stronger players, right? Strength gets stronger during times of diversity and crisis.

Strength gets stronger during times of diversity and crisis. And what Aaron just referring to is the $350 million of cost takeout is real, it's concrete, and we can track it. And as our volume gets back to pre-COVID levels, and it will, that's going to flow straight to the bottom line. The reason it's less visible now is because we have all these other things happening vis-à-vis investments in the recovery, investments in new capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. But that $350 million is hard, real, and it will be visible as our volume recovers. So -- and we're not done. We've said that before, too. We are not done with structural cost improvement. There's more to be attained. And again, that's something we can talk about more at our May Investor Day. 
Specific on the revenue side, the number we've quoted explicitly is the national sales win. It's impressive. It's material. $1.5 billion of net new wins in the national sales segment. You can see it in our performance results in SYGMA. And also, you can see it in our performance results and just our general overall case growth. 
But what we haven't explicitly quantified for you because it's challenging with what's happening in the marketplace, is the wins we're having at the local level. In my prepared remarks, I said the following: we won more new customers at the independent local level in Q2 that at any point in time over the last 5 years. That's as concrete and as specific as I can be, and it's real. We can track it. We use a tool called Sysco 360 to track every customer activity. Those wins are going to be visible, again, as our volume recovers. The reason it's less visible on top line growth is because the average order per customer is currently down because of COVID. In a takeout and delivery world, customers order fewer appetizers, fewer desserts. They tend -- they focus more on that main entrée. And so the average volume per customer is down but we've added a substantial number of new customers, and that's not just in the U.S. that applies to Canada, that applies to all of our businesses in Europe as well. So that will be a pay-it-forward activity. 
And what we anticipate we will be able to show you, at our May Investor Day, is what is the size of the prize of all of these activities worth? The trajectory that we are on from a sales growth perspective. And then these key enabling transformational elements what they're worth from a market share capture perspective and then how that flows through to the bottom line. 
Before we go to your follow-up, I'll just ask, Aaron, if there's anything he wants to add to what I just said."

I can, however, put a little more color on the examples that I was just providing. And I also realize that the second half of your first question, which was tied to the smaller competitors, how are they performing. I didn't sufficiently answer that on the first question. 
There's no doubt that the bigger players are getting stronger. I have been asked directly before, Kevin, how is it true that each of the major players are reporting that they are winning market share. Well, it is true. That is what is happening and what that mathematically implies is that smaller players are currently donating share. Most likely because they don't have the ability to invest in inventory during a period of volume growth. We know for a fact that select competitors are cutting delivery frequency. They cut Saturday first. They cut Wednesday second. We have not done that, Jeff. So we have not canceled Saturday. We have not canceled Wednesday. In fact, as you well know, we eliminated order minimums. 
We are seeing improvement in our trends for the customers that we serve as those programs have been launched, which is Restaurants Rising, and we are seeing retention of customers because we're not cutting back on service. 
A data point that I've quoted before is for those customers that have joined us on this Restaurant Rising campaign, leveraging our menu services, leveraging our ability to help them with takeout and delivery, they are performing 20% on average better than the customers that choose not to engage. Our priority, obviously, is to get more and more and more of them engaged and we're working on that. 
The second one, I'd just take you to Page 7 in our deck. And that is the closure rate of Sysco customers. So this chart has been normalized to -- a normal year would be at 0. And our closure rate of our customers is 50% lower than the national average. And this data doesn't come from our internal systems, this data comes from Yelp. 
So as I put, 1,000 basis points improvement in NPS, we've won more new customers in this quarter than in 5-plus years. When I put the closure rate of our customers, it's 50% less than the industry average and that we can see market share gains. These things give you confidence that Sysco will be a net winner in the business. And when you layer on the future periods, where others are going to meaningfully struggle, Joel made this point many different times, others are going to really struggle with building inventory in advance of the sales actually hitting their business because that's a period of balance sheet stress. We have the capability because the strength of our balance sheet to build inventory in advance of the customer ordering, Jeff, that's a big deal."

We have not disclosed the build rate of the $350 million plus of synergies or cost savings that we are identifying as we carry forward. But as you're trying to model, what I would encourage you to do is to look at or reflect on my comment that approximately 50% of what we saw in the quarter was our investments against the transformation and against the business recovery and 50% was onetime expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging in parts of the portfolio. That's interesting, but the really important point is that, look, the onetime costs, they are onetime and will go away. And any fixed cost deleveraging as the tide rises with sales, that will also disappear. And the investments against the recovery and the against -- investments against the transformation. While they may occur for a couple of quarters, they are also transitory in nature, and we will have the -- we'll have the benefit of achieving the run rate savings that Joel had called out previously in future quarters.

A bigger picture question. Trying to understand if retention of your own employees and Net Promoter Scores should be tied together, so I guess the question I would pose is you talked about retention being improved. And I'm wondering if that's the right way to ask? Or to tie those 2 things together? So this question might sound challenging. It's literally not meant to be, but I mean you forced turnover, right? And where would anyone else go? So I mean, indeed, retention, by definition, always has to improve. So I was wondering if are people making more or less? Are you offering more benefits? What kind of feedback? And is that the correlation to Net Promoter scores? If it is, as Net Promoter Scores go up, what happens then? I mean I know it's sales, but could you tie that, for example, to wallet share, of independence, which is 30% versus 40% change? Did local independent wallet share go up? I just wanted to see how it kind of ties together, if that makes sense."

It's -- the spirit of your question is excellent, and I appreciate you're asking it. I'm going to unpack it in 2 ways. One is NPS is our customers' voice to us, and we have a large sample size. We track it real time, and we take action on it. And we see, in our NPS data, where we have strength. The by far biggest strength of Sysco is our sales consultants. We massively over-index our competitors in the quality and support given to our customers through that audience. By far, our biggest strength is our sales consultants. Such a strength, we will continue to leverage, and I'm going to get to that in a minute when I talk about what I meant by associate retention. 
So we need to continue to harness, in fact, further leverage our biggest strength. And Nicole, what we need to do on NPS to make an overall improvement lift is address the pain points, right? So here are things we were hearing through this COVID crisis as a pain point. Kevin, my volume is down, but yet you have these order minimums. You're willing to come 1 time per week during this period of time when my volume is down because you cut Saturday delivery. So we just leaned into it, and we addressed it hard. What we did is we ensured that this COVID wave 2, we were not going to cut delivery frequency. And the biggest pain point we heard was from our restaurant operators. I can't predict what my order volume is going to be, and I'm really worried about your minimum orders. And we eliminated that problem for them. We just took it off the table. From now through the end of this crisis, and it very well might be permanent, we are not asking for order minimums. We're here to ship what they need, when they need it, regardless of the order volume on the regularly scheduled delivery day, and we're not going to cut delivery frequency. 
So Nicole, here's what happened. The associate piece of that NPS survey got even higher because our sales consultants are leaning into helping restaurant operators with menu design and takeout and delivery and hooking them up with a delivery partner. And then the pain point of delivery, we meaningfully improved. If you put the 2 together, we saw 1,000 basis points lift. 
What that will do for our business in the future is higher customer retention and higher share of wallet. If you study the NPS, there is a lag, right? So as you improve NPS meaningfully, it is in the forward-facing quarters and into years when that results in higher retention and higher share of wallet. It's not an immediate A then B. But we're confident that we're doing the right things in support of our customers, and they will reward us with business. 
What I referred to in my script, as it relates to associate retention, was tied to our sales consultant compensation change that we made this summer. Now why we made the sales compensation change was twofold. One, we had some disincentives in our old structure that motivated our sales consultants to do some things that were inconsistent with our company strategy, point one. Point two, we had too much turnover, especially in our newer associates. They were on a full commission previously, and they just simply, in those early years, couldn't earn enough when they were on full commission to make it through their learning curve as they built their business. In our new model, we have a base plus bonus structure where they make a livable wage off of their base and then they have the opportunity to make a very healthy income through their bonus. That was implemented this summer. Change is hard when you implement a new tool like that. But statistically and significantly statistically -- excuse me, statistically significant, I meant to say, we are seeing improvements in retention. And it's not just because we reduced the number of people earlier in the year. It is because actually, the folks that we're tracking that have been here before, during and after COVID, we're seeing retention at a higher rate attributable to that change in comp. 
But Nicole, I'll toss it back to you to see if there's any follow-up to anything I just said."

There's too much volatility in that type of metric to be that specific on a call. What I can definitely say, however, is that for the customers that have engaged with us on the Restaurants Rising campaign, yes, we win more share of wallet with them, and we retain them. There's a lot of churn in this industry. Many customers use multiple distributors, 2 or 3 distributors. There are reasons why they do that. And what we're seeing in the Restaurants Rising campaign and the work we're doing with our transformation is that a customer is less needing to have multiple distributors. 
I'll introduce one of our other strategic initiatives, which is our pricing initiative, the number one reason why a customer leaves Sysco to go to a competitor and vice versa, frankly, is because of price. And specifically, transparency for price. They think they can get a price somewhere else, so they want to keep their distributor honest by taking portions of their business and bringing it to a competitor. As we implement our pricing software, and we give customer item-specific pricing, pricing that's right at the item level, we believe that we will lose less individual lines to competitors tied to price. And frankly, the opposite will have the opportunity to win incremental cases with existing customers because we will be right on price for the items that matter, which will drive volume growth and how to keep margins neutral is on inelastic items that are on the tail of the inventory assortment, you can take some nominal increases on price to offset the margin dilution. 
All in, we're bullish on our ability to increase share of wallet. When we meet in May, at our Investor Day, we'll be able to explain in more detail what we believe is possible from a share wallet growth perspective, but we have customers to answer your question specifically that are well north of 30% with Sysco."

I just want to clarify 1 thing on the thousands comment that was in Aaron's prepared remarks, that thousands applied to each of the things that were after what he said. He said, sales associates, warehouse associates, drive",674,"John, good question, as always. I just want to clarify 1 thing on the thousands comment that was in Aaron's prepared remarks, that thousands applied to each of the things that were after what he said. He said, sales associates, warehouse associates, drivers and support resources. So the thousands declarative applies to the cumulative of all of them. So we're not going to be hiring thousands of new sales associates. We will hire new sales associates, we're hiring new specialists, we're hiring national business developers -- I'm sorry, new business developers, NBD, is what we call them, to grow our business. But the majority of the 1,000s comment is actually in the warehouse and driver populations simply tied to the business volume recovery that we anticipate. 
As Aaron quoted, we have 15,000 fewer people working for us today than we did pre-COVID. And we will and expect to get back to pre-COVID volume levels down the road and we need to hire up to be able to staff up, to be able to support that business recovery. 
I just want to be really clear. It's not -- today, it's a 0 and tomorrow, it's thousands. It's a week-by-week staffing plan. And we will be able to throttle it up and throttle it down based upon what we see and our data, but they need to be trained. It takes x number of weeks to become productive in our warehouse. It takes x plus even more to become productive as a driver. And as you know, it takes time to become productive as a sales associate as well. So we're building those training durations of time into our staffing model, John. And when we say invest in advance of the recovery, what I'm specifically referring to is the training window. If it takes x weeks to get productive, we need to hire that person x weeks before they're needed. And then we have a week by week by week expectation of what we anticipate the volume recovery will be to tie to that staffing plan. 
If the volume recovery doesn't materialize the way that we anticipate, we will slow down. If the volume recovery is faster than what we anticipate, then we'll speed up. The good news is we have the financial capability to do both of those two things. 
And then, John, your second part of your question was on pricing. As always, it's a good one. But that will be a staggered rollout. So we're in our first region right now. We're not going to go from 1 region pilot to a national rollout. We learned a lot at Sysco over the years on how to roll out new tools, new software, change management and the like. The good news is that this pricing software is being warmly embraced by our sales consultants. It takes a significant component of work off their plate, time that they can then reinvest back into their customers, as I said in my prepared remarks. And I just want to be really crystal clear about something, we will not be reducing sales consultants because of our pricing tool because time is freed up for them. It's the opposite. We will take that time that gets freed up on their work week and invest it back into our customers. And John, we're optimistic that, that will help from a sales growth perspective as well. So we're going to do our regional pilot that we're currently in. We will expand to 4 additional regions in this Q3 period. And then we will read and react based on the business results, the change management learnings. And then John, we will determine the pace with which we will bring it to the rest of the country. And I don't have a declarative end date for that project because I want the success of the project and the change management learnings to determine the speed and pace with which we go. 
John, I'll toss it back to you if you have any follow-up."

Here's the behavior change that drove it. And it's really clear, we changed their compensation. In the prior compensation model, they were paid more on increase the profitability of an existing customer than they were on win new bus",514,"Lauren, good question. Here's the behavior change that drove it. And it's really clear, we changed their compensation. In the prior compensation model, they were paid more on increase the profitability of an existing customer than they were on win new business. That's what I meant earlier when I said we had a disincentive in our system. That was never our intention. We didn't want for them to not be out prospecting. But if they had an hour to spend, they were going to spend that hour on increasing the profitability of an existing customer, and they weren't going to spend it on prospecting. 
In our new compensation model, which is the base plus bonus, the bonus metrics are configurable. We can make them whatever we want them to be. In fact, we can change them quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month on what matters, and we've been doing exactly that. So now we have a better balance between improving penetration of lines with existing customers, which is a profit driver, and it's super important, and we need to better balance it with new customer prospecting. So the biggest reason for our improvement in our performance, Lauren, and new customer growth is a behavior change. 
Our associates are spending much more time with new customer prospecting than they were previously. And the point you made, which was now how do you retain these customers is paramount. Partly, it's the reason why we're investing in service, why we're investing in no order minimums, why we're investing in not cutting back on delivery frequency. Things like that matter. I don't think I've talked about this yet. We're also investing in payment plans so that we can help our customers with their credit balances through this difficult period of time and not cutting them off because they're having some challenges. We negotiate with each customer one by one, using a predictive model on risk for that customer, and we're helping them. We're helping them make payment plans spread out, smooth out so that they can stay with us. And it will be imperative, Lauren, to do what you said, which is we need to retain these new wins. We need to work on things like Sysco brand penetration for these new wins to increase the profit rate of each of them. We need to add more lines and that's where our new selling model comes in, and this is the last thing I'll say. 
We need to penetrate other additional categories. They could be buying dry and frozen from us, and they've never considered a broadliner for fresh produce. Guess what, we have one of the best fresh produce businesses in the United States. We turn that inventory on a weekly basis, and we can penetrate produce if we introduce the right salesperson to that customer. So those are the activities: win the new customer through improved prospecting, once that customer has been won, penetrate Sysco lines, increase additional categories, provide them with tremendous service, and retention will meet or beat expectations. 
Lauren, back to you, if you have a follow-up."

I'll start, and then, at the end, I'll toss it over to Aaron for color commentary in addition to what I covered. So international margin, we called it out. I mean, it was a difficult quarter from an international perspective. There's 2 reasons why. One is the customer mix. Just to be very clear, restaurants are closed in France, in the U.K. and in Ireland. They're closed. Unlike in the United States, where on-prem dining is allowed and delivery and takeout and drive-thrus are robust. Our most profitable customer segment in Europe is closed. They can do takeout and delivery, but takeout and delivery are much, much less activated than they are in the United States. And we anticipate they will be closed until April. So we've got a meaningful headwind in that regard. 
I'm going to weave in here, though, a point you made about long term. I just want to remind everybody that rate before COVID wave 2, the best business in our entire book of business was in France. We were minus 5% in France, right before the challenges of this secondary lockdown. So we fully anticipate that the international business will respond just as fast, if not even faster than the United States, once these lockdowns are eased. And again, it's frustrating to us that we think that they're talking Easter, but we can focus on what we can control. So the margin percent is mostly driven by customer penetration mix we did have some inventory spoilage challenges, Kelly. It's appropriate to call it out. Our business results in Q2 that will think about it from this perspective, France goes from minus 5 to minus 55 in a week. We have fresh inventory. There's challenges when that happens. And the pace and speed with which Europe went into lockdown was significant. 
Similar to what happened, if you remember back in Q4, you remember my narrative, Kelly, from back in Q4, here's what I said, ""Europe entered the lockdown earlier and swifter and came out later and slower."" And I anticipate that same thing is going to happen with this second wave, but we have full expectations that it will come out strong. It's just going to take longer. 
Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you if there's anything you would like to add or if I missed anything."

First, Kelly, as we all know, what's really important is dollars in the bank, gross profit dollars in the bank. And so our first objective with Europe is just to get the business back up and running and contributing to the bottom line. 
Kevin did an excellent job of covering 2 of the primary drivers on the rate impact of international, but I do want to -- and we talked about the customers being closed on the inventory obsolescence, but I do want to call out 2 additional elements. One is product mix shift, where across our international operations, on-premises dining is not available, but takeouts or takeaway is, right? We do have a product mix shift into products in support of that is lower margin. 
And then lastly, and perhaps the most materially, we have some business mix shift going on where with France closed and other operations in Europe constrained, we've actually mixed into our Canadian contract business, which is lower margin for -- within the international segment, you're seeing then some of the numbers."

The majority of our transformation is at the local level because that's where the profit is the highest. It's where we have the greatest opportunity to profitably grow, and it's where our new business operating model will have the greatest dividend, and we'll be clear about that on the vectors of growth, how each of these transformation initiatives drives improved business performance. 
At the national level, to oversimplify, the reason we're doing so well with new business capture is these large national customers are looking for a distributor that they have confidence in, that they believe in that can shift and this is simple, I know this, on time and in full and be able to stock the inventory that they need to be able to deliver for their thousands of locations. They have tremendous confidence that Sysco is that partner. And we have been very successful in the contract bids this summer and into this fall. And Kelly, 1 reason why we've been able to be more successful there is we put focus on it. We use this expression, fish where the fish are. We can see the restaurant ticket data from all the banks and the credit cards, seeing how well QSR is doing. And we needed to win where the growth was happening. And we have the capacity to do it, Kelly, because our overall business volume is down. 
And as our business volume recovers, you might be thinking, ""Well, Kevin, what's that going to do to your storage and throughput capacity?"" We're working aggressively on that. And there are several things that we can do to make more room in our warehouses for this incremental volume so that it is flowing due to the bottom line, like Aaron said, the way we need it to. SKU rationalization between sites, slower-moving inventory being pulled out of forward-facing locations, et cetera. These are things we can do to improve the throughput of our warehouses to allow us to be able to support this substantial business win that we've had, $1.5 billion net since the beginning of this crisis. 
So it is as simple as they trust us, we can do the business at a national level, and that business is available for us from a winning perspective. What we need to do is make sure it's a sufficiently profitable business for us, and here's my commitment to all of our investors. We will not bid on business that isn't profitable for our company, and we have been very, very disciplined in the contracts that we've underwritten since the beginning of this crisis."

I think it would be fair to say the following the hardest restricted markets. So the urban areas are where the closure rate is higher than the places that have fewer restrictions, which would be the southern 1/3 of the United States and more rural geographies. So I think that would be a fair thing to communicate, and it's obvious, right? Where the restrictions are the greatest, that's where the closures are the highest. John, we're not seeing any specific cuisine type having a higher rate of closure. 
And again, on the closure side, is it temporary? Is it permanent? What I've been pretty consistent in the beginning of this crisis to communicate is we believe there will be an elevation in churn over this tumultuous period. But from an overall bankruptcy rate perspective or the number of doors in the market 2 years from now, I don't believe it's going to be meaningfully different than the number we have now. There'll be an elevation in churn, but there's not going to be a substantial, substantial reduction in customer doors. I know that select agencies have come out and said bold statistics like 30% to 40% bankruptcies. It's just not what we see. It's not what we see in our data. And as I've said before, if a person owns their family restaurant, and this is what they've done for 25 years, they're not going to close and become a plumber. They may have to temporary close. They may have to close that business to restructure their debt and guess what, they're probably going to reopen a restaurant at some point in time. 
So we believe the independent restaurant customers are fighters, as I said in my prepared remarks, and they're doing a terrific job in light of the conditions that they're dealing with to stay in business, and we're proud of the work that we're doing.

I'll say a couple of comments on international and Aaron, I'm going to toss to you if there's anything you want to add to the international part of that question. Your question, John, on",692,"Okay, John, thank you. Two-part question, I'll do the first part. I'll say a couple of comments on international and Aaron, I'm going to toss to you if there's anything you want to add to the international part of that question. 
Your question, John, on the first part was metro markets where I've told you previously, we underindex as a percent of our total. In fact, it was a year ago today that I told you that, that was going to be a big focus of our company that we could win in the metro markets. And John, that still exists. That is still absolutely an opportunity for this company. I put that project on pause given places like New York and Chicago and LA are closed for business, figure of speech only. And it wouldn't have been a prudent time for us to do that. We have a couple of pilots going. We can talk more about this in May. This is one of our vectors of growth is to improve our performance in those metro markets. We have a very significant financial opportunity when we close the gap at those metro markets to our national total from a sales and profit growth perspective. 
And it's more, John, of a supply chain opportunity than it is anything else. We need to deliver more frequently to those customers. We need to do same day, next-day delivery to those customers. As you know, they've got these tiny backrooms. They can't have big bulk storage. They need produce delivered on a daily basis. And we've got the capability of doing that. I don't want to help the cat out of the bag, but we've got a couple of pilots undergoing that are showing promise and you're going to see more from Sysco in that capability. 
The more insightful part of your question was like, so when is the right time? And I heard you loud and clear, and we're working on that. I don't have anything declarative to say today on the when, other than we have the ability to invest when we see an activity that will be promising for us, and that will be an area where Sysco improves our capabilities, and we fully expect to be able to win profitable business. The good thing about that business is, as you know, it has a higher profit percentage than other customer types. So it's a pretty attractive market for us. 
On the international side, I haven't talked as much about the new customer wins in international because that business is, right now, doing poorly in aggregate versus the rest of our business because, as Aaron said, the fixed cost deleverage and the overall sales being down. But just in the last quarter, not included actually in the $200 million that I quoted, we have a notable win with a very large customer in Europe, excuse me, in the U.K. We have a notable win in Sweden. We have a notable win in Ireland. John, we're starting to make traction on new customer wins of substance. And what we need to do, in addition to that, though, is win at the local level. And that's been challenging during this crisis because most of our customers in places like Paris actually closed. The government schemes are so robust in France that it's actually more profitable for the restaurant in France to actually temporarily close than to stay open, so it's pretty hard to win new customers when the customers we're trying to serve are closed. But we're going to go after it hard when those markets reopen. A combination of wins at the national level and then incremental wins at the local level. 
A question I was asked 10 minutes ago on can you bring some of these U.S. best practices across the pond, and we fully intend to do that. 
Aaron, I'll throw it to you for final word. And then I have one comment I want to make about our Q3 trends that I didn't get a chance to cover yet to close out the call. So Aaron, over to you, please."

And from what I can see in early days is we have real pockets of strength in Canada, the U.K., Sweden and Ireland and parts of Latin America. But we also have some opportunities to improve, and the team is working hard against those, notwithstanding COVID crisis. 
I'm still going to know the teams in the businesses. It would be unfair for me to comment on any one part of the business. But  one commitment I can make is that our management team will regularly assess the portfolio, and where we need to, we'll take some action. And you saw us do that recently, most recently in Spain when we divested the Davigel business. So I'm excited to get to know the business better. And as I said, we have every right to win internationally as well."

We appreciate everyone's patience and staying on path to the top of the hour. Thank you for that. Thank you for your interest in Sysco. 
And I just want to leave you with 1 statement of optimism. I know we talked about December being a really tough month for us and that the quarter had sequentially been decelerating. We're seeing the opposite in Q3, which is a good thing. Our January month, which just closed, performed better than December. And we are seeing sequential improvement in our business trends. 
I'm even more optimistic into these forward-facing months as those restrictions that are placed upon our customers ease. And it's all going to be tied to the progress that we make in vaccine administration. I think you all know I worked in health care for 8 years before I came here. The news is giving a doomsday scenario on vaccine administration, it's going better than the news is covering it. And what happens next is vaccines are going to begin to be distributed in places like Walmart and Walgreens and CVS. And when we can get 40,000 places in this country administering vaccines and can make meaningful progress on fighting this COVID crisis, we're going to see governments be much more willing to ease restrictions. And even places like U.K., where we're in complete lockdown, U.K. as a country is doing a terrific job with vaccine administration, and that's going to provide an opportunity for a business recovery in calendar 2021, and we're poised and ready to take advantage of it.

I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. 
During this morning's call, I will spend time discussing Sysco's recent performance. I will provide an update on our business transformation, and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery. I'll then turn it over to Aaron, who will discuss Sysco's second quarter fiscal results. 
As we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption. We have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity and business investments. To that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our company for long-term success. I am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track, and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors. 
The COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food-away-from-home sector and has disrupted our marketplace. In light of those realities, we are pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021. And for the second quarter, we performed generally in line with our expectations adjusted for the environment. 
While our second quarter financial results were down compared to prior year, we delivered a profitable quarter despite 23% decline in our top line sales and funded investments to enable our transformation. 
Our customers experienced increasingly restrictive conditions on their operations during the second quarter, which were most notable in December when restaurant traffic and sales declined. Additionally, our international segment has been hard hit due to tougher restrictions in the countries in which we operate. At Sysco, we are not taking the restrictions on customers as a gravity issue. We are doing more than ever before to help our customers navigate this challenging environment. 
I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we are having in winning new business. We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021. Those investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter, and Aaron will speak more to this in a moment. Examples of investments during the second quarter include investments in our customers, in our people, in our working capital and in our technology. I'd like to highlight some examples of each of these purposeful choices. 
Investments in our customers, including our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which makes it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. A visual representation of our Restaurants Rising campaign can be found on Page 6 of our presentation. 
Most notably, we announced in November that we are eliminating minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, which provides operators significant flexibility in managing their business and makes it easier to order what they need when they need it. In addition, we are not eliminating delivery service days during the second wave of COVID, a practice we know select competition is currently doing. We see the light at the end of the tunnel. And as such, we are prioritizing customer service. A little incremental expense right now is a small price to pay for customer loyalty and partnership. 
Our sales consultants are leveraging the Restaurants Rising program to retain current customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones. In addition to the no-order-minimums commitment, Sysco sales consultants are assisting their customers with setting up touchless menus, optimizing delivery and takeout operations and helping with marketing programs to create awareness of our customers' operations, just to name a few of our value-added services. I am proud to report that our Net Promoter Score increased by more than 1,000 basis points in the quarter due, in large part, to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurants Rising program. The NPS increase was our largest quarterly increase in our company's history. 
Importantly, as you can see on Page 7 in our slides, the incremental closure rate of Sysco's customers is 50% below the industry average. And lastly, we onboarded more new local customers in Q2 than in any single quarter in the last 5 years. 
In addition to investing in our customers, we are making investments in our people. We are intentionally retaining drivers despite a volume decline in December to ensure we have them available for our pending volume recovery. Drivers are in short supply across the country. And while this investment will drive some incremental transportation expense in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery. As you know, we made changes to our sales organization and sales compensation during the summer. Our associate retention has improved compared to historical retention rates and our improved retention will help with sales productivity metrics in the future. 
We are beginning to make investments in working capital to position the right products in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery. Sysco has the broadest inventory assortment in the industry. Our ability to ship products on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry. We have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and in inventory, while other foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters. We are also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity. 
Lastly, we are making strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. This includes our Sysco Shop technology, our new pricing software and improvements we are making in our supply chain systems. 
Sysco's ability to invest in our customers, our people, our inventory and our technology, while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic, is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our leadership team.
I'd like to turn now to providing an update on our business transformation. First, as we have shared previously, we are focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customers' experience with Sysco and drive incremental sales. Priority number one is improving our mobile ordering platform, Sysco Shop. Notably, we are now onboarding new customers in less than 24 hours, a step-change improvement. The number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continues to meaningfully increase throughout the quarter. Additionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region. We are learning a lot through this regional pilot, and we remain on track to roll out the pricing system across the country. The goal of this effort is to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive incremental sales and gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level. Additionally, by automating customer-level pricing, we will free up time for our valued sales consultants to spend with customers on value-added activities, such as menu design, Sysco brand penetration and other drivers of sales and margin.
Second, we are improving our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process. Through our sales transformation, we have an improved more customer-centric organizational structure. Our sales transformation is progressing well, and the team-based selling approach is gaining traction. We have created and filled new specialist selling positions. We have implemented a sales quarterback position that helps guide the collective sales teams across a given geography.
As I mentioned on our last call, we have launched our first cuisine segment go-to-market selling strategy, and we are seeing initial signs of success with that customer segment through incremental market share gains. We will roll out this program to additional cuisine segments in calendar 2021.
Lastly, Sysco completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the start of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that our new regional presidents are in place and are finding quick wins to improve our business. The average tenure of our market and regional leaders is over 20 years, and these experienced and talented leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco. Examples of quick wins include optimizing our inventory assortment across multiple physical sites and optimizing the servicing of key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location services each customer location. 
To be a great company, you need to have a world-class leadership team. I am pleased that during the quarter, we made important progress in strengthening our leadership team. Aaron Alt joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer. Aaron is with us today, and you'll be hearing from him next. Aaron is a proven finance leader with over 20 years of experience in foodservice and retail leadership positions. He has a track record of transformation and a value creation at large organizations in multiple industries. 
Additionally, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Tom has experienced leading enterprise information technology strategy, services, operations, risk and cybersecurity from large global enterprises. In his most recent role, he worked for a global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly applicable to the transformational journey at Sysco.
Additionally, Tim Ørting has officially started his position, leading our international division. Tim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies. With Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce the number of my direct reports by 4 which allows me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the strategy development and execution of the company.
Joel Grade has begun his new role, leading business development and is actively engaged in identifying new sources of growth for Sysco. I am pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete. We have a strong management team that balances Sysco and foodservice industry expertise with best-in-class experience from other industries. Our new leaders join a talented and an experienced Sysco leadership team.
Greg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business, has over 35 years of industry experience in 30 years specific with Sysco. Greg's expertise and steady hand in running our largest business during the COVID disruption has been invaluable. I appreciate his leadership and the strong impact he has on our results.
Great leadership teams work as a team on a common agenda. Our transformation strategy has galvanized this leadership team around a common purpose, and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for foodservice distribution for many years to come.
I report to you today with strong confidence that a pending business recovery sits before us. As vaccine administration makes progress across the globe, the restrictions currently placed upon our customers will begin to ease. We can see in our performance data that once those restrictions ease, consumers are ready and willing to eat away from home. 
At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other foodservice distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers, and our customer success will generate business growth for Sysco.
In closing, I'd like to give a sincere thank you to all Sysco associates who are working hard to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. Our industry-leading sales force has been inspired by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than any point in our proud history. Our warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working hard every day to ensure we ship to our customers what they want, when they need it. I am proud of their dedication during this challenging operating time. 
I also want to thank our customers for their resilience, the grit that they have shown and the fight that they have displayed during this pandemic. At Sysco, our customers are an inspiration to us, and we will show them just as much determination and how we serve them.
I will now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our second quarter results, along with additional financial details. Aaron, welcome to Sysco, and over to you."
189096,701606738,2188692,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I am really excited to be at Sysco. Before I joined Sysco, what I could see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. Now tha",1640,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I am really excited to be at Sysco. Before I joined Sysco, what I could see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. Now that I'm on the inside, I see all of that, in addition to a driven leadership team, relentlessly focused on being ready for the business recovery and on driving a customer and capability-led transformation. In short, I see many opportunities in front of us to create shareholder value.
I will start today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow. Second quarter sales were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year but flat to the prior quarter. Sales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November as restrictions eased, but new lockdown restrictions during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the international segment.
Here are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased to 19.7%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%. We do know that there is keen interest in the continued impact of COVID. The answer varies by region. Europe went into lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a significant portion of the second half. However, since the week after the holidays, we have been seeing signs of life from volume improvements in our USFS business, and SYGMA continues to grow. This panel will be fought week by week, region by region for the next couple of quarters until the vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold. The only commitment we can make is that we will be ready and more competitive than ever.
As we move down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points as our rate came in at 18.2%. 
A couple of thoughts on that. First, we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter as we did this year. Second, our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, and its partner segment, SYGMA, each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-COVID quarter, which is frankly remarkable given the market dynamics. 
Given the growth of our national accounts business at SYGMA, which is lower margin, we did see business mix shift, which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change. Our enterprise margin was also impacted by the international and other businesses as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed. 
Our expense profile changed over the course of our second quarter as adjusted operating expense decreased 15.3% to $1.9 billion. This expense profile reflects the deleverage of our cost structure as sales remained down 0.3%. These results arise from some purposeful choices. First, and on the positive side of the equation, we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network. We also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant swings in case volume.
Second, we continue to make excellent progress against our $350 million of cost-savings initiatives in fiscal 2021. I can see the savings in the detailed income statement, and we continue to identify and pursue more opportunities. 
Third, but on the other side of the equation, we have made the purposeful choice to leverage our financial strength to prepare for the business recovery before it happens. As previously announced, we changed our sales consultant compensation to include both a fixed and variable component to drive retention and focus on key operational metrics. We can see that change working in our market wins. 
Additionally, we brought back hundreds of associates in the second quarter in support of our business model. In the third quarter, and indeed the back half, we anticipate we will hire thousands of additional sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts and operations associates in anticipation of the pending business recovery. We plan to be ahead of the recovery curve, not catching up, and we have the financial resources to do just that. 
Finally, as Kevin mentioned, we continue to make purposeful investments in our capability builds in support of our transformation: pricing, customer experience, sales, vendor management and personalization. While we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters, the investment dollars are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter, and we'll do so in the back half. When combined with the impact of slower openings in our international segment, we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than originally anticipated. However, as volume returns and grows, whether due to market recovery or our purposeful investments, we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and expect that, over the next several quarters, the impact of the cost-savings efforts separate from the ongoing investments will be more visible. 
Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 63% to $234 million. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.8% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 80% to $0.17 for the quarter.
 
Now let's turn to our second quarter results by business segment, starting with the U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 23.9% versus the prior year period. Notwithstanding the difficult environment, the business acquired a record number of new customers as our sales teams hit the streets and we deployed digital tools. We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased 165 basis points to 36.5% for total U.S. cases driven by the customer and product mix shift. 
With respect to local U.S. cases, Sysco brand sales decreased 455 basis points to 42%, which was driven by product mix shift into prepackaged and takeaway-ready products. Gross profit decreased 24% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. Though as I called out earlier, gross margin was flat for the quarter at 19.7% as the business very successfully managed through the puts and takes of the COVID environment and addressed headwinds, such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shift out of higher-margin categories like PP&E. The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 18.9% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income decreased 33% to $472 million. 
Moving on to the SYGMA segment. Sales increased 4% to $1.5 billion compared to the prior year period,driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurant servicing drive-thru traffic. This is the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment. We continue to see new business wins in the SYGMA segment and are pleased by the overall improvement. Gross profit increased 4.1% to $129 million for the quarter, and gross margin was flat to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4%, $118 million, and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $11 million. 
Moving to the international segment. Our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses have been substantially impacted by recent shutdowns which are more aggressive than lockdowns in the U.S. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $2 billion, a decrease of 32%, while gross profit decreased 36.2% and  gross margin decreased 128 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of adverse market mix, customer mix, product mix and aged inventory. For the international segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 16%, and adjusted operating income decreased 175% for an operating loss of $55 million.
Our other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. However, the business is in better shape than many of its competitors and has achieved a number of recent customer wins, including being named the preferred distributor for Renaissance Hotels, JW Marriott and Westin hotels via a new contract with Avendra in both the U.S. and Canada and being given access to all Marriott properties in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. 
While still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment, the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was $788 million year-to-date, which is in line with our previously noted guidance. Net CapEx for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $148 million, which was $235 million lower than last year as the company carefully assessed its capital investment choices in the face of COVID.
Sysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective. At quarter end, we had balance sheet cash of $5.8 billion, plus access to $2 billion of available borrowing capacity for a total of $7.8 billion. Our cash and available liquidity ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company. We continue to monitor our operating environment carefully. And as we assess reopening time lines and investment needs consistent with the transformation, we will be updating our views of our levels of cash and capital structure opportunities in future calls. 
Although this is a tough operating environment for our customers which will impact our results for the next quarter or 2, Sysco remains resolutely focused on managing its businesses, aggressively preparing for the business recovery,and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. We believe our strategy and our transformational initiatives will drive future value for our associates, shareholders and customers.

I would actually say from a transformation perspective, we're ahead of schedule. I've said this many, many times in our company town hall meetings and then private conversations with investors. While the COVID crisis has obviously been tremendously difficult on the customers that we serve, in our environment overall, the silver lining in that dark cloud is we've used it as an opportunity to accelerate our transformation. 
I've mentioned before our regionalization program. We had a plan to complete that over 2 years, and it's now done, as you heard me say on our prepared remarks on today's call. So our ability to accelerate change management, the buy-in from our experienced team on the impetus for change, meaningfully improved. And so when you look at our selling model, our leadership model, our technology tools, I would say we're ahead of the schedule on those activities, and I'm pleased with where we are, and we're very confident that these transformation initiatives are going to enable our company to be very successful. What we need, obviously, is the overall business environment to improve for all of those activities to be more visible in our results than they currently are. But we can see the internal data, and it's promising. 
Alex, the last thing I would just say is team. To have a great company, you need to have a great team, and I said it in my prepared remarks. We have a really strong team now that we've built at Sysco, which is a combination of extremely experienced leaders like Greg Bertrand, who runs our, by far, largest business, and new leaders that have joined our company that can help bring best practices from other industries, and frankly, key capabilities that we need at our company, like Judy, who's joined us as our Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Peck, who's joined us from a technology perspective; and then obviously, Aaron, who you heard from today, who is just a really terrific talented financial executive and transformation executive to help accelerate our results.
So in summary, Alex, I would say, I think we're ahead of schedule. And looking forward, like all of you are, to have COVID behind us, so we can prove it in our outcomes."

And we understand that this is a difficult quarter to model and a difficult year to model. We also have respect and empathy to the fact that we haven't given guidance this year, and the reason, obviously, is because it's choppy, and the recovery is not linear. So we're going to do the best we can to give you color commentary on where we are, what we're seeing. And Aaron will provide that in a moment for Q3. 
As it relates to what we're investing in, if you put it into 2 buckets, we have some key initiatives that we are investing in, which is the building of capabilities and, in many instances, technology that will advance our ability to be a better company in the future, and that's our pricing project. We're building a customer personalization engine to improve the type of offers that we provide to our customers using machine learning and predictive analytics to help our sales force be more effective. We're going to talk with you more about that at an Investor Day that we plan on holding in May. Neil will send out more details on that Investor Day. We know we owe you more specifics on our transformation, the size of that price, and we will cover those details with you at that May Investor Day. 
As it relates to the other half of the ""investments"", we do see a pending business recovery. We see a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not a train coming towards us. It's the dawning of a new more promising day. We can see it in our data.
Here are the facts behind what happens. As soon as restaurant restrictions are eased, our business immediately pops. And how do we know that? We know that because states like Florida and Texas, with limited restrictions, our business is substantially better than our national average. We can see it in states like California, which just allowed for, at the state level, the reopening of outdoor dining, which is important in a state that has quality weather. And the state of New York has now begun the easing of restrictions with New York City reporting this week that Valentine's Day in-restaurant dining will be authorized again. So we see immediate jumps in our business when that happens.
The reason you're hearing some tempering of enthusiasm from us specific to Q3 is we have an international business that is under severe lockdown. You probably all know this, but I just want to be really clear about this. In international, specifically Europe, restaurants are closed. Europe is currently in operating conditions that are similar to what the United States was experiencing back in April and May. In London, for instance, you can only leave your house for an hour a day. You can only go to the grocery store, to the park, and you need to stay within 5 kilometers of your home. I mean it's that locked down. And they don't have drive-thrus to the degree that we have them in the United States. 
So in the Europe business, our sales have been significantly impacted. Most notably, the European governments have come out and said that they don't anticipate easing those restrictions until roughly Easter. So we're going to be really careful and thoughtful in Europe. We will move at a slower pace in Europe, and we will meter our investments in that business tied to that business's recovery. 
But in the United States, we believe that the progress that's being made in vaccination is substantial. The at-risk population being protected now moving on to category 1b, 1c, and eventually categories 2 and 3. As vaccines make progress, as the death rate comes down, as ICU bed capacity improves, that will give governors the confidence to ease restrictions. And when that happens, our business immediately pops. 
So we need to do things in preparation for that, and that's what Aaron is referring to. We need to get inventory back into our facilities. We need to staff up in both warehouse and in driver positions to ensure that when our customers are ready to place orders, we're not putting out a job req and trying to fill a job and then the time delay that comes along with that. So we have the financial strength to do that. It's a purposeful choice.
And I'll just leave you, Ed, with this last comment, then I'm going to toss it to Aaron. And choices in service right now, we had to cut delivery frequency back in what is our period of April, May and June of last fiscal year. We've purposely chosen not to do that this time. We are servicing our customers 6-plus days a week. We're not cutting delivery frequency. We waived order minimums. All of these things are to help our customers during their difficult COVID wave 2. And that's a choice we made. We believe that's a choice that will pay itself forward with loyalty and future growth. And that 1,000 basis points of NPS improvement that I covered in my prepared remarks, that is a notable, notable reflection. And those that understand NPS understand that, that is a pay-it-forward metric that will benefit our company into the future. So Aaron, I'll toss it over to you specific to Q3, if there's anything you wanted to add to that."

We don't provide quarterly guidance per se, but what I'd like to do is take a moment and give you some context on Q3 by talking a bit more about Q2 and what we saw there. I believe there are some parallels. As you will have observed from our release and from the comments, we experienced deleveraging during the second quarter as sales dropped 23% from prior year.
And you will recall from prior earnings calls that Joel had previously observed that our cost structure is approximately 1/3, 2/3 split between fixed and variable costs. You can do the math on what that should mean for the quarter versus our prior year. 
I would comment that we benefited extensively from efficiency efforts. I called out some of them during the call. And specific identified and executed cost savings during the quarter, the quarterly component of the $350 million that the team has been talking about for the last couple of quarters. 
I commented during the results that we could see the savings in the P&L. And let me give you a couple of examples of that. People, overall, across the enterprise, we have 15,100 fewer employees today than we did a year ago, and that includes a significant cut at our corporate headquarters as well. We've identified and executed specific COGS, cost savings that I can see in the P&L. We've rationalized our technology investments to be more forward focused. We've identified indirect cost savings, professional costs, et cetera. So what I want you to take away is the cost savings are real. And while we haven't disclosed the exact level of what it is quarter-to-quarter, it's material, and they're out there.
Now the cost savings are important because they offset a combination of 2 things going on, and I would have you think about it as really, call it, a 50-50 spread. The first is, as Kevin just talked about, we did make incremental investments against both the business recovery and the transformation in the quarter. We purposely used some of our savings from those cost-savings; initiatives to fund the investments against the short-term recovery and the long-term transformation. And then there was a mix of other onetime expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging that we experienced, and those probably are getting low as going on in Europe and other parts of our network. 
To summarize, we do believe that some incremental expense now is worth it. It gets us ready for  the recovery to come. Some of the investments and costs that I called out earlier will continue into the back half, particularly into Q3. We want to be transparent about that. But importantly, as we get into the true end of the year and into next year, those same savings, they're structural. They're recurring. They're real, and they will become much more apparent as we reverse the sales decline and get the early investments and the recovery and the transformation behind us."

Just -- it's both end on the strength of the stronger players, right? ] Strength gets stronger during times of diversity and crisis. And what Aaron was just referring to is the $350 million of cost takeout is real. It's concrete, and we can track it. And as our volume gets back to pre-COVID levels, and it will, that's going to flow straight to the bottom line. The reason it's less visible now is because we have all these other things happening vis-à-vis investments in the recovery, investments in new capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. But that $350 million is hard, real, and it will be visible as our volume recovers. So -- and we're not done. We've said that before, too. We are not done with structural cost improvement. There's more to be attained. And again, that's something we can talk about more at our May Investor Day.
Specific on the revenue side, the number we've quoted explicitly is the national sales win. It's impressive. It's material, $1.5 billion of net new wins in the national sales segment. You can see it in our performance results in SYGMA. And also, you can see it in our performance results and just our general overall case growth. 
But what we haven't explicitly quantified for you because it's challenging with what's happening in the marketplace is the wins we're having at the local level. In my prepared remarks, I said the following: We won more new customers at the independent local level in Q2 than at any point in time over the last 5 years. That's as concrete and as specific as I can be, and it's real. We can track it. We use a tool called Sysco 360 to track every customer activity. Those wins are going to be visible, again, as our volume recovers. 
The reason it's less visible on top line growth is because the average order per customer is currently down because of COVID. In a takeout and delivery world, customers order fewer appetizers, fewer desserts. They tend -- they focus more on that main entrée. And so the average volume per customer is down, but we've added a substantial number of new customers. And that's not just in the U.S. That applies to Canada. That applies to all of our businesses in Europe as well. So that will be a pay-it-forward activity. And what we anticipate we will be able to show you at our May Investor Day is what is the size of the prize of all of these activities worth, the trajectory that we are on from a sales growth perspective and then these key enabling transformational elements, what they're worth from a market share capture perspective and then how that flows through to the bottom line. 
Before we go to your follow-up, I'll just ask Aaron if there's anything he wants to add to what I just said."

I can, however, put a little more color on the examples that I was just providing. And I also realize that the second half of your first question, which was tied to the smaller competitors, how are they performing, I didn't sufficiently answer that on the first question. 
There's no doubt that the bigger players are getting stronger. I have been asked directly before, Kevin, ""How is it true that each of the major players are reporting that they are winning market share?"" Well, it is true. That is what is happening, and what that mathematically implies is that smaller players are currently donating share, most likely because they don't have the ability to invest in inventory during a period of volume growth. We know for a fact that select competitors are cutting delivery frequency. They cut Saturday first. They cut Wednesday second. We have not done that, Jeff. So we have not canceled Saturday. We have not canceled Wednesday. In fact, as you well know, we eliminated order minimums. We are seeing improvement in our trends for the customers that we serve as those programs have been launched, which is Restaurants Rising, and we are seeing retention of customers because we're not cutting back on service.
A data point that I've quoted before is for those customers that have joined us on this Restaurants Rising campaign, leveraging our menu services, leveraging our ability to help them with takeout and delivery, they are performing 20%, on average, better than the customers that choose not to engage. Our priority, obviously, is to get more and more and more of them engaged, and we're working on that. 
The second one, I'd just take you to Page 7 in our deck. And that is the closure rate of Sysco customers. So this chart has been normalized to -- a normal year would be at 0, and our closure rate of our customers is 50% lower than the national average. And this data doesn't come from our internal systems. This data comes from Yelp. 
So as I put, 1,000 basis points improvement in NPS, we've won more new customers in this quarter than in 5-plus years. When I put the closure rate of our customers, it's 50% less than the industry average and that we can see market share gains. These things give you confidence that Sysco will be a net winner in the business. And when you layer on the future periods where others are going to meaningfully struggle, Joel made this point many different times, others are going to really struggle with building inventory in advance of the sales actually hitting their business because that's a period of balance sheet stress. We have the capability because the strength of our balance sheet to build inventory in advance of the customer ordering, Jeff, that's a big deal."

We have not disclosed the build rate of the $350 million plus of synergies or cost savings that we are identifying as we carry forward. But as you're trying to model, what I would encourage you to do is to look at or reflect on my comment that approximately 50% of what we saw in the quarter was our investments against the transformation and against the business recovery, and 50% was onetime expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging in parts of the portfolio. That's interesting. 
But the really important point is that, look, the onetime costs, they are onetime and will go away. And any fixed cost deleveraging, as the tide rises with sales, that will also disappear. And the investments against the recovery and the investments against the transformation, while they may occur for a couple of quarters, they are also transitory in nature. And we will have the -- we'll have the benefit of achieving the run rate savings that Joel had called out previously in future quarters. This -- our situation has evolved.

So this question might sound challenging. It's literally not meant to be, but I mean you forced turnover, right? And where would anyone else go? So I mean, indeed, retention, by definition, always has to improve. So I was wondering if -- are people making more or less? Are you offering more benefits? What kind of feedback? And is that the correlation to Net Promoter scores? If it is, as Net Promoter Scores go up, what happens then? I mean I know it's sales, but could you tie that, for example, to wallet share, of independence, which is 30% versus 40% change? Did local independent wallet share go up?

It's -- the spirit of your question is excellent, and I appreciate you're asking it. I'm going to unpack it in 2 ways. One is NPS is our customers' voice to us, and we have a large sample size. We track it real time, and we take action on it. And we see, in our NPS data, where we have strength. The by far biggest strength of Sysco is our sales consultants. We massively over index our competitors in the quality and support given to our customers through that audience. By far, our biggest strength is our sales consultants. Such a strength, we will continue to leverage, and I'm going to get to that in a minute when I talk about what I meant by associate retention. 
So we need to continue to harness, in fact, further leverage our biggest strength. And Nicole, what we need to do on NPS to make an overall improvement lift is address the pain points, right? So here are things we were hearing through this COVID crisis as a pain point. ""Kevin, my volume is down, but yet you have these order minimums. You're willing to come one time per week during this period of time when my volume is down because you cut Saturday delivery."" So we just leaned into it, and we addressed it hard. What we did is we ensured that this COVID wave 2, we were not going to cut delivery frequency. And the biggest pain point we heard was from our restaurant operators. ""I can't predict what my order volume is going to be, and I'm really worried about your minimum orders,"" and we eliminated that problem for them. We just took it off the table. From now through the end of this crisis, and it very well might be permanent, we are not asking for order minimums. We're here to ship what they need, when they need it, regardless of the order volume on the regularly scheduled delivery day, and we're not going to cut delivery frequency. 
So Nicole, here's what happened. The associate piece of that NPS survey got even higher because our sales consultants are leaning into helping restaurant operators with menu design and takeout and delivery and hooking them up with a delivery partner. And then the pain point of delivery, we meaningfully improved. If you put the 2 together, we saw 1,000 basis points lift.
What that will do for our business in the future is higher customer retention and higher share of wallet. If you study the NPS, there is a lag, right? So as you improve NPS meaningfully, it is in the forward-facing quarters and into years when that results in higher retention and higher share of wallet. It's not an immediate A then B. But we're confident that we're doing the right things in support of our customers, and they will reward us with business. 
What I referred to in my script, as it relates to associate retention, was tied to our sales consultant compensation change that we made this summer. Now why we made the sales compensation change was twofold. One, we had some disincentives in our old structure that motivated our sales consultants to do some things that were inconsistent with our company strategy, point one. Point two, we had too much turnover, especially in our newer associates. They were on a full commission previously. And they just simply, in those early years, couldn't earn enough when they were on full commission to make it through their learning curve as they built their business. 
In our new model, we have a base-plus-bonus structure where they make a livable wage off of their base, and then they have the opportunity to make a very healthy income through their bonus. That was implemented this summer. Change is hard when you implement a new tool like that. But statistically and significantly statistically -- excuse me, statistically significant, I meant to say, we are seeing improvements in retention, and it's not just because we reduced the number of people earlier in the year. It is because, actually, the folks that we're tracking that have been here before, during and after COVID, we're seeing retention at a higher rate attributable to that change in comp. 
But Nicole, I'll toss it back to you to see if there's any follow-up to anything I just said."

There's too much volatility in that type of metric to be that specific on a call. What I can definitely say, however, is that for the customers that have engaged with us on the Restaurants Rising campaign, yes. We win more share of wallet with them, and we retain them. There's a lot of churn in this industry. Many customers use multiple distributors, 2 or 3 distributors. There are reasons why they do that, and what we're seeing in the Restaurants Rising campaign and the work we're doing with our transformation is that a customer is less needing to have multiple distributors. 
I'll introduce one of our other strategic initiatives, which is our pricing initiative. The number one reason why a customer leaves Sysco to go to a competitor and vice versa, frankly, is because of price and specifically transparency for price. They think they can get a price somewhere else, so they want to keep their distributor honest by taking portions of their business and bringing it to a competitor. As we implement our pricing software,and we give customer item-specific pricing, pricing that's right at the item level, we believe that we will lose less individual lines to competitors tied to price. And frankly, the opposite will have the opportunity to win incremental cases with existing customers because we will be right on price for the items that matter, which will drive volume growth. And how to take margins neutral is on inelastic items that are on the tail of the inventory assortment, you can take some nominal increases on price to offset the margin dilution. 
All in, we're bullish on our ability to increase share of wallet. When we meet in May at our Investor Day, we'll be able to explain in more detail what we believe is possible from a share wallet growth perspective, but we have customers to answer your question specifically that are well north of 30% with Sysco."

That thousands apply to each of the things that were after what he said. He said sales associates, warehouse associates, drivers and support resources. So the thousands declarative applies to the cumulative of all of them, so we're not going to be hiring thousands of new sales associates. We will hire new sales associates. We're hiring new specialists. We're hiring national business developers -- I'm sorry, new business developers, NBD, is what we call them, to grow our business. But the majority of the thousands comment is actually in the warehouse and driver populations simply tied to the business volume recovery that we anticipate.
As Aaron quoted, we have 15,000 fewer people working for us today than we did pre-COVID. And we will and expect to get back to pre-COVID volume levels down the road, and we need to hire up to be able to staff up, to be able to support that business recovery.
I just want to be really clear. It's not, today, it's a 0., and tomorrow, it's thousands. It's a week-by-week staffing plan. And we will be able to throttle it up and throttle it down based upon what we see and our data, but they need to be trained. It takes x number of weeks to become productive in our warehouse. It takes x plus even more to become productive as a driver. And as you know, it takes time to become productive as a sales associate as well. So we're building those training durations of time into our staffing model, John. And when we say invest in advance of the recovery, what I'm specifically referring to is the training window. If it takes x weeks to get productive, we need to hire that person x weeks before they're needed. And then we have a week by week by week expectation of what we anticipate the volume recovery will be to tie to that staffing plan. If the volume recovery doesn't materialize the way that we anticipate, we will slow down. If the volume recovery is faster than what we anticipate, then we'll speed up. The good news is we have the financial capability to do both of those 2 things. 
And then, John, your second part of your question was on pricing. As always, it's a good one, but that will be a staggered rollout. So we're in our first region right now. We're not going to go from one region pilot to a national rollout. We learned a lot at Sysco over the years on how to roll out new tools, new software, change management and the like. The good news is that this pricing software is being warmly embraced by our sales consultants. It takes a significant component of work off their plate, time that they can then reinvest back into their customers, as I said in my prepared remarks. 
And I just want to be really crystal clear about something: We will not be reducing sales consultants because of our pricing tool because time is freed up for them. It's the opposite. We will take that time that gets freed up on their work week and invest it back into our customers. And John, we're optimistic that, that will help from a sales growth perspective as well. So we're going to do our regional pilot that we're currently in. We will expand to 4 additional regions in this Q3 period. And then we will read and react based on the business results, the change management learnings. And then, John, we will determine the pace with which we will bring it to the rest of the country. And I don't have a declarative end date for that project because I want the success of the project and the change management learnings to determine the speed and pace with which we go.
John, I'll toss it back to you if you have any follow-up."

Here's the behavior change that drove it, and it's really clear. We changed their compensation. In the prior compensation model, they were paid more on increase the profitability of an existing customer than they were on win new bus",514,"Lauren, good question. Here's the behavior change that drove it, and it's really clear. We changed their compensation. In the prior compensation model, they were paid more on increase the profitability of an existing customer than they were on win new business. That's what I meant earlier when I said we had a disincentive in our system. That was never our intention. We didn't want for them to not be out prospecting. But if they had an hour to spend, they were going to spend that hour on increasing the profitability of an existing customer, and they weren't going to spend it on prospecting. In our new compensation model, which is the base plus bonus, the bonus metrics are configurable. We can make them whatever we want them to be. In fact, we can change them quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month on what matters, and we've been doing exactly that. 
So now we have a better balance between improving penetration of lines with existing customers, which is a profit driver, and it's super important, and we need to better balance it with new customer prospecting. So the biggest reason for our improvement in our performance, Lauren, and new customer growth is a behavior change. Our associates are spending much more time with new customer prospecting than they were previously. 
And the point you made, which was now how do you retain these customers is paramount. Partly, it's the reason why we're investing in service, why we're investing in no order minimums, why we're investing in not cutting back on delivery frequency. Things like that matter. I don't think I've talked about this yet. We're also investing in payment plans so that we can help our customers with their credit balances through this difficult period of time and not cutting them off because they're having some challenges. We negotiate with each customer one by one, using a predictive model on risk for that customer, and we're helping them. We're helping them make payment plans spread out, smooth out so that they can stay with us. And it will be imperative, Lauren, to do what you said, which is we need to retain these new wins. We need to work on things like Sysco brand penetration for these new wins to increase the profit rate of each of them. We need to add more lines, and that's where our new selling model comes in, and this is the last thing I'll say. 
We need to penetrate other additional categories. They could be buying dry and frozen from us, and they've never considered a broadliner for fresh produce. Guess what? We have one of the best fresh produce businesses in the United States. We turn that inventory on a weekly basis, and we can penetrate produce if we introduce the right salesperson to that customer. So those are the activities: Win the new customer through improved prospecting. Once that customer has been won, penetrate Sysco lines, increase additional categories, provide them with tremendous service, and retention will meet or beat expectations.

I'll start, and then, at the end, I'll toss it over to Aaron for color commentary in addition to what I covered. So international margin, we called it out. I mean it was a difficult quarter from an international perspective. There's 2 reasons why. One is the customer mix. Just to be very clear. Restaurants are closed in France, in the U.K. and in Ireland. They're closed, unlike in the United States where on-prem dining is allowed and delivery and takeout and drive-thrus are robust. Our most profitable customer segment in Europe is closed. They can do takeout and delivery, but takeout and delivery are much, much less activated than they are in the United States. And we anticipate they will be closed until April. So we've got a meaningful headwind in that regard. 
I'm going to weave in here, though, a point you made about long term. I just want to remind everybody that rate before COVID wave 2, the best business in our entire book of business was in France. We were minus 5% in France right before the challenges of this secondary lockdown. So we fully anticipate that the international business will respond just as fast, if not even faster than the United States, once these lockdowns are eased. And again, it's frustrating to us that we think that they're talking Easter, but we can focus on what we can control. So the margin percent is mostly driven by customer penetration mix. We did have some inventory spoilage challenges, Kelly. It's appropriate to call it out. Our business results in Q2 that will think about it from this perspective, France goes from minus 5 to minus 55 in a week. We have fresh inventory. There's challenges when that happens. And the pace and speed with which Europe went into lockdown was significant. 
Similar to what happened, if you remember back in Q4, you remember my narrative, Kelly, from back in Q4, here's what I said, ""Europe entered the lockdown earlier and swifter and came out later and slower."" And I anticipate that same thing is going to happen with this second wave, but we have full expectations that we will come out strong. It's just going to take longer. 
Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you if there's anything you would like to add or if I missed anything."

And so our first objective with Europe is just to get the business back up and running and contributing to the bottom line. 
Kevin did an excellent job of covering 2 of the primary drivers on the rate impact of international, but I do want to -- when he talks about the customers being closed on the inventory obsolescence, but I do want to call out 2 additional elements. One is product mix shift, where across our international operations, on-premises dining is not available, but takeouts or takeaway is, right? We do have a product mix shift into products in support of that is lower margin. 
And then lastly, and perhaps the most materially, we have some business mix shift going on where with France closed and other operations in Europe constrained, we've actually mixed into our Canadian contract business, which is lower margin for -- within the international segment, you're seeing then some of the numbers."

The majority of our transformation is at the local level because that's where the profit is the highest. It's where we have the greatest opportunity to profitably grow, and it's where our new business operating model will have the greatest dividend, and we'll be clear about that on the vectors of growth, how each of these transformation initiatives drives improved business performance. 
At the national level, to oversimplify, the reason we're doing so well with new business capture is these large national customers are looking for a distributor that they have confidence in, that they believe in, that can shift, and this is simple, I know this, on time and in full and be able to stock the inventory that they need to be able to deliver for their thousands of locations. They have tremendous confidence that Sysco is that partner. And we have been very successful in the contract bids this summer and into this fall. And Kelly, one reason why we've been able to be more successful there is we put focus on it. We use this expression, ""Fish where the fish are."" We can see the restaurant ticket data from all the banks and the credit cards, seeing how well QSR is doing, and we needed to win where the growth was happening. And we have the capacity to do it, Kelly, because our overall business volume is  down. 
And as our business volume recovers, you might be thinking, ""Well, Kevin, what's that going to do to your storage and throughput capacity?"" We're working aggressively on that. And there are several things that we can do to make more room in our warehouses for this incremental volume so that it is flowing through to the bottom line, like Aaron said, the way we need it to. SKU rationalization between sites, slower-moving inventory being pulled out of forward-facing locations, et cetera, these are things we can do to improve the throughput of our warehouses to allow us to be able to support this substantial business win that we've had, $1.5 billion net, since the beginning of this crisis. 
So it is as simple as they trust us, we can do the business at a national level, and that business is available for us from a winning perspective. What we need to do is make sure it's a sufficiently profitable business for us, and here's my commitment to all of our investors. We will not bid on business that isn't profitable for our company, and we have been very, very disciplined in the contracts that we've underwritten since the beginning of this crisis."

So great question.

So I think that would be a fair thing to communicate. And it's obvious, right? Where the restrictions are the greatest, that's where the closures are the highest. John, we're not seeing any specific cuisine type having a higher rate of closure. 
And again, on the closure side, is it temporary? Is it permanent? What I've been pretty consistent in the beginning of this crisis to communicate is we believe there will be an elevation in churn over this tumultuous period. But from an overall bankruptcy rate perspective or the number of doors in the market 2 years from now, I don't believe it's going to be meaningfully different than the number we have now. There'll be an elevation in churn, but there's not going to be a substantial, substantial reduction in customer doors. 
I know that select agencies have come out and said bold statistics like 30% to 40% bankruptcies. It's just not what we see. It's not what we see in our data. And as I've said before, if a person owns their family restaurant and this is what they've done for 25 years, they're not going to close and become a plumber. They may have to temporary close. They may have to close that business to restructure their debt. And guess what? They're probably going to reopen a restaurant at some point in time. So we believe the independent restaurant customers are fighters, as I said in my prepared remarks. And they're doing a terrific job in light of the conditions that they're dealing with to stay in business, and we're proud of the work that we're doing.

Given your cash flow, given your cash, when does it -- or does it makes sense to be opportunistic in this difficult-to-enter urban markets from a foodservice distributor perspective and maybe buy some share as opposed to just winning it organically? First question in the United States. 
And secondly, I mean I would think there'd be some conversations with Europe right now. It's either, ""Hey, let's scale out of a market that's always more difficult to do business than the U.S. or maybe it's time to double down in Europe in some way."" Where is your current thinking in terms of the continent?"
189096,701606738,2188692,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Okay, John. Thank you. Two-part question. I'll do the first part. I'll say a couple of comments on international. And Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you if there's anything you want to add to the international part of that question. Your question, John,",694,"Okay, John. Thank you. Two-part question. I'll do the first part. I'll say a couple of comments on international. And Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you if there's anything you want to add to the international part of that question. 
Your question, John, on the first part was metro markets where I've told you previously, we under indexed as a percent of our total. In fact, it was a year ago today that I told you that, that was going to be a big focus of our company, that we could win in the metro markets. And John, that still exists. That is still absolutely an opportunity for this company. I put that project on pause given places like New York and Chicago and L.A. are closed for business, figure of speech only. And it wouldn't have been a prudent time for us to do that. We have a couple of pilots going. We can talk more about this in May. This is one of our vectors of growth is to improve our performance in those metro markets. We have a very significant financial opportunity when we close the gap at those metro markets to our national total from a sales and profit growth perspective.
And it's more, John, of a supply chain opportunity than it is anything else. We need to deliver more frequently to those customers. We need to do same-day, next-day delivery to those customers. As you know, they've got these tiny backrooms. They can't have big bulk storage. They need produce delivered on a daily basis, and we've got the capability of doing that. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, but we've got a couple of pilots undergoing that are showing promise, and you're going to see more from Sysco in that capability. 
The more insightful part of your question was like, so when is the right time? And I heard you loud and clear, and we're working on that. I don't have anything declarative to say today on the when, other than we have the ability to invest when we see an activity that will be promising for us, and that will be an area where Sysco improves our capabilities, and we fully expect to be able to win profitable business. The good thing about that business is, as you know, it has a higher profit percentage than other customer types. So it's a pretty attractive market for us. 
On the international side, I haven't talked as much about the new customer wins in international because that business is, right now, doing poorly in aggregate versus the rest of our business because, as Aaron said, the fixed cost deleverage and the overall sales being down. But just in the last quarter, not included actually in the $200 million that I quoted, we have a notable win with a very large customer in Europe -- excuse me, in the U.K. We have a notable win in Sweden. We have a notable win in Ireland. John, we're starting to make traction on new customer wins of substance. 
And what we need to do, in addition to that, though, is win at the local level. And that's been challenging during this crisis because most of our customers in places like Paris actually closed. The government schemes are so robust in France that it's actually more profitable for the restaurant in France to actually temporarily close than to stay open, so it's pretty hard to win new customers when the customers we're trying to serve are closed. But we're going to go after it hard when those markets reopen, a combination of wins at the national level and then incremental wins at the local level. The question I was asked 10 minutes ago on can you bring some of these U.S. best practices across the pond, and we fully intend to do that. 
Aaron, I'll throw it to you for final word. And then I have one comment I want to make about our Q3 trends that I didn't get a chance to cover yet to close out the call. So Aaron, over to you, please."

And from what I can see in early days is we have real pockets of strength in Canada, the U.K., Sweden and Ireland and parts of Latin America. But we also have some opportunities to improve, and the team is working hard against those, notwithstanding COVID crisis.
I'm still getting to know the teams in the businesses. It would be unfair for me to comment on any one part of the business. But one commitment I can make is that our management team will regularly assess the portfolio. And where we need to, we'll take some action. And you saw us do that recently -- most recently in Spain when we divested the Davigel business. So I'm excited to get to know the business better.

And I just want to leave you with one statement of optimism. I know we talked about December being a really tough month for us and that the quarter had sequentially been decelerating. We're seeing the opposite in Q3, which is a good thing. Our January month, which just closed, performed better than December, and we are seeing sequential improvement in our business trends.
I'm even more optimistic into these forward-facing months as those restrictions that are placed upon our customers ease, and it's all going to be tied to the progress that we make in vaccine administration. I think you all know I worked in health care for 8 years before I came here. The news is giving a doomsday scenario on vaccine administration. It's going better than the news is covering it. And what happens next is vaccines are going to begin to be distributed in places like Walmart and Walgreens and CVS. And when we can get 40,000 places in this country administering vaccines and can make meaningful progress on fighting this COVID crisis, we're going to see governments be much more willing to ease restrictions and even places like U.K., where we're in complete lockdown, U.K., as a country, is doing a terrific job with vaccine administration, and that's going to provide an opportunity for a business recovery in calendar 2021, and we're poised and ready to take advantage of it.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. I would summarize our third quarter performance with 4 important points. First, our industry's COVID busin",1762,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. 
I would summarize our third quarter performance with 4 important points. First, our industry's COVID business recovery is here, and the pace of the recovery is accelerating, especially in our domestic U.S. business. Second, we are making excellent progress in our business transformation to better serve our customers and differentiate from our competition. Third, we are winning market share at the national and local customer level. Fourth, our financial results for the third quarter were strong in light of the market conditions, mostly due to improved sales and disciplined expense management. 
As we have previously communicated, we can see in our performance data that once restrictions placed upon our customers are eased, our business results quickly improve. We see tremendous pent-up demand in the food-away-from-home sector. Our data confirms that consumers are eager to eat at restaurants as soon as restrictions are reduced. Strong sales results and long wait times are common in restaurants operating within geographies that have limited restrictions. 
The third quarter can be aptly described is difficult at the beginning and robust at the end. Our January performance was negatively impacted by meaningfully tight restrictions on our customers during the winter COVID lockdown. In February, a substantial winter storm adversely affected our performance in our strongest domestic markets. In contrast, the March sales period exceeded our expectations and bodes well as a strong indicator for the business recovery within our sector. As a result, we exited the third quarter with promising sales trends. 
The improvement is most notable in the Southern third of the United States, where reduced restrictions and warmer weather are generating strong performance results. The results in reopened markets met, and then late in the quarter, surpassed 2019 levels in the important local independent restaurant sector. These results are a positive harbinger of things to come as the Northern regions begin to benefit from easing restrictions that are mostly still in place today. The independent restaurant sector exceeding 2019 sales levels in reopened markets is positive outcome and a rebound timing that is faster than the industry had predicted. 
In Europe, however, restrictions remain firmly in place. Our European countries are experiencing restrictions even stronger than those experienced in the U.S. in April of 2020. Our sales results in Europe reflect those tight restrictions and remain down meaningfully compared to 2019 levels. We remain confident in our ability to succeed in the European markets and expect improvement to begin in the latter half of our fiscal fourth quarter. 
In addition to the softer European performance, our business in the travel, hospitality and foodservice management sectors remain down. Our business penetration in Europe and in foodservice management pre-COVID is creating a lingering delay in the full recovery of our business results in comparison to select other distributors. We are confident that these sectors will recover, but their recovery will be at a slower pace than our core restaurant sector. As a result, when these geographies and segments more fully recover, it will add strength and sustainability of Sysco's recovery, giving us fuel to grow in quarters and years to come. 
All told, we delivered a sales decrease of 13.7% for the quarter. While sales were down compared to 2020, our results reflect an improvement over our second quarter decline of 23%, which is another clear signal that the industry is recovering. The most compelling outcome of the fiscal third quarter is that the local independent restaurant sector was performing well above our expectations as we exited the quarter, with many restaurant partners running sales increases compared to 2019. 
While our third quarter fiscal results were down compared to the prior year, I am pleased to report that we once again delivered a profitable quarter, delivering $437 million of adjusted EBITDA. Sysco was doing more than anyone in the foodservice distribution industry to ensure the success of restaurants and prepare for the return of foodservice demand, which can be seen in our overall market share growth throughout the quarter. 
Cisco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the progress of our recent investments. Our sales teams are actively engaged with new customers and helping existing customers maximize their business during this recovery period. We continue to win business at the national and contract sales level. We have now posted over $1.8 billion of net new wins since the start of the pandemic with another strong quarter of new contracts signed.  I've said on prior calls, the contracts we are writing are at historic profit margins. We are winning the new business due to our supply chain and our service capabilities. 
In addition to the national contract sales wins, we onboarded more new local customers than ever before during the third quarter, fueled by our Restaurants Rising program and our new sales associate compensation model. Our recent industry report confirmed that the number of local restaurants was down approximately 10% to 2019 levels due to permanent closures. The 10% closure is better than most experts had predicted for the industry. 
After posting the strongest quarter ever of new local customer wins at Sysco, you can see on Slide 6 that we are now serving 10% more local customers than we did in fiscal 2019. The fact that we have increased the number of customers that we serve during this pandemic bodes well for our future top line growth when the industry is fully recovered. Our increased customer count positions us well to take market share as the business returns to the food-away-from-home sector in our fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we discussed on our last call, we began making several strategic investments in preparation for the business recovery. These investments increased throughout the fiscal third quarter and will continue in our fourth quarter. We have focused our investments on our customers, our people, our inventory, our technology and our community. These investments have helped position Sysco ahead of the curve for the return of foodservice demand. 
Our investments in our customers, including our Restaurants Rising campaign, make it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. During this uncertain business environment, we have made it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco by waiving delivery minimums on regularly scheduled delivery days. 
We are making investments in our people, including increasing our efforts to proactively staff in advance of the business recovery curve to ensure we have the right number of people in the right locations at the right time to be able to ship on time and in full to our customers. At Sysco, we expect to hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of our fiscal year. 
We have a full court press on hiring warehouse selectors and drivers. Throughout our industry, drivers are indeed in short supply, and hiring is a challenge. We are pulling every lever to ensure we meet our hiring targets. While this hiring investment will increase our operational expenses in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the business recovery. 
We are also making investments in inventory to properly position our warehouses to support customer demand. Currently, Sysco has inventory on hand and on order in a combined amount that is greater than our inventory position before the COVID crisis began. Our ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry. 
Due to our strong balance sheet, we are uniquely positioned to be able to make investments in inventory to ensure we can accelerate growth faster than the overall recovery. We are seeing pressure and constraints in the supply chain as select suppliers struggle with meeting increased demand levels. This is known as the supply chain [indiscernible] effect as market conditions rebound. At Sysco, we have seen this constraint coming and have been partnering with our top suppliers for more than 90 days to preposition inventory at our warehouses. We view this as an opportunity to grow our business and take additional market share. 
We are continuing our strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. Our technology platform is being meaningfully improved so that we can better serve our customers. We're making it easier for our customers to order products through our Sysco Shop platform, and we are implementing a best-in-class pricing software. We will discuss both of these topics in detail at our Investor Day. 
Lastly, our corporate social responsibility initiatives in 2025 goals are progressing well. Our industry-leading CSR efforts are setting the standard for care in progress across 3 pillars of people, product and planet. We are making great strides on this very important work, as evidenced by our recent announcement with Cargill, which is a critical partnership, along with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to improve sustainable grazing practices across 1 million acres of grassland. This effort helps to improve soil health, promote biodiversity and increase carbon storage and safeguard the livelihoods of ranchers and the communities in which we serve. This progress is also good for our business as our customers can buy Sysco product with confidence, knowing the environmental and social benefits we bring to their table. 
At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other food service distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers, and our customers' success will generate business growth for Sysco. 
I would like to invite everyone to our May 20 Investor Day. At that important meeting, we will provide you with the details of our strategic growth plan and how that plan will deliver compelling financial results. Please plan to join us virtually on May 20, and Neil will provide you with the details and logistics. 
I want to give a heart health thanks to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. I am proud of their dedication during this dynamic operating environment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our third quarter results along with additional financial details. Aaron, over to you."
189096,711962733,2268332,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Improving sales trends, a profitable quarter and strong cash flow, those are our key headlines. Our fiscal third quarter presented us with the beginning of a restaurant recovery in the United States, countered by cont",2104,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Improving sales trends, a profitable quarter and strong cash flow, those are our key headlines. 
Our fiscal third quarter presented us with the beginning of a restaurant recovery in the United States, countered by continued business disruption in the international and foodservice management parts of our portfolio. As a result, we balanced 5 financial priorities: tactical investments in inventory, team and equipment to get ahead of the business recovery; strategic investments and capabilities and technologies to advance the transformation; careful cost control to mitigate the impact of the COVID environment on our bottom line; purposeful reduction of our indebtedness; and of course, continued return of capital to shareholders through our dividend payments, totaling $689 million so far this fiscal year. 
As Kevin called out, we were delighted to see the improving sales trends and the progress on profit, and I will speak more on the income statement shortly. I would like to start today with an emphasis on the strong position we are in as we move up the recovery curve and how that strength is impacting our view of the cash flow and the balance sheet. 
Recall, at the end of the second quarter, we had $5.8 billion of cash. During the third quarter, we generated positive cash from operations of $543 million, offset by $83 million of net capital investment, leaving us with incremental positive free cash flow for the third quarter of $460 million. 
Working capital was a source of cash for us in the quarter even though we invested heavily in inventory. And as Kevin pointed out, we ended the third quarter with inventory on hand and inventory on order exceeding pre-COVID levels. 
And we benefited from a significant increase in payables at quarter end. We saw rising normal course receivables balances as our customers started purchasing more. But we also made excellent progress on obtaining timely payment from our customers on both pre-COVID and post-COVID bills. 
For the 9-month period, even the face of COVID-19, Sysco generated an impressive $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This strong cash flow was approximately $300 million better than we had forecast earlier this year, driven by the combination of higher sales and profit, working capital benefit and lower CapEx than forecast back in the first quarter.  All in, we ended the third quarter with $4.9 billion of cash on hand. 
We expect that the fourth quarter will bring continued progress on the EBITDA line. It is also expected to bring investments in working capital as we continue to invest in inventory and as the payables which provided us with benefit in the third quarter come due in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are forecasting flattish free cash flow for the fourth quarter, leaving us with free cash for the year of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. 
Given our balance sheet, our strong cash generation and our optimism for the business recovery, early in the third quarter, we announced that we were continuing the process of reducing our debt levels. We paid down $1.1 billion on that date funded by cash on hand, and you will see that change in leverage reflected in our third quarter financials. 
What you will not yet see in the financials is that subsequent to the end of our third quarter, we repaid an additional GBP 200 million on the outstanding amount of the U.K. commercial paper program. And we will later this week pay off the remaining GBP 100 million balance on that program, which will bring our debt levels down by approximately $1.5 billion since the start of the third quarter and down by $2.3 billion since the start of this fiscal year. 
Stay tuned for a discussion of our capital allocation strategy at Investor Day. 
Okay. Let's turn to the income statement. Given the interest in the shape of the COVID-19 recovery curve, for the next couple of quarters, we will disclose sales comparisons against both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Third quarter sales were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 13.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 19.3% decrease from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. But with the important qualification that in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we began to lap the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. 
Indeed, looking at the monthly progression measured against fiscal '19, our sales were down 23% and 14% in January, February and March, reflecting the impact of COVID across the quarter. February would have been better but for the impact of the winter storm in the U.S. during the last week of February. 
We are also disclosing today on a onetime basis that our April sales were approximately $4.4 billion, up 102.1% from prior year and improving to only down 8.8% from fiscal 2019. Our United States sales in the U.S. Foodservice segment were down 5.3% versus fiscal 2019, and SYGMA was up 12% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the increase in restaurant traffic and orders as the lockdowns eased in the U.S. We will continue to benefit as the U.S. reopening advances. 
In contrast, Europe, Canada and Latin America regressed in the third quarter as a result of strict lockdowns that are now expected to continue, in some cases, until the end of May and as a result of slower progress in vaccination. The slower international recovery will continue to impact our fourth quarter results and may carry into early quarters of fiscal 2022, depending on vaccination progress by country. However, we see good news in the recent reopening taking place in the United Kingdom. 
Here are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 9.7%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 14.1%. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 77 basis points on our sales results. 
As we move down the P&L, gross profit was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, decreasing 17.2% versus same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 77 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 as our rate came in just a touch shy of 18%. 
The primary reason for the gross margin dilution is business mix. Our sales and our generally higher-margin European business were down, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. Along the same lines, our sales in our lower-margin Sigma business were up, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. We also saw a modest margin dilution in each of the business segments with varying causes from product mix shift, the timing by market of the interplay between passing along inflation and implementing our transformation initiatives. 
Adjusted operating expense decreased 14.7% to just under $1.9 billion, and we saw a modest improvement of operating expense leverage, even with lower sales to prior year. Our expense profile reflected the counterweights of good cost out achievement, balanced against our investments for the recovery curve and our investments against the transformation agenda. 
As part of this, we targeted and achieved increased significant cost savings. We are on track to surpass our fiscal 2021 goal of $315 million of cost savings. We expect to drive continued cost savings opportunities to help fuel our future growth agenda, a topic I will discuss more at Investor Day in 2 weeks. 
Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 32% to $256 million. For the third quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 14.3% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 51.1% to $0.22 for the quarter. 
Just say a few words on our third quarter results by business segment, starting with U.S. Foodservice operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 12.8% versus the prior year period. In the rapidly evolving environment, the business again acquired a record number of new customers as our sales teams hit the streets, and we deployed digital tools. 
We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. This business, our biggest business, is moving up the COVID recovery curve rapidly. Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the third quarter decreased 116 basis points to 37.3% of total U.S. cases, driven by customer and product mix shift. With respect to local U.S. case, the Sysco brand sales decreased 234 basis points to 44.5%, which was driven by product mix shift into prepackaged and takeaway-ready products. Regaining Sysco brand sales levels and the healthy margins that come with them will be a focus for fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Gross profit for U.S. Foodservice decreased 13.7% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 16.1% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income decreased 8.3% to $525 million. Product cost inflation was 3.5% versus prior year, driven by deflationary categories in fiscal 2020. 
Moving to the SYGMA segment. For the third consecutive quarter, sales increased during the third fiscal quarter to $1.6 billion, a 15.9% increase over fiscal 2020 and a 3% increase over fiscal 2019, driven by the success of national regional quickservice restaurants servicing drive-thru traffic. 
While we are pleased with the team's efforts during COVID, SYGMA is our lowest margin segment, and our team is carefully calibrating our efforts in that business, particularly as it relates to negotiating agreements with customers. As a result, starting during our fiscal fourth quarter, we will be taking an opportunity to transition away from a large existing regional customer. The financials of that relationship do not meet our preferred profile, and we will be focusing on freeing up capacity for more profitable customers. Going forward, we will continue to be diligent in our contract review and approval process across the enterprise. 
Gross profit increased 12.3% to $133 million for the quarter, while gross margin was down 27 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11.1% to $121 million, and adjusted operating income increased 24.1% to $13 million all at SYGMA. 
Moving to the international segment. As I mentioned earlier, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 31.3%, while gross profit decreased 35.1% and gross margin decreased 110 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of country mix, customer mix and product mix. 
For the international segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 15.8%, leading to an adjusted operating loss of $92 million. We are confident that international will be a significant recovery opportunity for our company in fiscal 2022. 
Our other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains in the COVID recovery starting blocks as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. While still in turnaround mode, the business improved its underlying profitability during the third quarter. Additionally, our Guest Worldwide business signed a substantial new customer contract during the quarter that will be very beneficial to the segment as the travel and hospitality sectors recover. 
That concludes my prepared remarks on the third quarter. We are not providing further guidance for the fourth quarter, other than to observe that we continue to monitor our operating environment carefully. While operational challenges remain for many of our customers, we are seeing excellent demand in our core business in the key markets in the center and the South. And we are seeing green shoots on the Coast as markets reopen. 
Let's be clear. The upswing has begun, and we expect continued progress across the largest parts of our portfolio in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our team remains resolutely focused on driving our businesses, aggressively managing the business recovery and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. As we did in the third quarter, we will continue to deploy our balance sheet to invest in inventory, technology and our people to stay ahead of the recovery curve while also reducing our indebtedness. 
During our Investor Day in 2 weeks, Kevin and the executive leadership team will offer more detailed perspective on the business, on our growth plans for fiscal 2022 and beyond and provide further specifics on our transformation efforts. We will comment on our post-COVID capital allocation strategy, including the breadth and depth of our organic and inorganic investment plans, our plans for further debt reduction and how we're thinking about continued shareholder returns. We look forward to seeing you participate in that virtual event. 
Thank you for your attention. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Just on the new customer prospecting, we're very proud of those results. As I said in my prepared remarks, largest single quarter ever in the history of the company from a new customer wins perspective. For those that are keeping score, I said the same thing in Q2. We actually just upped the performance that we posted in Q2. So we've got 2 consecutive quarters of record levels of new customer prospecting. 
The why is pretty straightforward, a, we made it a big priority for our sales force. We're a company that manages what we expect and we manage what we measure, and we have impact on the things that we focus upon. The second is, as I've spoken pretty openly about, we removed a barrier in our prior compensation program that got in the way of prospecting. So we changed our sales consultant compensation late last summer. It took a quarter or 2 for that to really kick in and get the change management going and get to a level of understanding of the key components of that program. And we've made it now financially beneficial for our sales consultants to prospect because it's good for us, and it's now good for them equally. 
So 2 basic reasonably simple premises, which is we've made it a priority. We're tracking it. We're measuring it. We have goals specifically by sales consultant on new customer prospecting, and the financial compensation rewards them for that activity. And it obviously rewards our company as we are able to win new business profitably and grow over time. 
As I said in my prepared remarks as well, it's less visible on our total top line because in many cities in this country, there are still significant restaurant restrictions. But those new customer wins are going to pay dividend and fruit for us as this recovery that we are now a part of begins to further accelerate in our Q4 and then into fiscal 2022. So we're really pleased with it. 
Second part of the question was about Restaurants Rising. Do we expect it to continue? And was it a big driver of the wins? I would say yes, that would be my point #3, which would be restaurants rising was a barrier that previously got in the way for a new customer coming over to Sysco. We had pretty strict and rigorous delivery days and minimums. And we've eliminated that barrier. 
Will that stay? We'll talk more about that on our May 20 Investor Day. I'm not ready this morning to make an announcement in that regard."

I would say for fiscal '22, I would expect for our independent mix to be higher for a couple of factors: one, the number of wins that we're talking about; two, and we did say this in our prepared remarks, foodservice management, hospitality, travel are down still pretty significantly and have a slower recovery curve. So I think those 2 factors put side by side would indicate that the balance of our total would be shifting. 
One counterpoint to that is one of our strongest sector, this is our SYGMA sector, we're running double-digit increases to prior year in SYGMA. And that is margin rate dilutive because of the fact that SYGMA are least profitable rate business. So Aaron can talk more about that on May 20. He's prepared to talk about where we're headed as a company, Ed. So those are comments for fiscal 2022. 
If I look over the longer term, our expectation is each of the sectors that we play in will recover to pre-COVID levels. They're each going to recover on a different curve, which we've tracked, and we've mapped. We're using the Technomic data to predict when that will occur. What we said from a point of optimism perspective is each of those businesses is actually ahead of schedule versus what Technomic had predicted, which is a positive harbinger of what's to come in fiscal 2022 and beyond. We expect to take share in each of those sectors. That's my best way of putting a kind of period at the end of the sentence. We have growth strategies in place for how to win in each of those sectors. So as each sector recovers and we take share, if you're asking me 2 years from now, 3 years from now, will we see meaningfully different balance of sale by customer, I wouldn't suggest that. I would say each of the sectors will grow. And it's hard to predict 3 years from now what the precise balance of sale will be. But hopefully, post-Investor Day, there'll be more clarity to that."

You've read obviously about the restaurants themselves and how much they're struggling with filling their jobs. And then drivers, in particular, are in short supply nationwide, and frankly, in multiple countries within which we operate. 
Here's one meaningful point of difference between Sysco in, let's call it, the restaurant. Our jobs are excellent paying jobs. We do not have a wage challenge. We do not have a minimum wage challenge. Even if the nation went to a $15 minimum, we do not have pressure in that regard. Our driver jobs are excellent paying jobs, strong benefits, they're attractive positions. 
Our issue and what I spoke to on the call today is creating awareness to those jobs. So we've had to do things in this quarter -- in the quarter we're in, Q3 and Q4, to increase advertising to create awareness. We've had to do some things, to create sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses. So the incremental expenses that I was referring to were more of that than structural permanent increases to the wage, which would dilute margin. So I view this as actually a little bit more of a transitory activity where we're needing to hire over 6,000 people in our second half of our fiscal year. And there are select pockets within the country that are really tight, and we're doing some things to create awareness of our job. 
So we're confident in our ability to improve our profit ratio in the future. We have a cost takeout program that is substantial. That will help offset any pressures we would see in wage. We've said previously that we've taken $350 million of permanent structural cost out of our business, and that's also something that Aaron will talk about in more detail on May 20."

I'm excited about our progress against our cost savings effort. Just to go back for a second, what we had targeted for fiscal '21 was $350 million of cost out through a combination of savings and COGS as well as an operating exp",652,"Great question. Thank you. I'm excited about our progress against our cost savings effort. Just to go back for a second, what we had targeted for fiscal '21 was $350 million of cost out through a combination of savings and COGS as well as an operating expense. We are ahead of our forecast in that respect, and we certainly expect to meet or beat our $350 million target for fiscal on '21. 
I'm particularly excited this quarter because the savings are more visible than they have been in previous quarters. And at the sake of distracting us a bit, I thought, well, might do some simple math on the call today just so I could illustrate the point of how we can see the savings having an impact on our P&L and kind of prove the point that they're real, they're there. 
And in particular, as sales go back up and we have the opportunity to have a cleaner view, it will be more obvious to everyone that are out there. So bear with me a second, I'm going to actually walk you through some simple math.  It starts like this. To go back a year, Q3 in fiscal '20, our adjusted OpEx was $2.187 billion, sorry for the decimal points there but given the levels we're talking about. This quarter, in the comparison period, our sales were down 13.7%. So if for the sake of argument, we assumed that our costs were fully variable or not, but if we did, OpEx should have been down about $300 million. 
But Joel guided to you in the past that our cost structure is 1/3 fixed and 2/3 variable. So the variable cost would have been just under $200 million of that $300 million. And we should have suffered from stranded fixed costs of $100 million absolute cost savings actions. That would have put us at $1.98 billion, right, just to continue the simple math as we push ahead. Everyone's hopefully still with me. 
Our adjusted OpEx for this quarter, though, was $1.867 billion, down $320 million, meaning not only do we reduce the variable cost consistent with sales, but we also took out $120 million of fixed costs, which is the whole point of our cost-out effort, right, being able to go quarter-over-quarter before investments, right, be able to take the fixed cost out of the structure. And the nice thing about this quarter is sales are down, and we're able to show that. 
Now I should point out a couple of other things as well. The first is that we did get, call it, $40 million of good guys that are onetime or other benefits that weren't part of the cost out structure. What you can't see is those good guys offset $40 million to $50 million of purposeful investments we made against the recovery against the transformation in OpEx for the quarter as well. We've always committed that we are going to invest against the business. We're going to use some of the savings to advance our agenda. That's what we've done. This quarter just gives us a good example of how we can show the math, showing that it works out. 
On Investor Day, I will have more to say about cost out. And it will talk about, really, Kelly, to the point of part of your question of where is the cost out coming from, how it's coming from the way we've restructured and regionalized our business, how it's coming from a culture of frugality that Kevin is leading, how it's coming from prioritizing our investments and insisting on business cases as we push ahead, really core discipline that you would want and how it's helping us to offset some of the trends or headlines around employee cost or inflation, et cetera, as we carry forward. 
So thanks for the question, a long answer, but I hope that's helpful."

It's definitely accelerating, but I would say that's more of a Q4 fiscal happening than it was a Q3 happening. We all read the paper every day.

It's definitely accelerating, but I would say that's more of a Q4 fiscal happening than it was a Q3 happening. We all read the paper every day. We're seeing what's happening not just in this industry but in every industry. Certainly, the economy is becoming more inflationary. Basic economics are at play here. We have significantly increasing demand, unfortunately, simultaneous with some supply challenges that are pretty well-known out there in the food industry. 
So what is the impact of that? We are seeing sales increasing we will most likely in our Q4 see a slightly dilutive impact on margin rate. And GP dollars, however, hopefully, would be in a growth mode, but to be determined on our ability to pass-through this inflation to our customers. So here's what we're seeing, consumers, people who are actually going to the restaurants themselves are showing a willingness to pay a higher ticket. I think you've heard other restaurant people that you personally cover talk about that. 
We are seeing restaurant partners being willing to increase their menu prices, and we're working with them. That's a part of what Sysco does. We consult with them we teach them, we educate them on the impact of the inflation on the COGS that we are all experiencing. And we're providing suggestions on alternative product to offset the cost. And also, we're providing suggestions on where some price increases on the menu could take place. 
Important though and notable point, food-away-from-home right now is a very competitive on a price basis versus retail grocery. I think you all know that this time last year, retail grocers did a good job managing their business. And they essentially eliminated promos because they didn't need them anymore, and they are running double digit comps. So prices at the retail grocery have gone up on a year-over-year basis. Prices actually had gone down during the COVID crisis within the menu of a restaurant. And I think we're seeing some kind of reestablishment of cost. I heard someone on [ swap ] this morning actually say this term, reinflation, which is last year was deflationary, and we're actually now kind of getting back to where we would have been if 2020 wouldn't have been what it was. So let's call that a catch-up. 
Last point for me, and then I'll talk about what we're doing with our customers. I do expect for the supply to demand equation to normalize over time, meaning suppliers will be smart and they'll ramp up demand. And then therefore, some of this inflation pressure will decrease. I just don't know how long it's going to take. What we're doing is we're closely, closely managing this. I think you know we have many contracts that have contracted. It's a percent of COGS or it's a fixed spread to COGS. And also, we have many contracts, local independent customers to be specific, where we do not have contracts. 
And Kelly, that's where today, it's mostly manual. Done by our sales teams, and we're providing guidance on how to manage it, but it's manual. To your point, the Periscope system that we are deploying will help us greatly on these types of things. We will be much more scientific and specific on how we call specific choices by category on what we want to pass-through and what we don't want to pass-through and then we can guarantee it is showing up in Sysco Shop in front of the customer. 
Unfortunately, as you know, we're still in the middle of that rollout. In fact, we're not in the middle. We're in the beginning part of that rollout. Since last quarter, we've expanded Periscope to 5 additional regions. And we're in the second half of this calendar year, going to complete that rollout. So yes, Periscope will be a tremendous benefit to these types of environmental conditions in the future. It's exactly why we need the tool. Good question. Thank you for asking."

I think what you're asking, and I'll just say it pretty bluntly, the biggest players in this space have been net winners since the beginning of this pandemic. And I've been asked point blank, the question is, Kevin, you're saying, in 2 other big companies are saying you're winning share, how can that be true? How that can be true is if you have the market share of those 3 companies? Together combined, we're less than half of the total in the marketplace.

It's just the number of cases per unique stop are tend to be lower for a new customer win, as you indicated."

One is you talked about a strategy of going after new cuisine or individual cuisine types, how much evidence was that in this quarter in these new wins? Or was this just broader because the sales force has been refashioned? And similarly, on your pricing tool that you've talked about, I know you're not rolled out yet, but is the net result of that, that you're going to be sharper on pricing? Or is it not that it's simply a pricing transparency, and that just gets you more wins because of that?"

And I would put our cuisine-based selling into that third bucket. 
I view the cuisine based selling upside opportunity to be just as much for existing customers. We serve thousands and thousands of Mexican restaurant customers, Asian customers, Italian customers. And what we're doing with our cuisine-based selling program is improving the category strategy to serve those customers, the marketing and merchandising, promotional strategy to serve those customers and then serving them up and teeing them up in a very clear, coherent, cogent digestible manner, both in Sysco Shop and through our sales force. It's kind of a best of both digital and human capital. 
We're still in the early innings of that work, to be clear. And we're going to talk about that quite extensively on May 20, what that program looks like, how we will roll that program out. And we look forward to being able to share that with you on that day."

We actually need to lower our prices for those items, which will result in sales increases at a slightly lower margin rate, which flows through to GP dollars being put into the bank. 
Simultaneously, we have the opportunity on what we call the tail over our assortment or inelastic SKUs to nominally increase price to be able to offset the investments we're making on the KPIS. So how we've described it in aggregate is, for the most part, margin rate will be flat constant. And this is a sales gain growth opportunity for us as we are right on price, sharper on known value items. And we know that the #1 reason why a customer leaves the distributor is because of trust and pricing and fairness in pricing. And we need to tackle that head on."

So I'm going to try to answer what I think was the spirit of your question, but I'll -- I'll start with the ending, which is change versus the local independents. The chain universe has covered pretty prolifically publicly, and I think you all know that data. Certainly, the fast food QSR space has been on fire. Anything with the chicken sandwich has been on fire. Our SYGMA sector reflects that double-digit increases to prior year from a sales perspective. 
The pleasant surprise in our Q3 and then it's accelerating in our Q4 is the strength of the local independent customer in the fully reopened markets, producing results that are above 2019. That exceeds our expectations that exceeds Technomics prediction by about 18 months, frankly. But there are still major geographies that are still closed. I just want to be clear about that. New York, Boston, Chicago, most of California is still confronted with major restrictions. Our European business is still dealing with major restrictions. So we're very optimistic about the health and strength of that local independent customer. It's our most profitable segment, as you well know. And when you combine just the general recovery curve of what independents are doing, coupled with our 10% increase in the number of doors that we serve when an industry is down 10%, so we have a 20% delta our number of unique doors versus the industry's overall performance. As we see more markets opening up, reducing restrictions, we have a strong tailwind here in front of us."

Those are the folks that work in the warehouse and then drivers. We're actually going to change the name of the driver piece to be more reflective of the work. We're actually going to start calling them delivery partners because they actually partner with our sales team to activate sales at the local level. But for now, sales consultants, selectors, drivers. 
Sales consultants, we're -- that team is just killing it out there right now, as we talked about earlier. We will be in a position of actually adding sales consultants in fiscal 2022 based on the investments we want to make in our team-based selling model. We've said publicly, and we'll talk about it more on May 20, we're going to add more specialists to be able to complement our existing broadline sales consultants. 
Warehouse selectors again, as I said a little bit earlier, we pay a very fair wage for those jobs. Those are excellent jobs. And we have a ton of hiring to do. I mentioned that we're going to hire over 6,000 people in total for our spring season. How I would describe our warehouse selectors is we're on track. We manage it day-to-day, week-to-week with hiring goals by site, by location. And we are green, meaning in a good position, green on our warehouse selector hiring. 
The more difficult job to fill at this point in time is our driver job. And it's not because of wage. As I said earlier, our wage for our driver role is terrific. It's about creating more awareness of those jobs. The overall macro impact on drivers is the age of the driver in this country is getting up there. People are retiring, and there's too few people going into that line of work. I would say I'm actually inspired by what United Airlines has done. They have the exact same problem with pilots, and they've just purchased and are going to in-source a pilot school. While I'm not announcing anything today on this call, what I would submit to all of you is Sysco is going to be very progressive and be the industry leader on creating a pipeline of drivers for our long-term success. And we're not going to let it get in the way of our growth. 
If I could add to that, just to go back to some of the core themes, which is, look, we have significant scale across the industry, and we have capabilities, whether it's with our -- in our buildings with our selectors, with the pipeline and the drivers, with the sales teams. We're an attractive employer in so many ways from a wage of benefit perspective. We don't have the issues that many do in the industry. We have great retention rates in the employees that we have. And as it relates to cost, we have the opportunity, we've already proven, that we can bring -- and we are bringing our costs down so that both we can improve the bottom line, but also we can invest where necessary. And in Q2 and Q3, you've heard us talk about the fact that we are investing in the recovery and investing against our team to be able to drive our successes in enterprise going forward."

One is just the fill rates, as we call it, outbound to our customers, we're experiencing supplier fill rate challenges to Sysco, as are all distributors. We track it by supplier. We are very, very rigorous on our ability to improve those performance data. And for those that can't improve, we move volume from supplier A to supplier B in order to ensure that we can ship to our customers. And we are doing that aggressively right now. We partner with our suppliers. We give a joint business plan. We provide rolling forecasts. But if they can't meet our demand, we're going to find a supplier who can. 
The strength of Sysco is because of our size and our scale, we can do that work more effectively than anyone else in this space, which allows us to ship on time and in full to our customers. There are some specific unique products that are really challenging right now, chicken wings, shortening, to be specific, just to provide 2 examples. But we are doing an enormous amount of work to ensure that we can fill customers' orders. 
As it relates to on-time delivery, meaning the truck arriving within a window that our customers want, we're actually going to talk about exactly that topic on May 20. Marie Robinson, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, is giving a tremendous amount of work. We're excited about the progress that we are making to be more agile, more flexible and more customer-focused supply chain. We're bringing a mentality of customer-first to work our way back versus what's good for Sysco and fit them into our designed model. So more on that on May 20, and we're excited about -- talking with you about that. 
As it relates to metro versus suburban, yes, I don't think that you should draw a bright line there to say on time rates or preferred windows are better suburban versus metro. What I would say is something I actually talked about a year ago when we put that project on pause because of COVID and how we're reinvigorating it. Small restaurants in an urban setting have really small backrooms. They actually need more frequent delivery. And we're going to talk to you about that on May 20."

We're looking at mid-May of the earliest as to when the restrictions will begin easing with one exception. U.K. opened up outdoor dining 2 weeks ago, and you need a reservation to get an outdoor dining appointment in the U.K. It's being so warmly received. So mid-May to late May is when most of the European countries are going to begin the process of easing restrictions. So it's still a struggle in Europe, but we do anticipate a recovery. There's certainly pent-up demand in Europe for eating at restaurants. And we're confident actually that our ability to succeed in Europe is increasing, not decreasing. 
Aaron talked about, one, we have a very notable FSM win in the U.K. that we've signed during this pandemic. That will pay dividend in the future when that business begins to recover. We can talk about that more in the future. 
As it relates to M&A, we're not going to comment on any M&A activity unless there was activity to comment on. I would say our European strategy is more fixed the things that were broken. France, we had some self-inflicted wounds. We have used this crisis to meaningfully stabilize our performance in France. And I would describe France as we're ready now for the reopening of restaurants to be able to win back lost business and to take a significantly expanded product range and go out and start winning business. 
In the U.K., our biggest opportunity is to win new independent local customers, and we're going to talk with you about that on May 20. Our new international leader. Tim Orteng will go actually country by country, explaining our strategy to win in each country."

I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy.  
I would summarize our third quarter performance with 4 important points. First, our industry's COVID business recovery is here, and the pace of the recovery is accelerating, especially in our domestic U.S. business. Second, we are making excellent progress in our business transformation to better serve our customers and differentiate from our competition. Third, we are winning market share at the national and local customer level. Fourth, our financial results for the third quarter were strong in light of the market conditions, mostly due to improved sales and disciplined expense management.  
As we have previously communicated, we can see in our performance data that once restrictions placed upon our customers are eased, our business results quickly improve. We see tremendous pent-up demand in the food-away-from-home sector. Our data confirms that consumers are eager to eat at restaurants as soon as restrictions are reduced. Strong sales results and long wait times are common in restaurants operating within geographies that have limited restrictions.  
The third quarter can be aptly described is difficult at the beginning and robust at the end. Our January performance was negatively impacted by meaningfully tight restrictions on our customers during the winter COVID lockdown. In February, a substantial winter storm adversely affected our performance in our strongest domestic markets. In contrast, the March sales period exceeded our expectations and bodes well as a strong indicator for the business recovery within our sector. As a result, we exited the third quarter with promising sales trends.  
The improvement is most notable in the Southern third of the United States, where reduced restrictions and warmer weather are generating strong performance results. The results in reopened markets met, and then late in the quarter, surpassed 2019 levels in the important local independent restaurant sector. These results are a positive harbinger of things to come as the Northern regions begin to benefit from easing restrictions that are mostly still in place today.  
The independent restaurant sector exceeding 2019 sales levels in reopened markets is positive outcome and a rebound timing that is faster than the industry had predicted.  
In Europe, however, restrictions remain firmly in place. Our European countries are experiencing restrictions even stronger than those experienced in the U.S. in April of 2020. Our sales results in Europe reflect those tight restrictions and remain down meaningfully compared to 2019 levels. We remain confident in our ability to succeed in the European markets and expect improvement to begin in the latter half of our fiscal fourth quarter.  
In addition to the softer European performance, our business in the travel, hospitality and foodservice management sectors remain down. Our business penetration in Europe and in foodservice management pre-COVID is creating a lingering delay in the full recovery of our business results in comparison to select other distributors. We are confident that these sectors will recover, but their recovery will be at a slower pace than our core restaurant sector.  
As a result, when these geographies and segments more fully recover, it will add strength and sustainability of Sysco's recovery, giving us fuel to grow in quarters and years to come.  
All told, we delivered a sales decrease of 13.7% for the quarter. While sales were down compared to 2020, our results reflect an improvement over our second quarter decline of 23%, which is another clear signal that the industry is recovering. The most compelling outcome of the fiscal third quarter is that the local independent restaurant sector was performing well above our expectations as we exited the quarter, with many restaurant partners running sales increases compared to 2019. While our third quarter fiscal results were down compared to the prior year, I am pleased to report that we once again delivered a profitable quarter, delivering $437 million of adjusted EBITDA. Sysco was doing more than anyone in the foodservice distribution industry to ensure the success of restaurants and prepare for the return of foodservice demand, which can be seen in our overall market share growth throughout the quarter.  
Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the progress of our recent investments. Our sales teams are actively engaged with new customers and helping existing customers maximize their business during this recovery period. We continue to win business at the national and contract sales level. We have now posted over $1.8 billion of net new wins since the start of the pandemic with another strong quarter of new contracts signed. I've said on prior calls, the contracts we are writing are at historic profit margins. We are winning the new business due to our supply chain and our service capabilities.  
In addition to the national contract sales wins, we onboarded more new local customers than ever before during the third quarter. Fueled by our Restaurants Rising program and our new sales associate compensation model, our recent industry report confirmed that the number of local restaurants was down approximately 10% to 2019 levels due to permanent closures. The 10% closure is better than most experts had predicted for the industry. After posting the strongest quarter ever of new local customer wins at Sysco, you can see on Slide 6 that we are now serving 10% more local customers than we did in fiscal 2019. The fact that we have increased the number of customers that we serve during this pandemic bodes well for our future top line growth when the industry is fully recovered. Our increased customer count positions us well to take market share as the business returns to the food-away-from-home sector in our fiscal 2022 and beyond.  
As we discussed on our last call, we began making several strategic investments in preparation for the business recovery. These investments increased throughout the fiscal third quarter and will continue in our fourth quarter. We have focused our investments on our customers, our people, our inventory, our technology and our community. These investments have helped position Sysco ahead of the curve for the return of foodservice demand.  
Our investments in our customers, including our Restaurants Rising campaign, make it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. During this uncertain business environment, we have made it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco by waiving delivery minimums on regularly scheduled delivery days. We are making investments in our people, including increasing our efforts to proactively staff in advance of the business recovery curve to ensure we have the right number of people in the right locations at the right time to be able to ship on time and in full to our customers. At Sysco, we expect to hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of our fiscal year. We have a full court press on hiring warehouse selectors and drivers. Throughout our industry, drivers are indeed in short supply, and hiring is a challenge. We are pulling every lever to ensure we meet our hiring targets. While this hiring investment will increase our operational expenses in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the business recovery.  
We are also making investments in inventory to properly position our warehouses to support customer demand. Currently, Sysco has inventory on hand and on order in a combined amount that is greater than our inventory position before the COVID crisis began. Our ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry.  
Due to our strong balance sheet, we are uniquely positioned to be able to make investments in inventory to ensure we can accelerate growth faster than the overall recovery. We are seeing pressure and constraints in the supply chain as select suppliers struggle with meeting increased demand levels. This is known as the supply chain bullwhip effect as market conditions rebound. At Sysco, we have seen this constraint coming and have been partnering with our top suppliers for more than 90 days to pre-position inventory at our warehouses. We view this as an opportunity to grow our business and take additional market share.  
We are continuing our strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. Our technology platform is being meaningfully improved so that we can better serve our customers. We're making it easier for our customers to order products through our Sysco Shop platform, and we are implementing a best-in-class pricing software. We will discuss both of these topics in detail at our Investor Day.  
Lastly, our corporate social responsibility initiatives in 2025 goals are progressing well. Our industry-leading CSR efforts are setting the standard for care and progress across 3 pillars of people, product and planet. We are making great strides on this very important work, as evidenced by our recent announcement with Cargill, which is a critical partnership, along with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to improve sustainable grazing practices across 1 million acres of grassland. This effort helps to improve soil health, promote biodiversity and increase carbon storage and safeguard the livelihoods of ranchers and the communities in which we serve.  
This progress is also good for our business as our customers can buy Sysco product with confidence, knowing the environmental and social benefits we bring to their table.  
At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other food service distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers and our customers' success will generate business growth for Sysco.  
I would like to invite everyone to our May 20 Investor Day. At that important meeting, we will provide you with the details of our strategic growth plan and how that plan will deliver compelling financial results. Please plan to join us virtually on May 20, and we will provide you with the details and logistics.  
I want to give a heartfelt thanks to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. I am proud of their dedication during this dynamic operating environment.  
I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our third quarter results along with additional financial details. Aaron, over to you."
189096,711962733,2268545,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Improving sales trends, a profitable quarter and strong cash flow, those are our key headlines.  Our fiscal third quarter presented us with the beginning of a restaurant recovery in the United States, countered by con",2103,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Improving sales trends, a profitable quarter and strong cash flow, those are our key headlines.  
Our fiscal third quarter presented us with the beginning of a restaurant recovery in the United States, countered by continued business disruption in the international and foodservice management parts of our portfolio. As a result, we balanced 5 financial priorities, tactical investments in inventory, team and equipment to get ahead of the business recovery; strategic investments in capabilities and technologies to advance the transformation; careful cost control to mitigate the impact of the COVID environment on our bottom line; purposeful reduction of our indebtedness; and of course, continued return of capital to shareholders through our dividend payments, totaling $689 million so far this fiscal year.  
As Kevin called out, we were delighted to see the improving sales trends and the progress on profit, and I will speak more on the income statement shortly. I would like to start today with an emphasis on the strong position we are in as we move up the recovery curve and how that strength is impacting our view of the cash flow and the balance sheet.  
Recall, at the end of the second quarter, we had $5.8 billion of cash. During the third quarter, we generated positive cash from operations of $543 million, offset by $83 million of net capital investment, leaving us with incremental positive free cash flow for the third quarter of $460 million.  
Working capital was a source of cash for us in the quarter even though we invested heavily in inventory. And as Kevin pointed out, we ended the third quarter with inventory on hand and inventory on order exceeding pre-COVID levels. And we benefited from a significant increase in payables at quarter end. We saw rising normal course receivables balances as our customers started purchasing more. But we also made excellent progress on obtaining timely payment from our customers on both pre-COVID and post-COVID bills.  
For the 9-month period, even the face of COVID-19, Sysco generated an impressive $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This strong cash flow was approximately $300 million better than we had forecast earlier this year, driven by the combination of higher sales and profit, working capital benefit and lower CapEx than forecast back in the first quarter.  
All in, we ended the third quarter with $4.9 billion of cash on hand.  
We expect that the fourth quarter will bring continued progress on the EBITDA line. It is also expected to bring investments in working capital as we continue to invest in inventory and as the payables, which provided us with benefit in the third quarter, come due in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are forecasting flattish free cash flow for the fourth quarter, leaving us with free cash for the year of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.  
Given our balance sheet, our strong cash generation and our optimism for the business recovery, early in the third quarter, we announced that we were continuing the process of reducing our debt levels. We paid down $1.1 billion on that date funded by cash on hand, and you will see that change in leverage reflected in our third quarter financials.  
What you will not yet see in the financials is that subsequent to the end of our third quarter, we repaid an additional GBP 200 million on the outstanding amount of the U.K. commercial paper program. And we will, later this week, pay off the remaining GBP 100 million balance on that program, which will bring our debt levels down by approximately $1.5 billion since the start of the third quarter and down by $2.3 billion since the start of this fiscal year.  
Stay tuned for a discussion of our capital allocation strategy at Investor Day.  
Okay. Let's turn to the income statement. Given the interest in the shape of the COVID-19 recovery curve, for the next couple of quarters, we will disclose sales comparisons against both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Third quarter sales were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 13.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 19.3% decrease from the same quarter in fiscal 2019, but with the important qualification that in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we began to lap the onset of the COVID-19 crisis.  
Indeed, looking at the monthly progression, measured against fiscal '19, our sales were down 23% and 14% in January, February and March, reflecting the impact of COVID across the quarter. February would have been better but for the impact of the winter storm in the U.S. during the last week of February.  
We are also disclosing today on a onetime basis that our April sales were approximately $4.4 billion, up 102.1% from prior year and improving to only down 8.8% from fiscal 2019. Our United States sales in the U.S. foodservice segment were down 5.3% versus fiscal 2019, and SYGMA was up 12% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the increase in restaurant traffic and orders as the lockdowns eased in the U.S. We will continue to benefit as the U.S. reopening advances.  
In contrast, Europe, Canada and Latin America regressed in the third quarter as a result of strict lockdowns that are now expected to continue in some cases until the end of May and as a result of slower progress in vaccination. The slower international recovery will continue to impact our fourth quarter results and may carry into early quarters of fiscal 2022, depending on vaccination progress by country.  
However, we see good news in the recent reopening taking place in the United Kingdom.  
Here are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 9.7% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 14.1%. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 77 basis points on our sales results.  
As we move down the P&L, gross profit was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, decreasing 17.2% versus same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 77 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 as our rate came in just a touch shy of 18%.  
The primary reason for the gross margin dilution is business mix. Our sales and our generally higher margin European business were down, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. Along the same lines, our sales in our lower-margin SYGMA business were up, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. We also saw a modest margin dilution in each of the business segments with varying causes from product mix shift, the timing by market of the interplay between passing along inflation and implementing our transformation initiatives.  
Adjusted operating expense decreased 14.7% to just under $1.9 billion, and we saw a modest improvement of operating expense leverage, even with lower sales to prior year. Our expense profile reflected the counterweights of good cost-out achievement, balanced against our investments for the recovery curve and our investments against the transformation agenda.  
As part of this, we targeted and achieved increased significant cost savings. We are on track to surpass our fiscal 2021 goal of $350 million of cost savings. We expect to drive continued cost savings opportunities to help fuel our future growth agenda, a topic I will discuss more at Investor Day in 2 weeks.  
Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 32% to $256 million. For the third quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 14.3% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 51.1% to $0.22 for the quarter. I'll say a few words on our third quarter results by business segment, starting with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 12.8% versus the prior year period. In the rapidly evolving environment, the business again acquired a record number of new customers as our sales teams hit the streets, and we deployed digital tools.  
We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. This business, our biggest business, is moving up the COVID recovery curve rapidly. Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the third quarter decreased 116 basis points to 37.3% of total U.S. cases, driven by customer and product mix shift. With respect to local U.S. case, the Sysco brand sales decreased 234 basis points to 44.5%, which was driven by product mix shift into prepackaged and takeaway-ready products. Regaining Sysco brand sales levels and the healthy margins that come with them will be a focus for fiscal '22 and beyond.  
Gross profit for U.S. foodservice decreased 13.7% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 16.1% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income decreased 8.3% to $525 million. Product cost inflation was 3.5% versus prior year, driven by deflationary categories in fiscal 2020.  
Moving to the SYGMA segment. For the third consecutive quarter, sales increased during the third fiscal quarter to $1.6 billion, a 15.9% increase over fiscal 2020 and a 3% increase over fiscal 2019, driven by the success of national regional quickservice restaurants servicing drive-thru traffic.  
While we are pleased with the team's efforts during COVID, SYGMA is our lowest-margin segment, and our team is carefully calibrating our efforts in that business, particularly as it relates to negotiating agreements with customers. As a result, starting during our fiscal fourth quarter, we will be taking an opportunity to transition away from a large existing regional customer. The financials of that relationship do not meet our preferred profile, and we will be focusing on freeing up capacity for more profitable customers.  
Going forward, we will continue to be diligent in our contract review and approval process across the enterprise.  
Gross profit increased 12.3% to $133 million for the quarter while gross margin was down 27 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11.1% to $121 million, and adjusted operating income increased 24.1% to $13 million all at SYGMA. 
Moving to the international segment. As I mentioned earlier, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses continue to be impacted by COVID lockdowns. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 31.3%, while gross profit decreased 35.1% and gross margin decreased 110 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of country mix, customer mix and product mix.  
For the international segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 15.8%, leading to an adjusted operating loss of $92 million. We are confident that international will be a significant recovery opportunity for our company in fiscal 2022.  
Our other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains in the COVID recovery starting blocks as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. While still in turnaround mode, the business improved its underlying profitability during the third quarter. Additionally, our Guest Worldwide business signed a substantial new customer contract during the quarter that will be very beneficial to the segment as the travel and hospitality sectors recover.  
That concludes my prepared remarks on the third quarter. We are not providing further guidance for the fourth quarter, other than to observe that we continue to monitor our operating environment carefully. While operational challenges remain for many of our customers, we are seeing excellent demand in our core business in the key markets in the center and the south. And we are seeing green shoots on the coast as markets reopen.  
Let's be clear. The upswing has begun, and we expect continued progress across the largest parts of our portfolio in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our team remains resolutely focused on driving our businesses, aggressively managing the business recovery and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. As we did in the third quarter, we will continue to deploy our balance sheet to invest in inventory, technology and our people to stay ahead of the recovery curve while also reducing our indebtedness.  
During our Investor Day in 2 weeks, Kevin and the executive leadership team will offer more detailed perspective on the business, on our growth plans for fiscal 2022 and beyond and provide further specifics on our transformation efforts. We will comment on our post-COVID capital allocation strategy, including the breadth and depth of our organic and inorganic investment plans, our plans for further debt reduction and how we're thinking about continued shareholder returns. We look forward to seeing you participate in that virtual event.

Just on the new customer prospecting, we're very proud of those results. As I said in my prepared remarks, largest single quarter ever in the history of the company from a new customer wins perspective. For those that are keeping score, I said the same thing in Q2. We actually just upped the performance that we posted in Q2. So we've got 2 consecutive quarters of record levels of new customer prospecting.  
The why is pretty straightforward: a, we made it a big priority for our sales force. We're a company that manages what we expect and we manage what we measure, and we have impact on the things that we focus upon. The second is, as I've spoken pretty openly about, we removed a barrier in our prior compensation program that got in the way of prospecting. So we changed our sales consultant compensation late last summer. It took a quarter or 2 for that to really kick in and get the change management going and get to a level of understanding of the key components of that program. And we've made it now financially beneficial for our sales consultants to prospect because it's good for us, and it's now good for them equally.  
So 2 basic reasonably simple premises, which is we've made it a priority. We're tracking it. We're measuring it. We have goals specifically by sales consultant on new customer prospecting and the financial compensation rewards them for that activity. And it obviously rewards our company as we are able to win new business profitably and grow over time.
As I said in my prepared remarks as well, it's less visible on our total top line because in many cities in this country, there are still significant restaurant restrictions. But those new customer wins are going to pay dividend and fruit for us as this recovery that we are now a part of begins to further accelerate in our Q4 and then into fiscal 2022. So we're really pleased with it.  
Second part of the question was about Restaurants Rising. Do we expect it to continue? And was it a big driver of the wins? I would say yes, that would be my point #3, which would be Restaurants Rising was a barrier that previously got in the way for a new customer coming over to Sysco. We had pretty strict and rigorous delivery days and minimums. And we've eliminated that barrier.  
Will that stay? We'll talk more about that on our May 20 Investor Day. I'm not ready this morning to make an announcement in that regard."

I would say for fiscal '22, I would expect for our independent mix to be higher for a couple of factors: one, the number of wins that we're talking about; two, and we did say this in our prepared remarks, foodservice management, hospitality, travel are down still pretty significantly and have a slower recovery curve. So I think those 2 factors put side by side would indicate that the balance of our total would be shifting. 
One counterpoint to that is one of our strongest sectors, this is our SYGMA sector, we're running double-digit increases to prior year in SYGMA. And that is margin rate dilutive because of the fact that SYGMA's our least profitable rate business. So Aaron can talk more about that on May 20. He's prepared to talk about where we're headed as a company, Ed. So those are comments for fiscal 2022. 
If I look over the longer term, our expectation is each of the sectors that we play in will recover to pre-COVID levels. They're each going to recover on a different curve, which we've tracked, and we've mapped. We're using the Technomic data to predict when that will occur. What we said from a point of optimism perspective is each of those businesses is actually ahead of schedule versus what Technomic had predicted, which is a positive harbinger of what's to come in fiscal 2022 and beyond. We expect to take share in each of those sectors. That's my best way of putting a kind of period at the end of the sentence. We have growth strategies in place for how to win in each of those sectors. So as each sector recovers and we take share, if you're asking me 2 years from now, 3 years from now, will we see a meaningfully different balance of sale by customer, I wouldn't suggest that. I would say each of the sectors will grow. And it's hard to predict 3 years from now what the precise balance of sale will be. But hopefully, post-Investor Day, there'll be more clarity to that."

You've read obviously about the restaurants themselves and how much they're struggling with filling their jobs. And then drivers, in particular, are in short supply nationwide, and frankly, in multiple countries within which we operate. 
Here's one meaningful point of difference between Sysco in, let's call it, the restaurant. Our jobs are excellent paying jobs. We do not have a wage challenge. We do not have a minimum wage challenge. Even if the nation went to a $15 minimum, we do not have pressure in that regard. Our driver jobs are excellent paying jobs, strong benefits, they're attractive positions. 
Our issue and what I spoke to you on the call today is creating awareness to those jobs. So we've had to do things in this quarter -- in the quarter we're in, Q3 and Q4, to increase advertising to create awareness. We've had to do some things, to create sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses. So the incremental expenses that I was referring to were more of that ilk than structural permanent increases to the wage, which would dilute margin. So I view this as actually a little bit more of a transitory activity where we're needing to hire over 6,000 people in our second half of our fiscal year. And there are select pockets within the country that are really tight, and we're doing some things to create awareness of our jobs. 
So we're confident in our ability to improve our profit ratio in the future. We have a cost takeout program that is substantial. That will help offset any pressures we would see in wage. We've said previously that we've taken $350 million of permanent structural cost out of our business, and that's also something that Aaron will talk about in more detail on May 20."

We are quite excited about our progress against our cost savings effort. Just to go back for a second, what we had targeted for fiscal '21 was $350 million of cost out through a combination of savings and COGS as well as in operating expen",651,"Great question. We are quite excited about our progress against our cost savings effort. Just to go back for a second, what we had targeted for fiscal '21 was $350 million of cost out through a combination of savings and COGS as well as in operating expense. We are ahead of our forecast in that respect, and we certainly expect to meet or beat our $350 million target for fiscal '21. 
I'm particularly excited this quarter because the savings are more visible than they have been in previous quarters. And at the sake of distracting us a bit, I thought, well, we might do some simple math on the call today just so I could illustrate the point of how we can see the savings having an impact on our P&L and kind of prove the point that they're real, they're there. 
And in particular, as sales go back up and we have the opportunity to have a cleaner view, it will be more obvious to everyone that we're out there. So bear with me a second, I'm going to actually walk you through some simple math.  It starts like this. To go back a year, Q3 in fiscal '20, our adjusted OpEx was $2.187 billion, sorry for the decimal points there but we've given the levels we're talking about. This quarter, the comparison period, our sales were down 13.7%. So if for the sake of argument, we assumed that our costs were fully variable -- they're not, but if we did, OpEx should have been down about $300 million. 
But Joel guided you in the past that our cost structure is 1/3 fixed and 2/3 variable. So the variable cost would have been just under $200 million of that $300 million. And we should have suffered from stranded fixed costs of $100 million absolute cost savings actions. That would have put us at $1.98 billion, right, just to continue the simple math as we push ahead. Everyone's hopefully still with me. 
Our adjusted OpEx for this quarter, though, was $1.867 billion, down $320 million, meaning not only did we reduce the variable cost consistent with sales, but we also took out $120 million of fixed costs, which is the whole point of our cost-out effort, right, being able to go quarter-over-quarter before investments, right, be able to take the fixed cost out of the structure. And the nice thing about this quarter is sales are down, and we're able to show that. 
Now I should point out a couple of other things as well. The first is that we did get, call it, $40 million of good guys that are onetime or other benefits that weren't part of the cost-out structure. What you can't see is those good guys offset $40 million to $50 million of purposeful investments we made against the recovery against the transformation in OpEx for the quarter as well. We've always committed that we are going to invest against the business. We're going to use some of the savings to advance our agenda. That's what we've done. This quarter just gives us a good example of how we can show the math, showing that it works out. 
On Investor Day, I will have more to say about cost-out. And it will talk about, really, Kelly, to the point of your -- part of your question of where is the cost-out coming from, how it's coming from the way we've restructured and regionalized our business, how it's coming from a culture of frugality that Kevin is leading, how it's coming from prioritizing our investments and insisting on business cases as we push ahead, really core discipline that you would want and how it's helping us to offset some of the trends or headlines around employee cost or inflation, et cetera, as we carry forward. 
So thanks for the question, a long answer, but I hope that's helpful."

It's definitely accelerating, but I would say that's more of a Q4 fiscal happening than it was a Q3 happening. We all read the paper every day. We're seeing what's happening not just in this industry but in eve",667,"Kelly, thank you for the inflation question. It's definitely accelerating, but I would say that's more of a Q4 fiscal happening than it was a Q3 happening. We all read the paper every day. We're seeing what's happening not just in this industry but in every industry. Certainly, the economy is becoming more inflationary. Basic economics are at play here. We have significantly increasing demand, unfortunately, simultaneous with some supply challenges that are pretty well-known out there in the food industry. 
So what is the impact of that? We are seeing sales increasing. We will most likely in our Q4 see a slightly dilutive impact on margin rate. And GP dollars, however, hopefully, would be in a growth mode, but to be determined on our ability to pass through this inflation to our customers. So here's what we're seeing, consumers, people who are actually going to the restaurants themselves, are showing a willingness to pay a higher ticket. I think you've heard other restaurant people that you personally cover talk about that. 
We are seeing restaurant partners being willing to increase their menu prices, and we're working with them. That's a part of what Sysco does. We consult with them, we teach them, we educate them on the impact of the inflation on the COGS that we are all experiencing. And we're providing suggestions on alternative product to offset the cost. And also, we're providing suggestions on where some price increases on the menu could take place. 
Important though and notable point, food-away-from-home right now is a very competitive on a price basis versus retail grocery. I think you all know that this time last year, retail grocers did a good job managing their business. And they essentially eliminated promos because they didn't need them anymore, and they are running double-digit comps. So prices at the retail grocery have gone up on a year-over-year basis. Prices actually had gone down during the COVID crisis within the menu of a restaurant. And I think we're seeing some kind of reestablishment of cost. I heard someone on Squawk this morning actually say this term, reinflation, which is last year was deflationary, and we're actually now kind of getting back to where we would have been if 2020 wouldn't have been what it was. So let's call that a catch-up. 
Last point for me, and then I'll talk about what we're doing with our customers. I do expect for the supply-to-demand equation to normalize over time, meaning suppliers will be smart and they'll ramp up demand. And then therefore, some of this inflation pressure will decrease. I just don't know how long it's going to take. What we're doing is we're closely, closely managing this. I think you know we have many contracts that if contracted, it's a percent of COGS or it's a fixed spread to COGS. And also, we have many contracts, local independent customers to be specific, where we do not have contracts. 
And Kelly, that's where today, it's mostly manual, done by our sales teams. And we're  providing guidance on how to manage it, but it's manual. To your point, the Periscope system that we are deploying will help us greatly on these types of things. We will be much more scientific and specific on how we call specific choices by category on what we want to pass through and what we don't want to pass through and then we can guarantee it is showing up in Sysco Shop in front of the customer. 
Unfortunately, as you know, we're still in the middle of that rollout. In fact, we're not in the middle. We're in the beginning part of that rollout. Since last quarter, we've expanded Periscope to 5 additional regions. And we're, in the second half of this calendar year, going to complete that rollout. So yes, Periscope will be a tremendous benefit to these types of environmental conditions in the future. It's exactly why we need the tool. Good question. Thank you for asking."

There was definitely a distributor consolidation that took place during COVID. My goal for our company will be, yes, keep it. And I'm sure that will be the goal of all of those that were winners during this market share gain that we have experienced. 
I think what you're asking, and I'll just say it pretty bluntly, the biggest players in this space have been net winners since the beginning of this pandemic. And I've been asked point blank, the question is, Kevin, you're saying -- and 2 other big companies are saying you're winning share, how can that be true? How that can be true is if you have the market share of those 3 companies. Together combined, we're less than half of the total in the marketplace. So I think the thesis remains accurate that the strongest and biggest players are succeeding during this environment, and we have no intentions of giving back the market share that we've gained. 
Things that we're doing to retain those customers, the Sysco Shop tool is becoming much easier to use, suggested orders, easy reorder button. Other customers like you are buying the following things, work we're going to talk about on Investor Day on something we're calling personalization to improve the relevance of the offers that we provide our customers.

We believe we can even further leverage our scale of our purchasing economies, our supply chain economies, and as we get better and smarter, on the promotional offers we provide to our customers. We intend to increase share of wallet and increase customer retention."

Simultaneously, we have the opportunity on what we call the tail over our assortment or inelastic SKUs to nominally increase price to be able to offset the investments we're making on the KVIs. So how we've described it in aggregate is, for the most part, margin rate will be flat constant. And this is a sales gain growth opportunity for us as we are right on price, sharper on known value items.

So I'm going to try to answer what I think was the spirit of your question, but I'll end -- I'll start with the ending, which is chains versus the local independents. The chain universe is covered pretty prolifically publicly, and I think you all know that data. Certainly, the fast food QSR space has been on fire. Anything with a chicken sandwich has been on fire. Our SYGMA sector reflects that double-digit increases to prior year from a sales perspective. 
The pleasant surprise in our Q3 and then it's accelerating in our Q4 is the strength of the local independent customer in the fully reopened markets, producing results that are above 2019. That exceeds our expectations. That exceeds Technomic's prediction by about 18 months, frankly. But there are still major geographies that are still closed. I just want to be clear about that. New York, Boston, Chicago, most of California is still confronted with major restrictions. Our European business is still dealing with major restrictions. So we're very optimistic about the health and strength of that local independent customer. It's our most profitable segment, as you well know. And when you combine just the general recovery curve of what independents are doing, coupled with our 10% increase in the number of doors that we serve, when an industry is down 10%, so we have a 20% delta, our number of unique doors versus the industry's overall performance. As we see more markets opening up, reducing restrictions, we have a strong tailwind here in front of us."

Those are the folks that work in the warehouse and then drivers. We're actually going to change the name of the driver piece to be more reflective of the work. We're actually going to start calling them delivery partners because they actually partner with our sales team to activate sales at the local level. But for now, sales consultants, selectors, drivers. 
Sales consultants, we're -- that team is just killing it out there right now, as we talked about earlier. We will be in a position of actually adding sales consultants in fiscal 2022 based on the investments we want to make in our team-based selling model. We've said publicly, and we'll talk about it more on May 20, we're going to add more specialists to be able to complement our existing broadline sales consultants. 
Warehouse selectors again, as I said a little bit earlier, we pay a very fair wage for those jobs. Those are excellent jobs. And we have a ton of hiring to do. I mentioned that we're going to hire over 6,000 people in total for our spring season. How I would describe our warehouse selectors is we're on track. We manage it day-to-day, week-to-week with hiring goals by site, by location. And we are green, meaning in a good position, green -- [ not ] red on our warehouse selector hiring. 
The more difficult job to fill at this point in time is our driver job. And it's not because of wage. As I said earlier, our wage for our driver role is terrific. It's about creating more awareness of those jobs. The overall macro impact on drivers is the age of the driver in this country is getting up there. People are retiring, and there's too few people going into that line of work. I would say I'm actually inspired by what United Airlines has done. They have the exact same problem with pilots, and they've just purchased and are going to in-source a pilot school. While I'm not announcing anything today on this call, what I would submit to all of you is Sysco is going to be very progressive and be the industry leader on creating a pipeline of drivers for our long-term success.

One is just the fill rates, as we call it, outbound to our customers, we're experiencing supplier fill rate challenges to Sysco, as are all distributors. We track it by supplier. We are very, very rigorous on our ability to improve those performance data. And for those that can't improve, we move volume from supplier A to supplier B in order to ensure that we can ship to our customers. And we are doing that aggressively right now. We partner with our suppliers. We give a joint business plan. We provide rolling forecasts. But if they can't meet our demand, we're going to find a supplier who can. 
The strength of Sysco is because of our size and our scale. We can do that work more effectively than anyone else in this space, which allows us to ship on time and in full to our customers. There are some specific unique products that are really challenging right now, chicken wings, shortening, to be specific, just to provide 2 examples. But we are doing an enormous amount of work to ensure that we can fill customers' orders. 
As it relates to on-time delivery, meaning the truck arriving within a window that our customers want, we're actually going to talk about exactly that topic on May 20. Marie Robinson, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, is doing a tremendous amount of work. We're excited about the progress that we are making to be more agile, more flexible and more customer-focused supply chain. We're bringing a mentality of customer-first to work our way back versus what's good for Sysco and fit them into our designed model. So more on that on May 20, and we're excited about talking with you about that. 
As it relates to metro versus suburban, yes, I don't think that you should draw a bright line there to say on-time rates or preferred windows are better suburban versus metro. What I would say is something I actually talked about a year ago when we put that project on pause because of COVID and now we're reinvigorating it. Small restaurants in an urban setting have really small backrooms. And they actually need more frequent delivery. And we're going to talk to you about that on May 20."

In our prepared remarks for Europe, we spoke of the fact that it is recovering slower, and it's not because of health of restaurants. It's the restrictions. I can go country by country by country if we had time. But essentially, Europe has not yet reopened. We're looking at mid-May of the earliest as to when the restrictions will begin easing with one exception. U.K. opened up outdoor dining 2 weeks ago, and you need a reservation to get an outdoor dining appointment in the U.K. It's being so warmly received. So mid-May to late May is when most of the European countries are going to begin the process of easing restrictions. So it's still a struggle in Europe, but we do anticipate a recovery. There's certainly pent-up demand in Europe for eating at restaurants. And we're confident actually that our ability to succeed in Europe is increasing, not decreasing. 
Aaron talked about one. We have a very notable FSM win in the U.K. that we've signed during this pandemic. That will pay dividend in the future when that business begins to recover. We can talk about that more in the future. 
As it relates to M&A, we're not going to comment on any M&A activity unless there was activity to comment on. I would say our European strategy is more fix the things that were broken. France, we had some self-inflicted wounds. We have used this crisis to meaningfully stabilize our performance in France. And I would describe France as we're ready now for the reopening of restaurants to be able to win back lost business and to take a significantly expanded product range and go out and start winning business.

I'm pleased to report that Sysco had a strong fourth quarter to close out a fiscal year unlike any other in our company's history. I'm proud of our team for their hard work, the results we delivered and the unrelenting support that we have provided to our customers. 
I'll start my comments today with a few key points about the quarter. First, our business recovery is stronger than anticipated in the U.S., and the recovery is taking hold in our international markets. Our sales growth exceeded our internal projections and has continued to accelerate into our Q1 of fiscal 2022. Second, our profitability for the quarter was stronger than anticipated, driven by the aforementioned strong sales and disciplined expense management. 
Third, our strong results drove improved cash performance, exceeding the cash flow guidance that Aaron provided in our last earnings call, which allowed us to pay down more debt than originally planned. Fourth, we made meaningful progress in advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. I will highlight our progress on select initiatives during our call today. 
Sysco's results for the fourth quarter reflect the strength of the overall market recovery, Sysco's ability to win new business and some early wins coming from our Recipe for Growth. Sysco's sales for the quarter across all of our businesses were up 82% versus 2020 and up 4.3% versus 2019. Our sales results in our U.S. business were up 7.7% versus 2019. Sales results in June benefited from accelerating inflation, which Aaron will discuss in detail. 
The restaurant sector of our business is near full recovery, with local sales and cases shipped up versus 2019 volume levels. The volume recovery has happened much faster than the industry predicted despite the presence of the Delta variant. The U.S. Foodservice industry in total is now within 5% of 2019 levels. As you can see on Slide 7 in our presentation, according to SafeGraph data, foot traffic is up in restaurants since March and continues to be up more than foot traffic in grocery stores. Most notably, Sysco increased market share in a rapidly expanding market. These 2 factors of a rapidly expanding market and Sysco's gaining of market share resulted in a strong sales quarter. We anticipate that these trends will accelerate further in fiscal 2022. 
Consumer spending power, as featured on Slide 8, is robust and strong. The key message is that food away from home is not permanently impaired. It is vibrant, it is healthy. Sysco is best positioned to support the rapidly increasing demand due to our balance sheet, our large physical footprint and our substantial human capital investment in salespeople and in supply chain resources. 
The momentum shown in the fourth quarter has continued in the first period of fiscal 2022 where our July results have further accelerated. We see a sequentially improving market as additional sectors of recovery kick in: international, specialty, schools and colleges, business office cafeterias, just to name a few. There is ample additional recovery beyond the robust business we are currently experiencing with restaurant partners. 
Sysco's success can be directly attributed to the proactive steps we took to be ahead of the COVID business recovery. The Net Promoter Score of our delivery operations continues to lead the industry. With that said, we are working aggressively to increase staffing levels across our operations so that we can maintain our leading service position and win additional net new business. The distributors that can ship on time and in full at this critical period have an opportunity to take market share for both the short and the long term. 
One proof point of this success is demand of net new national account wins since the onset of the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, we won another $200 million of business with national customers, bringing the cumulative total to $2 billion of net new wins since March of 2020. While we don't plan to report on this number moving forward as we transition to a more normalized financial reporting cadence, it is a strong indicator of our capabilities as the industry leader to gain share during a period of disruption. 
As you can see on Page #12 of our slides, in addition to the large national account wins we have delivered, we have grown our local customer count by about 10%, which is a pace of 2.5x greater than the broadline industry. In June, we increased our market share by 60 basis points and posted our sixth consecutive month of market share gains. Our sales force is very motivated to win. Our supply chain continues to lead the industry from a service perspective despite the substantial hiring challenges, and our Recipe for Growth strategy is beginning to benefit the business and our customers. 
Our top line results during the quarter were positively influenced by higher-than-normal inflation. During the fourth quarter, our inflation rate was approximately 9.6%. Aaron will discuss this in more detail in his prepared remarks. Our performance in the non-restaurant sectors of our business trailed the success of restaurants for the quarter. With that said, we are beginning to see improvements in the travel, hospitality and FSM sectors of our business as restrictions ease and leisure travel has commenced this summer. As businesses begin returning more to an office environment, we expect our FSM segment to further improve. 
Our international segment improved sequentially throughout the fourth quarter as restrictions on businesses began easing in late May and into June. Notably, our international segment broke even for the quarter, reflecting a $92 million profit improvement over the third quarter. The improvement displays the positive impact that increased sales and disciplined expense management will have on our international P&L. We expect to benefit significantly in fiscal 2022 from the improving international financial statements. 
I would like to take a few moments to provide an update on our Recipe for Growth transformation. Please see Slide 13 in our presentation. You will remember our introduction of the Recipe for Growth at our May 20 Investor Day. I will quickly provide an update on the main pillars of our growth strategy. Digital. Our first pillar is to become a more digitally-enabled company so that we can better serve our customers. We continue to see excellent utilization of our Sysco shop platform by our customers, and we are enhancing the website with new features and benefits every month. Our pricing system is now live in over 25% of our regions, and we remain on track to complete the implementation by the end of this calendar year. Our personalization engine, which is currently under construction, remains on track and initial manual tests of the capability with pilot customers are proving beneficial. 
Products and solutions. Our second pillar is to improve our merchandising and marketing solutions to grow our business. In this regard, our team is doing good work in developing improved merchandising strategies against specific cuisine segments. I'll speak more about the Greco acquisition in a moment and how that acquisition accelerates our efforts to better serve Italian customers. 
Supply chain. Growth pillar #3 is to develop and create a more nimble, accessible and productive supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, we are better positioned to support customers in their recovery as our supply chain network is better staffed than the industry at large. We remain the only national distributor with no order minimums for our customers at a time when competitors have been increasing their order minimums and select competitors are releasing customers who can't get those raised minimums. Lastly, our strategic projects to increase delivery frequency and enable omni-channel inventory fulfillment remains on track. 
Customer teams. Our fourth growth pillar is to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization. As we have said many times, our sales consultants are our #1 strength. The Net Promoter Scores our associates receive is the best indication of their impact on our business. Meanwhile, our efforts to better leverage data to increase the yield of our sales process are paying dividends. 
Future horizons. Our final growth pillar is to explore and develop future horizons. This work has 2 major parts: assessing new business opportunities, including M&A and becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are pleased to report that we will close on the Greco and Sons acquisition in the coming weeks. Greco's business is highly specialized in the Italian segment and brings net new capabilities and products that are accretive to Sysco. Sysco is excited to expand the Greco Italian specialty platform to new geographies across the U.S. 
As I mentioned, our future horizons work also includes our becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are making substantial investments in technology and infrastructure capabilities to strengthen the company. Our discipline across that work is funding those investments. We are on track to deliver $750 million of structural cost reductions, inclusive of what we delivered in fiscal 2021. Aaron will discuss this program in more detail in a few moments. 
As I stated at our Investor Day, the power of our Recipe for Growth comes from our ability to deliver all 5 of the growth elements that are displayed, not just from 1 key element. We believe only Sysco has the breadth, depth and expertise to leverage each of these 5 elements to better serve our customers. 
Before I wrap up my remarks this morning, I want to acknowledge the reality of the current operating environment. The food away from home supply chain is under significant pressure. A robust customer demand environment is outpacing available supply in select categories. Our supplier partners are struggling with meeting the demand of Sysco's orders, and certain product categories remain in short supply. I'm confident that Sysco is performing better than the industry at large in delivering what we call customer bill rate, but we are performing below our historical performance standards. 
Our merchant teams are working closely with current suppliers, actively sourcing incremental supply from new suppliers, and we are working with our sales teams to offer product substitutions to our customers. This work is challenging but we can execute this work better than others in this industry. I thank our suppliers for all they are doing to increase production, and I also thank our customers for their patience. 
In addition to the challenges we've experienced with product supply, the labor market has been challenging. We mentioned in the previous earnings call that we would hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of fiscal 2021. I am pleased to report that we have successfully achieved our hiring target, but we continue to have hiring needs as the business recovery is happening faster than we had modeled. It is a very tight labor market out there, and we are working extremely hard to ensure we can fill all of our warehouse and driver positions. 
While we are in decent shape nationally, we have hotspots around the country that present challenges. The product and labor shortage situation is undoubtedly putting some pressure on our cost to serve at this time. I would describe these incremental costs as mostly transitory as we are making responsible decisions on where and how to invest. I am confident we will see a return to a more balanced supply and demand equation in the future, which will return inflation to more normal levels. I cannot predict this specific by win date on inflation normalization but I am confident it will eventually normalize. In the meantime, we have robust sales results that are offsetting the margin rate pressure introduced by elevated inflation. 
In regards to labor costs, we are being very judicious to avoid creating a structural cost increase going forward. What that means specifically is that we are being very aggressive in adopting mostly temporary wage actions like hiring bonuses, referral bonuses and even retention bonus programs, all of which can be leveraged extensively while the hiring process remains challenging and then reduced or eliminated as conditions improve. 
We intend to be responsible and judicious in structural increases to base pay that cannot be easily removed when the labor market improves. We will work aggressively to offset these cost increases in wage through improved productivity. We are also taking aggressive actions to improve the labor market itself by investing in our future. I'm excited to announce today that we are investing in our first Sysco Driver Academy. The Driver Academy will enable us to recruit our own drivers and train them in the work we do at Sysco. 
We will be better able to source drivers from our own warehouse associate population and teach them to become drivers to this unique industry program. We will pay trainees to attend our Academy and will cover all of their licensing and certification fees. These associates will sign a contract to work for Sysco for an agreed-upon period of time. I'm excited for what this Driving Academy will do for our recruitment pipeline, and I believe we are likely to expand the program nationally once we have worked through the learning curve of our first location. 
In summary, we had a strong fourth quarter that exceeded our sales and profit expectations. The results during the quarter sequentially accelerated and they bode well for a successful fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we expect to achieve growth at a rate of 1.2x the industry. That rate of growth is expected to accelerate across the 3 years of our long-range plan, and we intend to deliver 1.5x the market growth in fiscal 2024. We expect to expand our leadership position while we grow profitably, and we intend to return compelling value to our shareholders. 
I want to say thank you to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed each day. The business recovery has presented challenges that our business associates have embraced head on. I thank them for their commitment and their tireless work ethic that they have displayed during this labor-constrained environment. I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our financial results, along with some additional forward-looking details for the upcoming year. Aaron, over to you."

Our key fourth quarter fiscal 2021 headlines are: strong demand, increasing sales, a profitable quarter increasingly reminiscent of pre-COVID operations and stronger cash flow than anticipated. Our fiscal fourth quarter res",2768,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Our key fourth quarter fiscal 2021 headlines are: strong demand, increasing sales, a profitable quarter increasingly reminiscent of pre-COVID operations and stronger cash flow than anticipated. Our fiscal fourth quarter results provide excellent proof points that consumers continue to seek relief from food-at-home fatigue, that the restaurant industry recovery is in full swing in the U.S. and that the international restaurant industry has the potential to come roaring back. 
During the fourth quarter, we did what we said we were going to do at Investor Day as we balance 5 financial priorities: early and tactical investments in labor and inventory to be better prepared than anyone else in the industry for the chaotic industry recovery; thoughtful strategic investments and capabilities and technologies to advance our Recipe for Growth over the long term; continued focus on our cost-out program to fund both the snapback costs and our growth agenda; accelerated reduction of our debt levels; and increased return of capital to shareholders. 
Today, I'm going to lead off with the income statement for the quarter, briefly discuss the cash flow and balance sheet, and then I will close with a positive update to our guidance for fiscal year 2022, which reflects the rapid acceleration of the recovery of our business and other factors. For full year results, I will refer you to our press release and our 10-K. 
As Kevin noted, fourth quarter sales were $16.1 billion, an increase of 82% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 4.3% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. Please note that this year, our fiscal year had a 53rd week, which included 14 weeks in the fourth quarter as compared to only 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. That additional week was worth just under $1.2 billion in sales. 
Sales in U.S. Foodservice were up 88.4% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and up 7.7% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. SYGMA was up 45.3% versus fiscal 2020 and up 20.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. For the quarter, local case volume within a subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 74.3% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 71.4%. 
Given the interest in the recovery curve from COVID-19, today, we are disclosing that our July fiscal 2022 sales were also quite strong. Sales were more than $4.9 billion, an increase of 44.3% from the same period in fiscal 2021 and a 7% increase over the same period in fiscal 2019. Kevin brought up the top of inflation. The headline is that inflation during the quarter was up 9.6% for total Sysco. Manufacturers passed inflation to us and we successfully passed it on to our customers across categories and customer types. 
Let me call out a couple of numbers and then we'll discuss our response to inflation further. Gross profit for the enterprise was $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 86.2% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year increases in sales, the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 worth about $208 million and margin rate improvement at our largest business, USFS. Gross margin as a percentage of sales during the quarter actually increased 41 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The gross margin increase was driven by business mix, with the higher-margin U.S. Foodservice businesses growing alongside improvements in higher-margin countries in our international segment. Importantly, the enterprise margin rate improvement was also driven by 17 basis points of margin rate improvement in our largest business. 
Now I'm sure you think I'm calling out the obvious when I say that in an inflationary environment, what counts at the end of the day is the health of our dollar gross profit, that which we put in the bank. The good news for us is that in the U.S., as our sales have been rising in part due to inflation, our dollar profit per case has also been increasing. Notably, in the U.S., our dollar profit per case is higher now than it was in fiscal year '19. 
You may ask, why do we have confidence that we can protect gross profit dollars in the short term and rate over time? The answer is that Sysco has some advantages. We have significant scale in purchasing, which is an asset which our suppliers will be hearing more about as we leverage the power of buying as One Sysco. In addition, the majority of our customer contracts contain cost escalation clauses. Finally, our merchandising transformation includes implementation of center-led pricing technology and other changes which allow us to navigate through the inflationary environment. 
No one tactic should be viewed in isolation, but the combination of our efforts arms us to deal with what we expect to be continued inflation in categories like poultry, beef, paper and disposables. That said, you can expect that we will be careful and tactical as we keep our eye on the real prize, execution against our Recipe for Growth. 
Let's now turn to our international business. Restrictions started to visibly ease in key jurisdictions towards the end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, international sales were up 83.4% versus fiscal 2020 but down 14.6% versus fiscal 2019. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.9% on Sysco's sales results. What we see in our largest international markets gives us additional signs of confidence for fiscal 2022. Local consumers are eager to get back to normal. And importantly, with the playbook established and significant operational change behind us, we do not expect that the reimposition of additional COVID restrictions would, if it happened, have a severe impact on our business as was the case during the past year. Just like our efforts in the U.S., the international operations have been sourcing inventory and hiring staff aggressively to move up the recovery curve. 
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense increased 44.5% to $2.3 billion, with increases driven by the variable costs that the company significantly increased volumes, onetime and short-term expenses associated with the snapback and investments against our Recipe for Growth. Our expense performance reflects the great progress we have made against our $350 million cost savings goal as well as the need to invest in both the current demand recovery and the long-term initiatives that Kevin mentioned earlier. In fact, we exceeded our $350 million cost-out goal during the full year. 
As we have highlighted in prior calls, the majority of the savings are coming from SG&A, but there are some savings from cost of goods sold as our teams continue to improve our capabilities to better optimize supplier relationships. Within operating expenses, key examples of the cost savings efforts are regionalizing first, our Broadline operations and most recently, our specialty produce operations. Other examples of areas where we achieved good cost savings would be indirect sourcing, technology cost savings and sourcing of freight contract costs. 
As I called out in Q3, we are investing heavily against the business both in support of the snapback and in support of the transformation. During the fourth quarter, we estimate that we spent more than $36 million against the snapback, including incremental investments against recruiting, training, retention and maintenance. We also estimate that we spent more than $50 million against our transformation initiatives, such as our customer-centered growth, pricing, supply chain and technology strategic initiatives. 
Even with those significant investments, our adjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales improved to 14.3% from fiscal 2020 and moved to within 30 basis points of fiscal 2019's 14% as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter. If we adjust out the purposeful snapback and transformation investments we are making as temporary, we can better see the savings as our OpEx as a percentage of sales would have been 13.8% on an adjusted basis. 
Here are a couple of points of emphasis for you. Part of the future horizon's component of our Recipe for Growth is achieving cost-out to fund the growth. We are leading with the cost-out before we make the investments. The savings are structural. We are not counting variable expense changes. Our statement's goals are owned by our entire executive leadership team. The savings are intended to increase over time. Recall that we raised our objective to $750 million, with the incremental savings coming largely over the course of fiscal '23 through fiscal '24. Kevin and I must approve all new spend on our developing capabilities that offset these savings. Remember, it is these capabilities that are generating the market share gains of 1.2x to 1.5x through fiscal 2024. All in all, we view cost-out as a good news part of our long-term story. 
Finally, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income increased $639 million to $605 million for the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.2%. Adjusted earnings per share increased $1 to $0.71 for the fourth quarter. The primary difference between our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS was the impact of our debt tender premium payment. 
As I noted at the start of my remarks, in the interest of time, I am not going to cover the full year results as part of my prepared remarks. The information is in our press release and we are happy to take questions, of course. We are pleased with the improvement each quarter as our business has recovered from the onset of COVID over the course of the last year or so. 
Let me just wrap up the income statement by observing that for the year all in, we delivered $1.02 of GAAP EPS and $1.44 of adjusted EPS. Now a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $424 million. Net CapEx for the quarter was $180 million or 1.1% of sales, which was $79 million higher compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $244 million, significantly above our anticipated free cash flow, even while we grew and maintained inventory at a level $400 million higher than Q4 fiscal '19. 
At the end of fiscal 2021, after our investments in the business, our significant reductions in debt and our dividend payments, we had $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. During the year, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion offset by $412 million of net capital investment, resulting in positive free cash flow of $1.5 billion for the year. As you know, at Investor Day, we articulated our debt paydown plans: $2.3 billion of deleveraging already accomplished during the fiscal year through May 2021; plans for an additional $1.5 billion of further debt reductions by the end of fiscal year '22. Because we have sized the headline on our Q4 tender offer to $1 billion, we are already tracking $150 million ahead of our debt repurchase commitments. 
Lastly, we returned almost $1 billion of capital to shareholders in fiscal year '21 in the form of our quarterly dividends. We were pleased to announce at Investor Day a $0.02 per share increase to our dividend, on which we made the first payment in July. This brings our dividend to $1.88 per share for the full calendar year 2022 and enhances our track record of increasing our dividends and our status as a dividend aristocrat. That concludes my prepared remarks on the quarter and year-end results. 
Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some updated guidance for fiscal year 2022. In May, I laid out our growth aspiration of growing at 1.2 to 1.5x the market. Also recall that we said, in fiscal year '22, we expected adjusted EPS of $3.23 to $3.43. We also called out that in fiscal year '24, we expect adjusted EPS of 30% more than our high points in fiscal year 2019, call it more than $4.65. Our projections and guidance were tied to the Technomic market projections as they existed at the time. 
Frankly, the speed of recovery of consumer demand has been nothing short of remarkable. We are seeing the positive impact broadly across our business. Sales are recovering more quickly than we or the market trend experts anticipated. That means that to hit our 1.2x market growth in fiscal year 2022, we have to grow faster and we are. As a result, we are raising our sales expectations and now expect sales for the enterprise to exceed fiscal '19 sales by mid-single digits, adding roughly $2.5 billion to our top line guidance. 
Every segment of our business other than our other segment and the FSM component of our USFS business is now forecast to exceed fiscal '19 sales by the end of fiscal year '22. Inflation is more of a factor than we had anticipated for the first half of fiscal '22, and we expect it to continue into the first half of our new year. But our business is proving that it can pass along at least the increases necessary to preserve dollar per case profit. As a result, while margin rate may be weaker than originally expected in the first half of the fiscal year, we expect strong gross profit dollars growing with sales and are holding to our Investor Day guidance that gross margins will improve over fiscal '21 and move toward fiscal '19 levels for the full year. 
Regarding the cost-out program, we are working it aggressively. We expect to invest most of the fiscal '22 savings into the snapback, including the transitory incremental costs that Kevin discussed earlier and important transformational initiatives. From a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2022 as we are not assuming changes to federal tax rates in this guidance. 
And based on the early strength of the recovery that Kevin mentioned during his remarks, as impacted by inflation and our continued progress against managing through the snapback and investing for growth, we are increasing our guidance on adjusted EPS by $0.10 for fiscal year 2022 by moving the range up to $3.33 to $3.53. 
Now let's be clear, no one can forecast the unknown. The Delta variant is out there, and our updated guidance does not bake in a shutdown case. We are providing this guidance based on what we can see in our business right now, and we will follow with further updates, positive or negative, as the environment evolves around us and we continue to execute against the transformation and the snapback. 
In addition, with rising sales comes an increase in operating cash flow. We continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation strategy that we highlighted at Investor Day. First, investing in our business for long-term growth and increasing our industry-leading position. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately 1.3% of sales, reflecting the increased sales levels. We continue to look for further sources of smart inorganic growth as we laid out at Investor Day. Second, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and expect to hit our announced net debt-to-EBITDA target during fiscal year '22. 
And finally, recall that in May, we announced the conditions to the initiation of share repurchase, resulting from the new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Here they are: the market recovery must be robust. That is happening. The investments in the business must be fully funded, including M&A. We expect to have more than adequate capital for our planned investments. Our debt reduction must continue and our investment-grade rating must be preserved. As I discussed, we are ahead of schedule on reductions of debt and expect to hit our leverage target toward the end of the year. 
Excess liquidity must exist to fund the repurchase program. It is early days, but with the accelerating recovery, we anticipate available cash to exceed our earlier forecast. Applying the criteria we announced in May, if business trends continue, then we will consider options to return more capital in fiscal '22. However, having said those words out loud, I want to be clear, our decision tree is based on our balanced capital allocation strategy. 
In summary, our performance over the past year has been strong, and the fundamentals of our business are solid as we look to the coming year. We are excited about the future as we kick off fiscal year 2022. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Our July results, as we communicated on the call, continued the sequential momentum of increased sales and case performance, and we are not seeing a slowdown in our performance in the month of July. I don't like commenting on what others are doing. I don't think that's my place. I think it is public knowledge that select distributors are, in fact, raising order minimums.

Those would be the 2 places that the customer would go."

And so long as we can pass it through and we have proven in the last quarter that we expect to be able to pass it through. Kevin already called out that we were high single digits from an inflation perspective in Q4 really across our categories, and we are forecasting that will continue certainly into Q1 of our new fiscal, if not the first half and then moderate thereafter. 
It's also important to point out that we're dealing with a 2-year stack. Fiscal 2020 was actually modestly deflationary and so we're reacting to that. And I just want to point out again that given our scale, given the advantages we have, right, we have been successful and expect to be successful in passing through whatever inflation throws at us by commodity type as we carry forward."

We believe in a cautious and pragmatic approach to our financial guidance to Wall Street. The practical reality is that there's a lot going on, right, with the continued COVID recovery as well as the significant transformation that Kevin is leading across Sysco. And so both as we laid out during our Investor Day in May and now with this update 90 days later, we're taking a cautious and pragmatic approach to it. 
Things that could change, of course, is the speed of the recovery curve, right? It could accelerate or moderate, right? We're taking the best view we've got in the business as we are today. Similarly, from a profitability perspective, we have talked about our significant cost-out objectives, balancing out the snapback costs as well as the investments we're making in the transformation. And so we believe that the guidance range we've provided today, the $3.33 and the $3.53 is a cautious and pragmatic update to the guidance we provided at Investor Day, and that's what we're going to go get done."

So I'm just wondering, Kevin, maybe your thoughts versus the start of COVID, whether you'd say there's any positive or negative surprises. I think you gave us some color around the $2 billion of adding new accounts, so that 1 seems pretty successful.

I'll just cover kind of the 3 sources of growth and just repeat a couple of key messages, add a little bit of additional commentary. Yes, from a national sales wins perspective, we posted an additional substantial quarter, net $200 million additional on top of what we've already won, so that's more than $2 billion of net business in the national sales. We're not going to report that number going forward. That's something that we were doing during COVID to give a sense of confidence on what was happening kind of under the water because the overall water level was lower than what it should have been because of COVID, but we're going to pause going forward on reporting on that. 
But we had another great quarter and we don't anticipate that slowing down. We have the ability to continue to win national contract business. The why is that those customer types have tremendous confidence in Sysco's breadth, depth and expertise to be able to ship on time and in full. I get asked the question all the time, why are you winning on the national sales basis? It is not because of rates. We do not underbid the market to try to win new business. We bid appropriate market rates, and we win because of our service experience and our capabilities of our national sales team to represent Sysco in a compelling way. So that trend has continued. 
I would say the surprise, and it's a very pleasant and positive one for the industry at large and also for Sysco, is that the independent restaurant customer who is predicted to go out of business just simply has not. We are shipping 10% more unique doors than we were pre-COVID. And that factoid alone conveys the health of the independent customer, but it also conveys that Sysco has won big in net new customers in the independent space because the industry is down about 10%, so we have a 20-point delta in our performance versus the industry at large and the ability to serve that customer type. 
The why that has occurred is because we have changed our compensation model for our sales reps. We make it worth their while now to more significantly prospect new customers, and we have improved the customer onboarding process in a meaningful way. And we've eliminated order minimums, which eliminates, again, another barrier of our new customer joining our mix. 
I would say in regards to customer lines of penetration, that's something that our Recipe for Growth is going to address in spades, and I anticipate additional momentum on cases per operator in fiscal 2022, and that gives Aaron and I the confidence in the guidance that we just provided. As it relates to acquisitions, we're proud and pleased. Very soon, we will be closing on the Greco acquisition. It's a terrific business focused on the Italian segment, unique products, unique service model, delivery frequency that is substantial and we're going to grow that platform. We believe that there are additional acquisitions out there that are tuck-in fold in. We do not have plans at this time to do any substantial M&A."

That is the fact, that is the headline. We can't predict the future. We do not know if things will change. If governments choose to impact dining, on-prem dining, that would have an impact. That is not in our forecast because we can't predict whether that will occur or not occur. 
What I can, I guess, provide from a color perspective is the country of France has been pretty aggressive with implementing a vaccination passport to be required to eat on -- at a restaurant, and we're prepared to execute against that and we're working very closely, obviously, with our French operations to be ready for that, that goes into effect in about a month. 
I would say there are some that take the position that, that vaccine passport will increase people's confidence in going out to eat. There are others that suggest that it might have a foot traffic impact. I guess I would put forward to those 2 things offset each other and it's a wash. I don't know is the honest answer. And many of you live in New York and know that New York has communicated a similar vaccine passport, which will be leveraged in Manhattan. 
It's too soon to tell. What we can say at this point in time is Delta is not having an impact on our business trends. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're prepared. Aaron said this well. If, in fact, there were some form of a government shutdown, we're prepared to execute against it. We have the ability to execute against it. And I just want to reemphasize 1 other positive. We've got sectors that of our business that haven't yet moved up the recovery curve that will be doing so as schools come back online, both K-12 and college in a more meaningful way. When we compare to 2020, for sure, that will be a positive. 
And then as companies return to work, and I know select companies have announced a delay of that, but many companies are, in fact, returning to work post Labor Day, that's another tailwind to our business because we partner with FSM providers as the lead distributor of food to those types of companies. And that is another potential tailwind, along with leisure and business travel picking up in our hospitality segment. So there's a lot in there. That's why we have provided the forecast that we have provided, going back to Jeff's question, why not more aggressive because we can't predict the unknown. What we can see are the trends that we have, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on the forecast update we provided today. I'll toss to Aaron for any additional commentary."

The good news is we've declared we would hire over 6,000 people in the first -- excuse me, second half of our fiscal 2021, which is the first half of this calendar year, and we succeeded. We hit that target. We are in decent shape nationally. We are definitely in better shape than the industry at large. 
The good news/challenge is that the recovery is happening faster than we had modeled and that is a good thing for the P&L and it puts pressure on our hiring. We absolutely have incremental drivers and warehouse selectors to be hired. We are working very aggressively to do that. We're moving any and all obstacles that get in the way: recruiting bonuses, retention bonuses. We are increasing the number of recruiters that we have. We're doing marketing to create awareness of what are very high-quality, high-paying jobs. And we are -- we literally have a daily standup when we talk every day about our staffing health. 
Neil and I talked about this last night. We have 76 warehouses in just the United States alone, which is by far the biggest count in this industry. And we have a handful of sites that are in a challenged status. However, we have the vast majority of our sites that are not and we have buffer capacity. So as a single building has challenges, we can flex product demand and volume to all locations. And if you're a smaller company, you just don't have that flex capacity. We have 300 warehouses across the globe. And it's just the breadth and depth and scale of this company in times like this that give us advantage. 
We're working very hard. This is the #1 priority for our company is to increase our staffing health, as I call it. There's more new business to be had and more incremental business to be had as we improve our staffing health and we're committed to doing it.

And what others say may be inconsistent and different than what we say. All I'm going to describe is the realities at Sysco, what we're doing, I encourage you to go back to our prepared remarks. I was really careful and thoughtful about how we characterized it. But I will give you additional color and also be as crisp as I can possibly be about what's going on. 
In our Q4, and it's definitely continued into July, we are spending money on what I call a transitory basis to improve our staffing health. Those things are retention bonuses, hiring bonuses, recruitment bonuses. We're compensating our sales consultants to help us find drivers that are out in the industry. Those expenses are in our P&L in Q4, and we had a very solid quarter because the sales growth we are experiencing is more than covering those ""transitory incremental costs."" 
And we will continue to do those things until the staffing health gets to our level of satisfaction. Where we will be judicious, prudent and careful is in structural wage permanent cost increases. We will do it if we have to but we will only do it if we have to. And the why is, as you well know, and in your models, this is why you're asking us this question, you live with those costs forever and they're compounding. I guess, trust that I've come from an industry that had labor shortages for more than a decade and experienced substantial cost increases, that's the pharmacy industries that doesn't -- those that don't know me well enough. And we will be extremely prudent to prevent that from happening in this industry. 
With that said, we will have to make some investments in base pay because the market has moved on us in select locations, and we're prepared to move so that we don't find ourselves in a position of disadvantage. What I said in my prepared remarks, however, is, and we will find productivity improvement offsets to offset those cost increases that are, in fact, structural and permanent because Aaron and I can see in our business where and how we can be more efficient. So even if there's some wage increase as a percent of sales, we can run our trucks more efficiently to reduce miles delivered on an annual basis as just an example to find offsets. Aaron, I'll toss to you if there's anything you want to say about 2022 from a cost perspective."

So yes, there is more upside as we improve our health. And we've worked to incorporate those types of thoughts into our forward-facing logic, which Aaron has covered. You asked how long will it take to get back to a healthier position. I would say it's within the next 6 months is when we can definitively say we are in a better, healthier position than we are right now. It's the most challenging labor market I've experienced in my career. That is fact. But we do believe we are in a better position. 
We do believe to answer one of your discrete questions, can Sysco expand its leadership position? The answer is yes, definitively. We believe we can expand our leadership position. How much additional upside is out there is something I'd prefer not to comment upon. You offered an interesting query about Delta slowdown as a potential 2 things offsetting each other.

The increased inflation is not dampening demand at this point in time. Our restaurant partners are succeeding in making their own menu price adjustments. The consumer pent-up demand on eating away from home is in the robust consumer spending power that exists out there. 
That's why the elevated inflation, which would normally be problematic, I think we've kind of trained the industry and trained ourselves at 2% to 3% inflation is a healthy zone and above that becomes challenging. This is a unique time, and the elevated inflation that we're experiencing is not decreasing demand. And because of that, while it's having a slightly negative impact on our gross margin rate percentage, we are definitely putting more gross profit dollars in the bank, and therefore, it helped us with a strong quarter. 
To your point, if it continued forever, that would be problematic. And we are working to answer the second part of your question very aggressively with our supplier partners. Are their alternative products, different cuts of meat? As I mentioned, this is a fast poultry and pork problem, most aggressively at this point in time. And you know that from the coverage of the universe. And we're working really hard to find incremental sources of supply. We believe that is our responsibility for our customers to help decrease COGS over time. And Judith Sansone and our merchant team are working extraordinarily hard to help us reduce COGS so that we can provide great value to our customers and, therefore, continue successful, profitable growth for both them and for us. Aaron, anything you want to add to that?"

I would actually take the view of the industry recovering much faster than what we expected, could put pressure on that 1.2x, but we are not communicating anything other than we are fully committed to delivering that level of growth. The total, for sure, will be higher for 2022 than what we originally thought, which is why Aaron announced today a lift of $2.5 billion of incremental sales.

We have a specific identified list of strategic initiatives that are tied to our transformation for which there are specific business cases, which lead to the ROI over time that comes from sales and the profit that comes from the incremental sales that result from them. So when I talk transformation investments, it's the spend against those initiatives in the quarter. 
In contrast, the snapback expenses, we are very carefully monitoring that which we believe to be onetime or short term or transitory in nature. And it goes to, are we paying recruiting firms more money? Are we doing more recruiting marketing than we were doing before? Are we doing incremental training because of the velocity of new associates we have in coming into our buildings? Are we paying retention, et cetera? And that's what you will find within those -- within that disclosure.

Followed by how are we supporting our customers the most directly? 
Reflecting our growth aspirations, you're right, there will be areas where we will need to invest in marketing and merchandising, in other areas as well.

In fact, we will add sales reps over time and we are going to increase delivery frequency to our customers over time. So the cost-out is not variable. It's permanent, it's structural. 
You have, for example -- some examples. We sold a corporate headquarters that we determined we didn't need because we have more people working from home than we had previously. That's just the asset sale and it reduced our operating expenses. We restructured our field organization to become more efficient, more agile, more lean and to be more center-led from a strategy perspective. And that work is done. It's in the rearview mirror and those costs are permanent. They're structural, never moved. 
And we've got many other examples but it's -- and Aaron covered 1 other in his prepared remarks, which is indirect sourcing.

I'm proud of our team for their hard work",2378,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'm pleased to report that Sysco had a strong fourth quarter to close out a fiscal year unlike any other in our company's history. I'm proud of our team for their hard work, the results we delivered and the unrelenting support that we have provided to our customers.
I'll start my comments today with a few key points about the quarter. First, our business recovery is stronger than anticipated in the U.S., and the recovery is taking hold in our international markets. Our sales growth exceeded our internal projections and has continued to accelerate into our Q1 of fiscal 2022. Second, our profitability for the quarter was stronger than anticipated, driven by the aforementioned strong sales and disciplined expense management. Third, our strong results drove improved cash performance, exceeding the cash flow guidance that Aaron provided in our last earnings call, which allowed us to pay down more debt than originally planned. Fourth, we made meaningful progress in advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. I will highlight our progress on select initiatives during our call today.
Sysco's results for the fourth quarter reflect the strength of the overall market recovery, Sysco's ability to win new business and some early wins coming from our Recipe for Growth. Sysco's sales for the quarter across all of our businesses were up 82% versus 2020 and up 4.3% versus 2019. Our sales results in our U.S. business were up 7.7% versus 2019. Sales results in June benefited from accelerating inflation, which Aaron will discuss in detail.
The restaurant sector of our business is near full recovery with local sales and cases shipped up versus 2019 volume levels. The volume recovery has happened much faster than the industry predicted despite the presence of the Delta variant. The U.S. foodservice industry in total is now within 5% of 2019 levels. As you can see on Slide 7 in our presentation, according to SafeGraph data, foot traffic is up in restaurants since March and continues to be up more than foot traffic in grocery stores. Most notably, Sysco increased market share in a rapidly expanding market. These 2 factors of a rapidly expanding market and Sysco's gaining of market share resulted in a strong sales quarter. We anticipate that these trends will accelerate further in fiscal 2022.
Consumer spending power, as featured on Slide 8, is robust and strong. The key message is that food away from home is not permanently impaired. It is vibrant. It is healthy. Sysco is best positioned to support the rapidly increasing demand due to our balance sheet, our large physical footprint and our substantial human capital investment in salespeople and in supply chain resources.
The momentum shown in the fourth quarter has continued in the first period of fiscal 2022 where our July results have further accelerated. We see a sequentially improving market as additional sectors of recovery kick in: international, specialty, schools and colleges, business office cafeterias, just to name a few. There is ample additional recovery beyond the robust business we are currently experiencing with restaurant partners.
Sysco's success can be directly attributed to the proactive steps we took to be ahead of the COVID business recovery. The Net Promoter Score of our delivery operations continues to lead the industry. With that said, we are working aggressively to increase staffing levels across our operations so that we can maintain our leading service position and win additional net new business. The distributors that can ship on time and in full at this critical period have an opportunity to take market share for both the short and the long term.
One proof point of this success is demand of net new national account wins since the onset of the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, we won another $200 million of business with national customers, bringing the cumulative total to $2 billion of net new wins since March of 2020. While we don't plan to report on this number moving forward as we transition to a more normalized financial reporting cadence, it is a strong indicator of our capabilities as the industry leader to gain share during a period of disruption.
As you can see on Page #12 of our slides, in addition to the large national account wins we have delivered, we have grown our local customer count by about 10%, which is a pace of 2.5x greater than the broadline industry. In June, we increased our market share by 60 basis points and posted our sixth consecutive month of market share gains. Our sales force is very motivated to win. Our supply chain continues to lead the industry from a service perspective despite the substantial hiring challenges, and our Recipe for Growth strategy is beginning to benefit the business and our customers. Our top line results during the quarter were positively influenced by higher-than-normal inflation. During the fourth quarter, our inflation rate was approximately 9.6%. Aaron will discuss this in more detail in his prepared remarks. 
Our performance in the non-restaurant sectors of our business trailed the success of restaurants for the quarter. With that said, we are beginning to see improvements in the travel, hospitality and FSM sectors of our business as restrictions ease, and leisure travel has commenced this summer. As businesses begin returning more to an office environment, we expect our FSM segment to further improve.
Our international segment improved sequentially throughout the fourth quarter as restrictions on businesses began easing in late May and into June. Notably, our international segment broke even for the quarter, reflecting a $92 million profit improvement over the third quarter. The improvement displays the positive impact that increased sales and disciplined expense management will have on our international P&L. We expect to benefit significantly in fiscal 2022 from the improving international financial statements.
I would like to take a few moments to provide an update on our Recipe for Growth transformation. Please see Slide 13 in our presentation. You will remember our introduction of the Recipe for Growth at our May 20 Investor Day. I will quickly provide an update on the main pillars of our growth strategy. 
Digital. Our first pillar is to become a more digitally enabled company so that we can better serve our customers. We continue to see excellent utilization of our Sysco Shop platform by our customers, and we are enhancing the website with new features and benefits every month. Our pricing system is now live in over 25% of our regions, and we remain on track to complete the implementation by the end of this calendar year. Our personalization engine, which is currently under construction, remains on track, and initial manual tests of the capability with pilot customers are proving beneficial.
Products and solutions. Our second pillar is to improve our merchandising and marketing solutions to grow our business. In this regard, our team is doing good work in developing improved merchandising strategies against specific cuisine segments. I'll speak more about the Greco acquisition in a moment and how that acquisition accelerates our efforts to better serve Italian customers.
Supply chain. Growth pillar #3 is to develop and create a more nimble, accessible and productive supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, we are better positioned to support customers in their recovery as our supply chain network is better staffed than the industry at large. We remain the only national distributor with no order minimums for our customers at a time when competitors have been increasing their order minimums and select competitors are releasing customers who can't get those raised minimums. Lastly, our strategic projects to increase delivery frequency and enable omnichannel inventory fulfillment remains on track. 
Customer teams. Our fourth growth pillar is to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization. As we have said many times, our sales consultants are our #1 strength. The Net Promoter Scores our associates receive is the best indication of their impact on our business. Meanwhile, our efforts to better leverage data to increase the yield of our sales process are paying dividends.
Future horizons. Our final growth pillar is to explore and develop future horizons. This work has 2 major parts: assessing new business opportunities, including M&A; and becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are pleased to report that we will close on the Greco and Sons acquisition in the coming weeks. Greco's business is highly specialized in the Italian segment and brings net new capabilities and products that are accretive to Sysco. Sysco is excited to expand the Greco Italian specialty platform to new geographies across the U.S.
As I mentioned, our future horizons work also includes our becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are making substantial investments in technology and infrastructure capabilities to strengthen the company. Our discipline across that work is funding those investments. We are on track to deliver $750 million of structural cost reductions, inclusive of what we delivered in fiscal 2021. Aaron will discuss this program in more detail in a few moments.
As I stated at our Investor Day, the power of our Recipe for Growth comes from our ability to deliver all 5 of the growth elements that are displayed, not just from 1 key element. We believe only Sysco has the breadth, depth and expertise to leverage each of these 5 elements to better serve our customers.
Before I wrap up my remarks this morning, I want to acknowledge the reality of the current operating environment. The food-away-from-home supply chain is under significant pressure. A robust customer demand environment is outpacing available supply in select categories. Our supplier partners are struggling with meeting the demand of Sysco's orders, and certain product categories remain in short supply. I'm confident that Sysco is performing better than the industry at large in delivering what we call customer bill rate, but we are performing below our historical performance standards. Our merchant teams are working closely with current suppliers, actively sourcing incremental supply from new suppliers, and we are working with our sales teams to offer product substitutions to our customers. This work is challenging, but we can execute this work better than others in this industry. I thank our suppliers for all they are doing to increase production, and I also thank our customers for their patience.
In addition to the challenges we've experienced with product supply, the labor market has been challenging. We mentioned in a previous earnings call that we would hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of fiscal 2021. I am pleased to report that we have successfully achieved our hiring target, but we continue to have hiring needs as the business recovery is happening faster than we had modeled. It is a very tight labor market out there, and we are working extremely hard to ensure we can fill all of our warehouse and driver positions.
While we are in decent shape nationally, we have hotspots around the country that present challenges. The product and labor shortage situation is undoubtedly putting some pressure on our cost to serve at this time. I would describe these incremental costs as mostly transitory as we are making responsible decisions on where and how to invest. I am confident we will see a return to a more balanced supply-and-demand equation in the future which will return inflation to more normal levels. I cannot predict the specific by when date on inflation normalization, but I am confident it will eventually normalize. In the meantime, we have robust sales results that are offsetting the margin rate pressure introduced by elevated inflation.
In regards to labor costs, we are being very judicious to avoid creating a structural cost increase going forward. What that means specifically is that we are being very aggressive in adopting mostly temporary wage actions, like hiring bonuses, referral bonuses and even retention bonus programs, all of which can be leveraged extensively while the hiring process remains challenging and then reduced or eliminated as conditions improve. We intend to be responsible and judicious in structural increases to base pay that cannot be easily removed when the labor market improves. We will work aggressively to offset these cost increases in wage through improved productivity. 
We are also taking aggressive actions to improve the labor market itself by investing in our future. I'm excited to announce today that we are investing in our first Sysco Driver Academy. The Driver Academy will enable us to recruit our own drivers and train them in the work we do at Sysco. We will be better able to source drivers from our own warehouse associate population and teach them to become drivers to this unique industry program. We will pay trainees to attend our academy, and we'll cover all of their licensing and certification fees. These associates will sign a contract to work for Sysco for an agreed-upon period of time. I am excited for what this Driving Academy will do for our recruitment pipeline, and I believe we are likely to expand the program nationally once we have worked through the learning curve of our first location.
In summary, we had a strong fourth quarter that exceeded our sales and profit expectations. The results during the quarter sequentially accelerated, and they bode well for a successful fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we expect to achieve growth at a rate of 1.2x the industry. That rate of growth is expected to accelerate across the 3 years of our long-range plan, and we intend to deliver 1.5x the market growth in fiscal 2024. We expect to expand our leadership position while we grow profitably, and we intend to return compelling value to our shareholders. I want to say thank you to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed each day. The business recovery has presented challenges that our business associates have embraced head-on. I thank them for their commitment and their tireless work ethic that they have displayed during this labor-constrained environment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our financial results, along with some additional forward-looking details for the upcoming year. Aaron, over to you."

Our fiscal fourth quarter re",2769,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Our key fourth quarter fiscal 2021 headlines are strong demand; increasing sales; a profitable quarter, increasingly reminiscent of pre-COVID operations; and stronger cash flow than anticipated. Our fiscal fourth quarter results provide excellent proof points that consumers continue to seek relief from food-at-home fatigue, that the restaurant industry recovery is in full swing in the U.S. and that the international restaurant industry has the potential to come roaring back.
During the fourth quarter, we did what we said we were going to do at Investor Day as we balance 5 financial priorities: early and tactical investments in labor and inventory to be better prepared than anyone else in the industry for the chaotic industry recovery; thoughtful strategic investments and capabilities and technologies to advance our Recipe for Growth over the long term; continued focus on our cost-out program to fund both the snapback costs and our growth agenda; accelerated reduction of our debt levels; and increased return of capital to shareholders.
Today, I'm going to lead off with the income statement for the quarter, briefly discuss the cash flow and balance sheet, and then I will close with a positive update to our guidance for fiscal year 2022, which reflects the rapid acceleration of the recovery of our business and other factors. For full year results, I will refer you to our press release and our 10-K.
As Kevin noted, fourth quarter sales were $16.1 billion, an increase of 82% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 4.3% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. Please note that this year, our fiscal year had a 53rd week, which included 14 weeks in the fourth quarter as compared to only 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. That additional week was worth just under $1.2 billion in sales.
Sales in U.S. Foodservice were up 88.4% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and up 7.7% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. SYGMA was up 45.3% versus fiscal 2020 and up 20.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. For the quarter, local case volume within a subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 74.3%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 71.4%. Given the interest in the recovery curve from COVID-19, today, we are disclosing that our July fiscal 2022 sales were also quite strong. Sales were more than $4.9 billion, an increase of 44.3% from the same period in fiscal 2021 and a 7% increase over the same period in fiscal 2019. 
Kevin brought up the top of inflation. The headline is that inflation during the quarter was up 9.6% for total Sysco. Manufacturers passed inflation to us, and we successfully passed it on to our customers across categories and customer types. Let me call out a couple of numbers, and then we'll discuss our response to inflation further. 
Gross profit for the enterprise was $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 86.2% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year increases in sales; the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 worth about $208 million; and margin rate improvement at our largest business, USFS. 
Gross margin as a percentage of sales during the quarter actually increased 41 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The gross margin increase was driven by business mix with the higher-margin U.S. Foodservice businesses growing alongside improvements in higher-margin countries in our international segment. Importantly, the enterprise margin rate improvement was also driven by 17 basis points of margin rate improvement in our largest business.
Now I'm sure you think I'm calling out the obvious when I say that in an inflationary environment, what counts at the end of the day is the health of our dollar gross profit, that which we put in the bank. The good news for us is that in the U.S., as our sales have been rising, in part, due to inflation, our dollar profit per case has also been increasing. Notably, in the U.S., our dollar profit per case is higher now than it was in fiscal year '19.
You may ask, ""Why do we have confidence that we can protect gross profit dollars in the short term and rate over time?"" The answer is that Sysco has some advantages. We have significant scale in purchasing, which is an asset which our suppliers will be hearing more about as we leverage the power of buying as One Sysco. In addition, the majority of our customer contracts contain cost escalation clauses. Finally, our merchandising transformation includes implementation of center-led pricing technology and other changes which allow us to navigate through the inflationary environment. No one tactic should be viewed in isolation, but the combination of our efforts arms us to deal with what we expect to be continued inflation in categories like poultry, beef, paper and disposables. That said, you can expect that we will be careful and tactical as we keep our eye on the real prize: execution against our Recipe for Growth. 
Let's now turn to our international business. Restrictions started to visibly ease in key jurisdictions towards the end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, international sales were up 83.4% versus fiscal 2020 but down 14.6% versus fiscal 2019. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.9% on Sysco's sales results. What we see in our largest international markets gives us additional signs of confidence for fiscal 2022. Local consumers are eager to get back to normal. And importantly, with the playbook established and significant operational change behind us, we do not expect that the reimposition of additional COVID restrictions would, if it happened, have a severe of an impact on our business as was the case during the past year. Just like our efforts in the U.S., the international operations have been sourcing inventory and hiring staff aggressively to move up the recovery curve.
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense increased 44.5% to $2.3 billion with increases driven by the variable costs that the company significantly increased volumes, onetime and short-term expenses associated with the snapback and investments against our Recipe for Growth. Our expense performance reflects the great progress we have made against our $350 million cost-out savings goal as well as the need to invest in both the current demand recovery and the long-term initiatives that Kevin mentioned earlier. In fact, we exceeded our $350 million cost-out goal during the full year.
As we have highlighted in prior calls, the majority of the savings are coming from SG&A, but there are some savings from cost of goods sold as our teams continue to improve our capabilities to better optimize supplier relationships. Within operating expenses, key examples of the cost savings efforts are regionalizing first our Broadline operations, and most recently, our specialty produce operations. Other examples of areas where we achieved good cost savings would be indirect sourcing, technology cost savings and sourcing of freight contract costs.
As I called out in Q3, we are investing heavily against the business, both in support of the snapback and in support of the transformation. During the fourth quarter, we estimate that we spent more than $36 million against the snapback, including incremental investments against recruiting, training, retention and maintenance. We also estimate that we spent more than $50 million against our transformation initiatives, such as our customer-centered growth, pricing, supply chain and technology strategic initiatives.
Even with those significant investments, our adjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales improved to 14.3% from fiscal 2020 and moved to within 30 basis points of fiscal 2019's 14% as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter. If we adjust out the purposeful snapback and transformation investments we are making as temporary, we can better see the savings as our OpEx as a percentage of sales would have been 13.8% on an adjusted basis.
Here are a couple of points of emphasis for you. Part of the future horizon's component of our Recipe for Growth is achieving cost-out to fund the growth. We are leading with the cost-out before we make the investments. The savings are structural. We are not counting variable expense changes. Our statement's goals are owned by our entire executive leadership team. The savings are intended to increase over time. Recall that we raised our objective to $750 million with the incremental savings coming largely over the course of fiscal '23 through fiscal '24. Kevin and I must approve all new spend on our developing capabilities that offset these savings. Remember, it is these capabilities that are generating the market share gains of 1.2x to 1.5x through fiscal 2024. All in all, we view cost-out as a good news part of our long-term story.
Finally, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income increased $639 million to $605 million for the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.2%. Adjusted earnings per share increased $1 to $0.71 for the fourth quarter. The primary difference between our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS was the impact of our debt tender premium payment. 
As I noted at the start of my remarks, in the interest of time, I am not going to cover the full year results as part of my prepared remarks. The information is in our press release, and we are happy to take questions, of course. We are pleased with the improvement each quarter as our business has recovered from the onset of COVID over the course of the last year or so.
Let me just wrap up the income statement by observing that for the year all-in, we delivered $1.02 of GAAP EPS and $1.44 of adjusted EPS. 
Now a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $424 million. Net CapEx for the quarter was $180 million or 1.1% of sales, which was $79 million higher compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $244 million, significantly above our anticipated free cash flow, even while we grew and maintained inventory at a level $400 million higher than Q4 fiscal '19.
At the end of fiscal 2021, after our investments in the business, our significant reductions in debt and our dividend payments, we had $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. During the year, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion, offset by $412 million of net capital investment, resulting in positive free cash flow of $1.5 billion for the year. 
As you know, at Investor Day, we articulated our debt paydown plans: $2.3 billion of deleveraging already accomplished during the fiscal year through May 2021; plans for an additional $1.5 billion of further debt reductions by the end of fiscal year '22. Because we have sized the headline on our Q4 tender offer to $1 billion, we are already tracking $150 million ahead of our debt repurchase commitments. 
Lastly, we returned almost $1 billion of capital to shareholders in fiscal year '21 in the form of our quarterly dividends. We were pleased to announce at Investor Day a $0.02 per share increase to our dividend, on which we made the first payment in July. This brings our dividend to $1.88 per share for the full calendar year 2022 and enhances our track record of increasing our dividends and our status as a dividend aristocrat. That concludes my prepared remarks on the quarter and year-end results. 
Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some updated guidance for fiscal year 2022. In May, I laid out our growth aspiration of growing at 1.2 to 1.5x the market. Also recall that we said, in fiscal year '22, we expected adjusted EPS of $3.23 to $3.43. We also called out that in fiscal year '24, we expect adjusted EPS of 30% more than our high points in fiscal year 2019, call it more than $4.65. Our projections and guidance were tied to the Technomic market projections as they existed at the time. Frankly, the speed of recovery of consumer demand has been nothing short of remarkable. We are seeing the positive impact broadly across our business. Sales are recovering more quickly than we or the market trend experts anticipated. That means that to hit our 1.2x market growth in fiscal year 2022, we have to grow faster, and we are. As a result, we are raising our sales expectations and now expect sales for the enterprise to exceed fiscal '19 sales by mid-single digits, adding roughly $2.5 billion to our top line guidance.
Every segment of our business, other than our other segment and the FSM component of our USFS business, is now forecast to exceed fiscal '19 sales by the end of fiscal year '22. Inflation is more of a factor than we had anticipated for the first half of fiscal '22, and we expect it to continue into the first half of our new year. But our business is proving that it can pass along at least the increases necessary to preserve dollar per case profit. As a result, while margin rate may be weaker than originally expected in the first half of the fiscal year, we expect strong gross profit dollars growing with sales and are holding to our Investor Day guidance that gross margins will improve over fiscal '21 and move toward fiscal '19 levels for the full year. 
Regarding the cost-out program, we are working it aggressively. We expect to invest most of the fiscal '22 savings into the snapback, including the transitory incremental costs that Kevin discussed earlier and important transformational initiatives. From a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2022 as we are not assuming changes to federal tax rate in this guidance. And based on the early strength of the recovery that Kevin mentioned during his remarks, as impacted by inflation and our continued progress against managing through the snapback and investing for growth, we are increasing our guidance on adjusted EPS by $0.10 for fiscal year 2022 by moving the range up to $3.33 to $3.53.
Now let's be clear, no one can forecast the unknown. The Delta variant is out there, and our updated guidance does not bake in a shutdown case. We are providing this guidance based on what we can see in our business right now, and we will follow with further updates, positive or negative, as the environment evolves around us, and we continue to execute against the transformation and the snapback.
In addition, with rising sales comes an increase in operating cash flow. We continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation strategy that we highlighted at Investor Day. First, investing in our business for long-term growth and increasing our industry-leading position. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately 1.3% of sales, reflecting the increased sales levels. We continue to look for further sources of smart inorganic growth as we laid out at Investor Day. Second, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and expect to hit our announced net debt-to-EBITDA target during fiscal year '22. 
And finally, recall that, in May, we announced the conditions to the initiation of share repurchase, resulting from the new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Here they are: the market recovery must be robust. That is happening. The investments in the business must be fully funded, including M&A. We expect to have more than adequate capital for our planned investments. Our debt reduction must continue, and our investment-grade rating must be preserved. As I discussed, we are ahead of schedule on reductions of debt and expect to hit our leverage target toward the end of the year. Excess liquidity must exist to fund the repurchase program. It is early days, but with the accelerating recovery, we anticipate available cash to exceed our earlier forecast. Applying the criteria we announced in May, if business trends continue, then we will consider options to return more capital in fiscal '22. However, having said those words out loud, I want to be clear: Our decision tree is based on our balanced capital allocation strategy. 
In summary, our performance over the past year has been strong, and the fundamentals of our business are solid as we look to the coming year. We are excited about the future as we kick off fiscal year 2022. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Our July results, as we communicated on the call, continue the sequential momentum of increased sales and case performance, and we are not seeing a slowdown in our performance in the month of July. 
I don't like commenting on what others are doing. I don't think that's my place. I think it is public knowledge that select distributors are, in fact, raising order minimums. And they are, in fact, deciding to not ship to select customers. Where that customer goes, it would be a combination of a distributor that has the availability to ship and cash and carry. Those would be the 2 places that the customer would go."

Kevin already called out that we were high single digits from an inflation perspective in Q4, really, across our categories, and we are forecasting that will continue certainly into Q1 of our new fiscal, if not the first half, and then moderate thereafter.
It's also important to point out that we're dealing with a 2-year stack. Fiscal 2020 was actually modestly deflationary, and so we're reacting to that. And I just want to point out again that, given our scale, given the advantages we have, right, we have been successful and expect to be successful in passing through whatever inflation throws at us by commodity type as we carry forward. Thank you."

Things that could change, of course, is the speed of the recovery curve, right? It could accelerate or moderate, right? We're taking the best view we've got in the business as we are today. Similarly, from a profitability perspective, we have talked about our significant cost-out objectives, balancing out the snapback costs as well as the investments we're making in the transformation.

I'll just cover kind of the 3 sources of growth and just repeat a couple of key messages, add a little bit of additional commentary. Yes, from a national sales wins perspective, we posted an additional -- substantial quarter",536,"Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll just cover kind of the 3 sources of growth and just repeat a couple of key messages, add a little bit of additional commentary. Yes, from a national sales wins perspective, we posted an additional -- substantial quarter, net $200 million additional on top of what we've already won. So that's more than $2 billion of net business in the national sales. To be clear, we're not going to report that number going forward. That's something that we were doing during COVID to give a sense of confidence on what was happening kind of under the water because the overall water level was lower than what it should have been because of COVID, but we're going to pause, going forward, on reporting on that. 
But we had another great quarter, and we don't anticipate that slowing down. We have the ability to continue to win national contract business. The why is that those customer types have tremendous confidence in Sysco's breadth, depth and expertise to be able to ship on time and in full. I get asked the question all the time, ""Why are you winning on the national sales basis?"" It is not because of rates. We do not ""underbid"" the market to try to win new business. We bid appropriate market rates, and we win because of our service experience and our capabilities of our national sales team to represent Sysco in a compelling way. So that trend has continued.
I would say the surprise, and it's a very pleasant and positive one for the industry at large and also for Sysco, is that the independent restaurant customer who is predicted to go out of business just simply has not. We are shipping 10% more unique doors than we were pre-COVID, and that factoid alone conveys the health of the independent customer, but it also conveys that Sysco has won big in net new customers in the independent space because the industry is down about 10%, so we have a 20-point delta in our performance versus the industry at large and the ability to serve that customer type.
The why that has occurred is because we have changed our compensation model for our sales reps. We make it worth their while now to more significantly prospect new customers, and we have improved the customer onboarding process in a meaningful way. And we've eliminated order minimums, which eliminates, again, another barrier of our new customer joining our mix.
I would say in regards to customer lines of penetration, that's something that our Recipe for Growth is going to address in spades, and I anticipate additional momentum on cases per operator in fiscal 2022, and that gives Aaron and I the confidence in the guidance that we just provided. As it relates to acquisitions, we're proud and pleased. Very soon, we will be closing on the Greco acquisition. It's a terrific business focused on the Italian segment, unique products, unique service model, delivery frequency that is substantial, and we're going to grow that platform. We believe that there are additional acquisitions out there that are tuck-in, fold-in. We do not have plans at this time to do any substantial M&A."

That is the fact. That is the headline. We can't predict the future. We do not know if things will change. If governments choose to impact dining, on-prem dining, that would have an impact. That is not in our forecast because we can't predict whether that will occur or not occur. 
What I can, I guess, provide from a color perspective is the country of France has been pretty aggressive with implementing a vaccination passport to be required to eat on -- at a restaurant, and we're prepared to execute against that. And we're working very closely, obviously, with our French operations to be ready for that. That goes into effect in about a month. I would say there are some that take the position that, that vaccine passport will increase people's confidence in going out to eat. There are others that suggest that it might have a foot traffic impact. I guess I would put forward that those 2 things offset each other, and it's awash. 
I don't know is the honest answer. And many of you live in New York and know that New York has communicated a similar vaccine passport which will be leveraged in Manhattan. It's too soon to tell. What we can say at this point in time is Delta is not having an impact on our business trends. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're prepared. Aaron said this well. If, in fact, there were some form of a government shutdown, we're prepared to execute against it. We have the ability to execute against it. 
And I just want to reemphasize one other positive. We've got sectors that -- of our business that haven't yet moved up the recovery curve that will be doing so as schools come back online, both K-12 and college, in a more meaningful way. When we compare to 2020, for sure, that will be a positive. And then as companies return to work, and I know select companies have announced a delay of that, but many companies are, in fact, returning to work post Labor Day, that's another tailwind to our business because we partner with FSM providers as the lead distributor of food to those types of companies. And that is another potential tailwind, along with leisure and business travel picking up in our hospitality segment. 
So there's a lot in there. That's why we have provided the forecast that we have provided. Going back to Jeff's question, why not more aggressive? It's because we can't predict the unknown. What we can see are the trends that we have, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on the forecast update we provided today. 
I'll toss to Aaron for any additional commentary."

The good news is we've declared we would hire over 6,000 people in the first -- excuse me, second half of our fiscal 2021, which is the first half of this calendar year, and we succeeded. We hit that target. We are in decent shape nationally. We are definitely in better shape than the industry at large. The good news/challenge is that the recovery is happening faster than we had modeled, and that is a good thing for the P&L, and it puts pressure on our hiring. We absolutely have incremental drivers and warehouse selectors to be hired. We are working very aggressively to do that. We're moving any and all obstacles that get in the way: recruiting bonuses, retention bonuses. We are increasing the number of recruiters that we have. We're doing marketing to create awareness of what are very high-quality, high-paying jobs. And we are -- we literally have a daily standup where we talk every day about our staffing health. 
Neil and I talked about this last night. We have 76 warehouses in just the United States alone, which is, by far, the biggest count in this industry. And we have a handful of sites that are in a challenged status. However, we have the vast majority of our sites that are not, and we have buffer capacity. So as a single building has challenges, we can flex product demand and volume to all locations. And if you're a smaller company, you just don't have that flex capacity. We have 300 warehouses across the globe, and it's just the breadth and depth and scale of this company in times like this that give us advantage.
We're working very hard. This is the #1 priority for our company is to increase our staffing health, as I call it. There's more new business to be had and more incremental business to be had as we improve our staffing health, and we're committed to doing it.

And what others say may be inconsistent and different than what we say. All I'm going to describe is the realities at Sysco, what we're doing. I encourage you to go back to our prepared remarks. I was really careful and thoughtful about how we characterized it, but I will give you additional color and also be as crisp as I can possibly be about what's going on. 
In our Q4, and it's definitely continued into July, we are spending money on what I call the transitory basis to improve our staffing health. Those things are retention bonuses, hiring bonuses, recruitment bonuses. We're compensating our sales consultants to help us find drivers that are out in the industry. Those expenses are in our P&L in Q4, and we had a very solid quarter because the sales growth we are experiencing is more than covering those ""transitory"" incremental costs. And we will continue to do those things until the staffing health gets to our level of satisfaction. 
Where we will be judicious, prudent and careful is in structural wage permanent cost increases. We will do it if we have to, but we will only do it if we have to. And the why is, as you well know, and in your models, this is why you're asking us this question, you live with those costs forever, and they're compounding. I guess trust that I've come from an industry that had labor shortages for more than a decade and experienced substantial cost increases, that's the pharmacy industries that doesn't -- those that don't know me well enough. And we will be extremely prudent to prevent that from happening in this industry. 
With that said, we will have to make some investments in base pay because the market has moved on us in select locations, and we're prepared to move so that we don't find ourselves in a position of disadvantage. What I said in my prepared remarks, however, is -- and we will find productivity improvement offsets to offset those cost increases that are, in fact, structural and permanent because Aaron and I can see in our business where and how we can be more efficient. So even if there's some wage increase as a percent of sales, we can run our trucks more efficiently to reduce miles delivered on an annual basis as just an example to find offsets. 
Aaron, I'll toss to you if there's anything you want to say about 2022 from a cost perspective."

So yes, there is more upside as we improve our health. And we've worked to incorporate those types of thoughts into our forward-facing logic, which Aaron has covered. You asked how long will it take to get back to a healthier position. I would say it's within the next 6 months is when we can definitively say we are in a better, healthier position than we are right now. It's the most challenging labor market I've experienced in my career. That is fact, but we do believe we are in a better position. 
We do believe to answer one of your discrete questions: Can Sysco expand its leadership position? The answer is yes, definitively. We believe we can expand our leadership position. How much additional upside is out there is something I'd prefer not to comment upon. 
You offered an interesting query about Delta slowdown as a potential -- 2 things offsetting each other. I would just repeat, we're not seeing a Delta headwind at this point in time. This is not in our actuals that we are seeing a Delta headwind. The thing that would impact the business is if governments put restrictions back on operators, and let's be optimistic that, that won't be necessary.

The increased inflation is not dampening demand at this point in time. Our restaurant partners are succeeding in making their own menu price adjustments. The consumer pent-up demand on eating away from home is -- and the robust consumer spending power that exists out there. That's why the elevated inflation which would normally be problematic. I think we've kind of trained the industry and trained ourselves that 2% to 3% inflation is a healthy zone, and above that becomes challenging. This is a unique time, and the elevated inflation that we're experiencing is not decreasing demand. And because of that, while it's having a slightly negative impact on our gross margin rate percentage, we are definitely putting more gross profit dollars in the bank. And therefore, it helped us with a strong quarter. 
To your point, if it continued forever, that would be problematic, and we are working to answer the second part of your question very aggressively with our supplier partners. Are their alternative products, different cuts of meat? As I mentioned, this is a fast poultry and pork problem, most aggressively at this point in time, and you know that from the coverage of the universe. And we're working really hard to find incremental sources of supply. We believe that is our responsibility for our customers to help decrease COGS over time. And Judith Sansone and our merchant team are working extraordinarily hard to help us reduce COGS so that we can provide great value to our customers and therefore continue successful, profitable growth for both them and for us. 
Aaron, anything you want to add to that?"

Both Aaron and I did a caveat that as the market grows faster, we need to grow faster, too. And if the market underperformed versus those forecasts, we commit we will grow 1.2x.
I would actually take the view of the industry recovering much faster than what we expected, could put pressure on that 1.2x, but we are not communicating anything other than we are fully committed to delivering that level of growth. The total, for sure, will be higher for 2022 than what we originally thought, which is why Aaron announced today a lift of $2.5 billion of incremental sales.

In contrast, the snapback expenses, we are very carefully monitoring that which we believe to be onetime or short term or transitory in nature, and it goes to are we paying recruiting firms more money?

They will go to how do we operate as an ongoing concern the most efficiently, followed by how are we supporting our customers the most directly.
Reflecting our growth aspirations, you're right. There will be areas where we will need to invest in marketing and merchandising and areas as well. But if we take the list of cost initiatives, we believe that it enables the growth objective we have out there, and it is specifically actionable as we move through the period of time.

Just nothing that we're doing in our cost-out will hinder our ability to serve our customers. In fact, we will add sales reps over time, and we are going to increase delivery frequency to our customers over time. So the cost-out is not variable. It's permanent. It's structural. 
You have, for example -- some examples. We sold a corporate headquarters that we determined we didn't need because we have more people working from home than we had previously. That's just the asset sale, and it reduced our operating expenses. We restructured our field organization to become more efficient, more agile, more lean and to be more center-led from a strategy perspective. And that work is done. It's in the rearview mirror, and those costs are permanent. They're structural, never moved.

Our sequential improvement in sales and volume is a clear statement of our supply chain strength and our ability to win meaningful market share in this climate. We are pleased with the top line results, and our flow-through to the bottom line exceeded our expectations for the quarter. This strong start gives us confidence in reaffirming our guidance for the full year. 
Key headlines for the quarter include a growing top line that improved sequentially throughout the quarter and continued growth through October, as seen on the right side of Slide 4. Q1 represented another period of strong net new business wins for Sysco at both the national and local level. These customer wins will fuel our success in quarters and years to come. Customers are responding to Sysco's relative supply chain strength, our new purpose platform and our improving capabilities driven by our Recipe for Growth strategy. All told, we delivered sales growth of 8.2% versus 2019. 
We outperformed our fiscal 2022 growth goal of 1.2x the market in the first quarter, delivering the strongest growth versus the market in the last 5-plus years. We believe additional growth is still in front of us at Sysco as our volume is yet to fully recover in certain segments, such as hospitality, business and industry, foodservice management and international. As these segments recover, additional momentum will be added to our business. We are preparing now for select segments to further recover in early 2022 by strategically placing inventory and bolstering our staffing levels. For example, we anticipate that our business and industry segment will see upward momentum in January as select customers plan to reopen their offices at that time. International travel restrictions are beginning to ease, which should benefit our hospitality selector in specific regions of our business. 
Our operational expenses for the quarter increased due to higher volumes, elevated overtime rates and in intentional expenditures that were targeted to improve our staffing health. We invested in incremental marketing to advertise open positions. We provided new associates with sign-on bonuses and provided referral and retention bonuses to existing staff. We anticipate that these expenses will continue in our second quarter and that we can make progress in reducing the level of investment in the second half of our fiscal year. Our profit flow-through from the top to the bottom line should improve as a result in the second half. 
Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by a high rate of inflation, which increased to approximately 13%. We expect inflation to continue at a similar rate through the second quarter before beginning to taper later in the fiscal year. Given current trends in the industry, we expect the tapering will begin further into the fiscal year than we had initially modeled. 
Our international business continues to show strong improvement. We have improved from posting a loss in Q3 of 2021 to breaking even in Q4 to making more than $60 million of adjusted profit in our Q1 of fiscal 2022. It is important to note that our international business is skewed to large contract customers that are still heavily impacted by COVID. For example, we over-indexed in Europe in the business, industry and travel segments that remain constrained versus 2019 levels. As such, the relative sales performance in the international sector still lags that of the U.S. segment. However, it also conveys that we have additional recovery still in front of us internationally. Our Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our international business segment to improve how we serve local customers over time, and we anticipate a shift in our customer mix to the more profitable local sector as we progress on our 3-year strategic plan. 
In summary, we delivered very strong top line results, increased profit per case shipped and experienced elevated operating expenses that increased our cost to serve. The combination of these results delivered a strong adjusted operating income for the quarter of $685 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. Both results exceeded our expectations for the quarter and position Sysco to deliver our full year guidance. Aaron will provide more details on our financials shortly, but we are pleased to be off to a strong start in the new fiscal year. 
Topic 2, let's turn to our business transformation, which is highlighted on Slide 5. As important as our strong quarterly financial results, our business transformation remains on track, and I will highlight a few examples of our progress this morning. Our pricing project implementation is now substantially complete. The centralized pricing tool enables Sysco to strategically manage the high levels of inflation we are currently experiencing with disciplined and strategic control. We can determine, at the customer item level, exactly what level of inflation to pass through. We can optimize the pass-through to balance profitability and sales growth. There is no better time than the present to have this powerful capability. Longer term, the pricing tool will enable us to accelerate sales growth profitably as we optimize pricing to increase share of wallet and increase pricing trust with our customers. 
Our work on the personalization engine continues to advance. This innovative industry-leading program will enable Sysco to further penetrate lines and cases with existing customers and will improve our sales consultants' ability to win new accounts. We will supplement personalization with increased service levels for top customers through an innovative loyalty program that we will discuss more in future quarterly calls. 
Our sales transformation is proving to be very successful as our sales teams continue to win new business at record levels. As I mentioned in my financial narrative, our local and national sales teams delivered strong wins in the quarter that will help fuel our future growth profitably. Lastly, we are continuing to improve the efficiency of our organization as we further reduce our structural expenses to fund our strategic initiatives. Over the past few quarters, we regionalized the leadership structure of our specialty businesses, FreshPoint and SSMG, and we followed the playbook of our U.S. Broadline regionalization and have now implemented the more agile and efficient model for our 2 main specialty businesses. 
As shown on Slide 6, during our first quarter, we successfully closed on the Greco and Sons transaction, which we expect to deliver over $1 billion in incremental sales to Sysco in fiscal 2022, ahead of our deal model expectations. More importantly, we plan to leverage the Greco business model to build a nationwide Italian platform that is the best in the industry, which will further deliver incremental sales beyond the $1 billion just mentioned. 
In addition to closing the Greco transaction, we acquired a produce distributor in October that will operate as a part of our FreshPoint business segment and will improve our ability to provide fresh produce and value-added fresh-cut capabilities to the Pennsylvania and Ohio markets. You may not realize that Sysco is the largest specialty produce distributor in the United States vis-à-vis our FreshPoint platform. Our produce business has a high-growth CAGR and attractive margins. Growing in the specialty sector is a priority for Sysco, enabling us to gain more share of wallet from customers by combining our broadline capabilities with the premium service levels, selling skills and product assortment availability of specialty. 
Our Recipe for Growth is still in the very early innings, but we can see the benefits of our developing capabilities and the new customers we are winning and the progress that we are making in market share gains. Importantly, our first quarter results exceeded our 1.2x market share growth target for fiscal 2022. More importantly, as the Recipe for Growth matures, the impact on our top line growth will accelerate. As such, we remain committed to growing profitably 1.5x the market as we exit our fiscal 2024. 
Topic 3 for today is an update on the state of the business. During our last earnings call, I highlighted the critical importance of staffing health due to the supply chain challenges that are well documented across all industries. As covered on bullets on Slide 7, we have made progress throughout this quarter in improving our staffing levels. Our leadership team, top to bottom, has been extraordinarily focused on improving our staffing health. A good example of our efforts is the execution of our first-ever nationwide hiring event in the second week of October. We leveraged extensive digital marketing and a streamlined hiring process to net more than 1,000 new supply chain associates to bolster our troops. When coupled with our year-to-date hiring success, we are making solid progress on increasing our throughput capacity. 
Additionally, during the quarter, we opened our first Driver Academy. Our first academy classes in session, as we say at Sysco and we are training our next generation of Sysco drivers. We are bullish on expanding this program across the country in the coming year, and we are confident it will make a meaningful difference in generating a solid driver pipeline. 
From a product availability perspective, although our fill rates still lag our historical standards, we were able to deliver a higher fill rate to customers than the industry average. We have strong relationships with our key suppliers and a merchant team that is extremely focused on finding and sourcing product substitutions. I have personally engaged with top suppliers to ensure a solid partnership with Sysco, and I am cautiously optimistic that our suppliers' performance will improve through the remainder of the year and into our fiscal 2023. Supplier improvement will be a key to improving customer fill rate and customer satisfaction. 
Lastly, you may have seen the recent announcement regarding the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's requirements for employers with 100 or more employees. I am pleased to inform you that Sysco began a weekly COVID testing regimen in September, and as such, we are already compliant with the majority of the OSHA's stated guidelines. The safety of our associates and our customers is our #1 priority and we remain steadfast in protecting our team. 
In summary, Sysco continues to lead the industry in how we are supporting our customers during this challenging supply chain environment. Our Net Promoter Scores are outperforming the broadline distribution industry and our ability to serve customers remains best-in-class. We remain the only national distributor without system-wide minimum orders, and we will endeavor to increase the flexibility and service that we provide our customers in the coming quarters and years. 
The impact of our relative supply chain success can be seen in our results. We sequentially increased sales throughout the quarter and expanded our market share capture. We now have more than 10 consecutive months of gaining market share, and we are on track to deliver our stated goal for the year, growing 1.2x the industry and our Recipe for Growth strategy will enable us to accelerate over the next 3 years and grow at 1.5x the industry by the end of our fiscal year 2024. 
I want to thank all of our associates for their tremendous hard work over the past quarter as Sysco experienced unprecedented growth and supply chain challenges. We are winning in the marketplace and that would not have been possible without the dedication of our sales, logistics and merchandising teams. I'm honored to serve these associates and work by their side. I'll now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter before we open it up for questions. Aaron, over to you."

Our strong first quarter fiscal 2022 financial headlines are: growing demand, with sales exceeding Q1 fiscal 2019 by 8.2%; a profitable quarter, exceeding our plans with EBITDA comparable to pre-COVID 2019 levels; aggressive investment by Sysco against a hiring snapback, allowing Sysco to lead the industry in otherwise turbulent times; purposeful investments in working capital to continue to lead in product availability; a strong return to profitability by our international business; and great progress against our balanced capital allocation strategy, including continued investments against the 5 pillars of our Recipe for Growth and upgrade to BBB of our investment-grade rating by S&P; the elimination of all debt covenant restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or increase our dividend in the future; and a decision that we are announcing today, namely that we have satisfied our internal criteria to commence share repurchase. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we will begin our repurchase of up to $500 million of shares over the course of this fiscal year. 
During today's call, I'm going to cover the income statement and cash flow for the quarter, and then I will close with some observations on our guidance for fiscal 2022. First quarter sales were $16.5 billion, an increase of 39.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and an 8.2% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice were up 46.5% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and up 11.6% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. 
SYGMA was up 11.8% versus fiscal 2021 and up 5.1% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. You will recall that in SYGMA, the increase in sales in the quarter is more modest because of the purposeful transition-out of an unprofitable customer, which we announced in our third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and because during the quarter, some consumers are switching from their favorite QSR drive-up back to some of the excellent sit-down restaurants served by our more profitable U.S. Foodservice segment. Local case volume, within a subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 23.8%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 28.1%. 
With respect to our international business, restrictions continue to ease across our international operations in the first quarter. International sales were up 34% versus fiscal 2021 while also improving sequentially over prior quarters to down less than 1% versus fiscal 2019, indicating that we have more upside to come. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1% on Sysco's sales results. Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 13%. The good news is that we continue to manage our profitability well in the inflationary environment. 
Let me call out a couple of numbers and then we'll discuss inflation further. Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the first quarter, increasing 33.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 2%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021, and compared to both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments. That's a real sign of health in our business. 
While it is gross profit dollars that count, inflation did impact our gross margin rates for the enterprise during the quarter as it decreased 79 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2021 and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The rate was flat sequentially with Q4 of fiscal 2021. The gross margin decline versus the prior year was driven by accelerating inflation and margin changes at our higher-margin U.S. businesses, with the larger USFS businesses growing volume at lower margin rates. 
We continue to manage the inflationary pressures with both our suppliers and our customers and, thus far, have not seen much pushback on our ability to pass along pricing. In addition, the fact that we are now substantially complete in our rollout of our Periscope pricing system means that we have more tools than ever before to manage our profitability while being right on price. 
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense came in at $2.3 billion, with expense increases from the prior year driven by 3 things: first, the variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes; second, more than $57 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback; and third, more than $24 million of operating expense investments for our Recipe for Growth. Together, the snapback investments and the transformation costs totaled approximately $81 million of operating expense this quarter and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.12. 
Even with those significant snapback and transformation operating expense investments, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 13.9%, an almost 200 basis point improvement from fiscal 2021 and a 64 basis point improvement from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. Doing the simple math, if we removed the transitory snapback investments and the transformation investments I referenced earlier, total OpEx would have been at 13.4% of sales. That is a real sign of the power of our earlier cost-out efforts. To repeat what we said before, during fiscal 2022, our cost-out helps us to cover snapback and transformation costs. 
Finally, for the first fiscal quarter, adjusted operating income increased $320 million from last year to $685 million, putting us basically on par with adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019, even with the snapback investments and the transformation investments. This was primarily driven by a 58% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and strong profitability from international. Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.49 to $0.83 for the first quarter. Perhaps pointing out the obvious, if we extract the $51 million of incremental interest expense, we are carrying in Q1 of fiscal 2022, resulting from the COVID-related precautionary bonds we issued in 2020, our adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2022 would have been more in line with our pre-COVID adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2019. If you go a step further and exclude both the interest expense and the $81 million of snapback and transformation costs, you really begin to see why we believe that in the long term, Sysco has significant earnings potential. 
Now let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $111 million during the first quarter as we responded to rising sales and purposely invested in inventory in support of managing product availability during the snapback better than the industry. We also purposely invested in longer-lead inventory to support customers such as K-12 schools and health care facilities during the snapback, consistent with Sysco's purpose statement. We also saw manageable changes in receivables levels that we expected to accompany rising sales and arising from the mix of business as Sysco executes its Recipe for Growth. 
Our net CapEx spend was $79.4 million and is ramping up as teams submit business cases for investments against the Recipe for Growth. We will manage those investments over the course of our 3-year plan to ensure our growth. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $31 million. At the end of the first quarter, after our investments in the business, payments of the acquisition price for Greco and our dividend payments, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
In May, we committed to supporting a strong investment-grade credit rating with a targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x, which we continue to expect to hit by the end of fiscal 2022. Later this year, we plan to pay off the $450 million of notes due in June of 2022, and may, should the circumstances warrant it, take further action against our debt portfolio. S&P recently acknowledged the progress against our leverage ratio by upgrading us to BBB flat. 
We also paid our increased dividend of $0.47 per share in July and again in October. Given that we paid our increased dividend starting in July, consistent with our status as a dividend aristocrat, we expect to next address decisions around our dividend per share sometime during calendar year 2022. As I mentioned earlier, we plan to commence share repurchase activity under the $5 billion share repurchase authority we announced in May at Investor Day beginning in the second quarter. As I stated a moment ago, that will take the form of the repurchase of up to $500 million of shares by the end of the fiscal year. 
That concludes my prepared remarks on the fiscal first quarter. Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2022. As Kevin highlighted, we expect to continue to grow at or above 1.2x the market in fiscal 2022. We are operating in a dynamic environment with significant inflation. While we do expect inflation to moderate by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, it may take longer to taper than originally anticipated, though it is hard to predict. We expect to pass through the vast majority of our COGS inflation. 
We are assuming continued heavy snapback and transformation investments in Q2 at levels at least equal to the investments in Q1. We are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the year. Fiscal 2022 EPS will be in the range of $3.33 to $3.53, reflecting the $0.10 increase that we called out last quarter. As always, our EPS guidance does not assume changes to the federal tax rate. All in all, we have confidence for the rest of the year. 
In summary, we've had a solid quarter and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We are excited about the future as we continue to advance Sysco's Recipe for Growth. Operator, we're now ready for questions."

As I said in the prepared remarks, we made a lot of progress in the quarter. We are definitely leading the industry from a health of staffing perspective and health of the supply chain, which is what's enabling us to win market share. And what I would say is the situation steadily improved through the quarter. 
August, I would submit, is probably our toughest spot of the calendar year from a staffing perspective as our volume was really recovering and our staffing needs were most significant. In September, 23 states opened up, the government supplemental benefits were retired and we did see an increase in applicant flow. We actually weren't anticipating that because our base pay wages are well above the $15 per hour breakeven component. Our selectors get paid in the mid-$20s, our drivers get paid in the mid-$30s. We weren't expecting an improvement tied to that, but we did experience an improvement in September tied to the retiring of those benefits. 
Most notably or even more importantly, we've gotten a lot better at recruiting, hiring and training of our staff. We're really pleased with the efforts to digitize our marketing efforts tied to our open jobs. We've streamlined the hiring process. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we conducted our first-ever nationwide, not every single site in the country, hiring event and netted over 1,000 people joining our team in just 1 week alone, which was a big progress for us. So we're doing really well from a recruitment perspective. 
To answer your question specifically, as I said in my remarks, we have not had to resort to ""meaningful"" base pay change, the vast majority of the expenses that we are putting forth are what we call transitory or 2-way doors. You can go through them you can turn around, you can come back. So what does that mean?  Hiring bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses, advertising. We are spending money in places like Facebook to advertise the awareness and creation of visibility to these jobs. 
Aaron called out that those expenditures will continue into Q2. And then we will have the opportunity to begin to taper some of those investments because they're transitory. We've had select locations, a very small number of them, that we did a wage review and needed to make some adjustments, but that was not meaningful or material for Sysco. Aaron wants to add something, toss to him."

It's the national sales and business we've just done extraordinarily well with winning new business. And to be crystal clear, this isn't a guns or butter choice.

So we're really pleased with top line, strong, compelling, continued growth fueled by a recovering market but even more fueled by our market share capture. 
As I said in my prepared remarks, we're growing at more than 1.2x the market, which is the highest rate of growth at Sysco in more than 5 years. The sectors that are still constrained versus '19, that's the language that I would use: travel and hospitality, for sure; foodservice; management; international, as I called out on my prepared remarks; and there's some softness in health care vis-à-vis long-term care tied to COVID, which is the new starts or new bed patients, as they call them, are constrained. 
We're not concerned about health care for the long term. With the aging of America. They call this tsunami. We actually view health care as a growth opportunity for our company for the longer term. We see the opposite of what you just said, Alex. We see our customers contacting us in the travel and industry and business in travel and hospitality, excuse me, and business and industry sectors gearing up for what they believe to be a January step-up in volume. And mostly, that's driven by corporations that have been mostly working from home beginning the process of bringing their employees back to work in January. 
We do very well in that space, partnering with foodservice management companies. And we're working right now to preposition inventory to be prepared from a staffing perspective. As far as rolling over tough comp compares for holiday season, that's not something we're concerned about. Aaron wants to add something. Aaron, over to you."

Is it possible to quantify what you think is being left on the table associated with that? 
And then that kind of gets into the second part of my question, which is that, is it also possible to talk about where some of the segments are kind of running versus 2019? And I ask all this because your case volume is still modestly below '19 in the U.S., which is obviously understandable. But I'm kind of curious as to what all of this is saying about where your case volume can be, let's call it, by the end of this fiscal year or so or early next year when life is obviously hopefully a lot more normal. So any color that you could add there would be super helpful, I think."

My language that I used in the prepared remarks is we're performing better than the industry average, and that is the most accurate descriptor of our performance. We are below our historical fill rate standards. We set a very high bar for ourselves, ship on time and ship in full and we are below our historical standards. The why is that our inbound fill rate from our suppliers to us is well below our historical standards. Our output to our customers is actually significantly higher than the inbound fill rate to Sysco, and the how and why behind that is the work we do to find substitutes to bridge customers to alternative products. 
And that's what's creating the relative strength of Sysco versus others is the good work our merchant teams are doing to find product substitutions. I think your question is more like, is there even more sales to be had if fill rates improve? I would say, yes. How long it will take for a fill rate to improve is subject for debate. So what we're doing because we want to take ownership of what we can directly control is to be even better at managing fill rate. 
So we're improving our website to provide dynamic visibility to out-of-stocks and provide suggestions at point-of-sale to the customer on things that can be bought alternatively. And our sales teams and merchandising teams, when we find ourselves, as I mentioned earlier, in a situation of long-term outs are being very proactive, providing quick selling bulletins to our sales teams, digital marketing pushes to our customers, including e-mails on suggesting to them alternatives and the like. 
So it's a core strength of our company. I meaningfully desire for the inbound fill rate to Sysco to improve. We're working very closely with our suppliers on that. And we think it will improve but not quickly. It's going to be kind of a sequential steady slow improvement in fill rate into our fiscal 2023. 
As it relates to volume in the second part of your question, what I would say is we expect at the end of our fiscal Q3 to be back to 2019 from a volume perspective. And we have segments that will be at that level in Q2 of this fiscal year. So within our existing fiscal year, we will be back to 2019 volume levels. I'm not going to break it down by segment. It's not something I'm prepared to do this morning. Go ahead, please. Back to you."

The predominant reason for the market share capture is net new customers served at Cisco, both at the national and local level. So we're winning more new business than at any other point in time in company history. The why breaks down to 2 pretty fundamentally basic things. First is the compensation model that we changed, as you know, June of last year. We are now compensating our associates to be more prospecting versus cultivating and that is paying dividends. So they drive the behaviors that we expect and we are seeing significant benefit in dividend from rewarding those associates for the good work they're doing in winning new business. 
The second reason is the supply chain health. We have customers almost, on a daily basis, large and small, coming to us and asking for Sysco to take on their business. I won't name the state but we had a very large education customer come to us this week actually and say, ""We're not getting the support we need, and can Cisco take on our business?"" And we're finalizing the details of the contract, which is why I'm not going to quote a where, but we expect that business to come on board by Jan 1. So that is a signal of our strength, the confidence that large and small customers have and our ability to ship on time and full at rates greater than the market. 
John, specifically what competitor segment that's coming from? I think it's kind of all the above. But stronger players with broader access to inventory, clearly performing well. A fact to prove that point, we have more inventory on hand at this moment in time than we did pre COVID. So are there select product shortages? Yes. But we've been able to invest in inventory. We have more inventory on hand than pre COVID, and our staffing levels are where we need them to be. But every time we bring on more people, our demand increases and then we have to go even hire even more people, which is proving that there's continued runway. This was Aaron's point, a moment, ago on our ability to grow our top line as we continue to make progress on our staffing and throughput capacity. John, back to you for any follow-up."

I do not believe that, that growth will come primarily from product margin expansion.

It's just because of the unprecedented environment that we're currently in. Double-digit inflation is unique. And what the tool is helping us in the current period is being very strategic and thoughtful about how to pass through that inflation in a responsible way and being confident that when we make those decisions, that they're executed well. 
We used to do that work manually through a large sales force. We can now do that through a strategic pricing office. And when we make the decision, it's executed immediately. And we can monitor the impact of those decisions and update it on a daily basis, if need be. So the reason for my narrative on inflation is just because of the environment we're in. 
For the longer term, the goal of the pricing project is to be a pricing system, excuse me, is to move to strategic price optimization. I'm not going to name the category because I don't want to telegraph it, but we've got select categories where we are above market from a pricing perspective. We make decent -- very high-quality margins and we're going to run price optimization tests. If we lower slightly our prices in that category, does the sales growth more than offset the margin dilution? And with a pricing software, you can do test versus control, geography-based tests to optimize for the right price. 
And how I've described that work is the following. We will make investments in certain items that are key value items, KVIs, and we will raise prices nominally in the tail of the inventory skew, which is less visible to the customers, which therefore results in flattish margin rates but growing top line as we are -- as my term is right on price at the item customer level, which allows us to win more market share. So that's the longer-term goal of the project. However, the system has been extremely useful during this early part of our fiscal 2022 and how we manage inflation."

Retention is extraordinarily important to our staffing health. And during the first quarter of this fiscal year, we were extremely focused on hiring because, again, the winning of the new business that we've been able to post over the last 2 years requires us to continue to increase our throughput capacity. 
We are spending an extensive amount of time on improving retention. Retention is lower than historical run rate averages to answer your question, but it's getting better as we are putting even more focus on retention. The most important population for us is our driver population. It's a highly skilled job, it's a customer-facing role. And one of the investments that we've made, Aaron and I together, is in a driver retention bonus. We paid it in Q1. We're going to pay it again in Q2. And that retention bonus for our drivers is working. It had a noticeable and visible positive impact on retention. And that's the type of investment that I referred to as a transitory type investment. 
We'll do that investment for as long as it takes. But we do expect, as we improve our overall staffing health that the need for those types of investments will go down. And here's why. Over time, rates are running very high currently at Sysco versus our historical standards. I called that out in my prepared remarks. Over time is actually the thing that drives retention down. If we're spending -- or excuse me, providing our associates too much over time daily. So we're working extremely aggressively to bolster our staffing troops such that we can have over time back to historical standards and that will improve retention. 
It also improves the P&L because over time, rates are pretty punitive to the overall P&L. And I called that out in my prepared remarks, where I said our second half of this fiscal year, we should expect to see improvements in over time, reductions in some of the transitory expenses that I stated, which will help the P&L.

Let me give you some visibility to what's in our bucket of snapback. And it is things like retention programs, hiring bonuses, sign-on bonuses, the incremental recruiting support for the massive hiring we're doing right now, the incremental marketing, third-party contractors we're bringing in to help on a temporary basis relative to staffing. Those things are transitory, onetime, well Q1, Q2, but are not permanent cost structures. 
What's not in there, for instance, is increased overtime costs. That's not onetime, but we also have the opportunity to bring it down over time and are actively working that. So now you have a sense of what's in the bucket. Why do I have confidence that we can address it over time? It's twofold. First is we got started early relative to cost-out efforts. And so to a degree, we put some money in the bank in advance of need, and that effort will continue as we carry forward. 
Second element, as you heard Kevin and I alluded to this earlier, the benefit of all the investment we're doing against our supply chain transformation is incremental productivity, which helps us to manage the overall cost structure as we carry forward. And lastly and finally, if I can add 1, which is just the nature of the categories I called out. They are, by definition, onetime or transitory."

We don't think that double-digit inflation in perpetuity is good for the industry. It's not something we desire. It's not something we accept. And we are working very aggressively to push back on cost increases, find alternative suppliers, find alternative items that can lower the net landed cost for our customers. 
And we do believe that inflation will begin tapering. It's just going to take longer to begin tapering than what we originally expected back at the beginning of the year, which Aaron talked about accurately and clearly during his narrative. But with that said, we are not experiencing pushback from our customers. The primary reason is end consumers aren't slowing down in their consumption of food away from home. In fact, the opposite is true. We continue to see sequential improvement in our overall results tied to volume growth and also obviously, inflation at high levels. 
Just to call out with the specificity what we do with our customers, we have built a proprietary inflation tool calculator where we can take an inbound raw material to us that is significantly elevated from a cost perspective. We can highlight for our customers what items on their menu are directly impacted by that inflationary item to then suggest to them the type of menu price changes that they should make. 
And that's what we mean when we say things like value-added services. And I'm not talking about an obvious thing like meat and poultry. I'm talking about things like fats. Shortenings and oils are highly inflationary right now, and there are many different products on the menu that are impacted by the particular raw ingredient cost increase. So our sales reps have been trained and equipped to be able to work with our end customers to educate them. If this raw material has increased, here's our suggestion to you on what you can do with your menu price. 
And it's for that reason that our customers aren't pushing back to the degree that you might suspect externally because they view us as a partner and that's what we are. We're partnering with them to help them be successful and profitable. And the good news for this industry is that the end consumer has remained robust and strong. Jeff, back to you for any further comments."

I believe that will pivot in the future where the personalization work, the pricing work we're doing, the work we're going to do on the loyalty program that I alluded to earlier, we will pivot to more of the growth coming from increased share of wallet. And mathematically, it's why we are confident that we will go from the 1.2x market growth that we're currently delivering to the 1.5x growth, which will be the growth target we have for the third year of our 3-year strategy that we call the Recipe for Growth.

This morning, I'll discuss Sysco's steadily improving financial results. I'll provide an update on our business transformation. And finally, I'll provide some color on the current state of our business environment. I'll then turn it over to Aaron who will discuss the details of Sysco's first quarter financial results.
Let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported first quarter fiscal 2022 results that were fueled by substantial top line momentum that continues to exceed our expectations. Our top line results sequentially increased each month of the quarter despite the presence of the Delta variant and have continued to improve into October. Our sequential improvement in sales and volume is a clear statement of our supply chain strength and our ability to win meaningful market share in this climate. We are pleased with the top line results, and our flow-through to the bottom line exceeded our expectations for the quarter. This strong start gives us confidence in reaffirming our guidance for the full year.
Key headlines for the quarter include a growing top line that improved sequentially throughout the quarter and continued growth through October, as seen on the right side of Slide 4. Q1 represented another period of strong net new business wins for Sysco at both the national and local level. These customer wins will fuel our success in quarters and years to come. Customers are responding to Sysco's relative supply chain strength, our new purpose platform and our improving capabilities driven by our Recipe for Growth strategy. All told, we delivered sales growth of 8.2% versus 2019.
We outperformed our fiscal 2022 growth goal of 1.2x the market in the first quarter, delivering the strongest growth versus the market in the last 5-plus years. We believe additional growth is still in front of us at Sysco as our volume is yet to fully recover in certain segments, such as hospitality, business and industry, foodservice management and international. As these segments recover, additional momentum will be added to our business.
We are preparing now for select segments to further recover in early 2022 by strategically placing inventory and bolstering our staffing levels. For example, we anticipate that our business and industry segment will see upward momentum in January as select customers plan to reopen their offices at that time. International travel restrictions are beginning to ease, which should benefit our hospitality sector in specific regions of our business.
Our operational expenses for the quarter increased due to higher volumes, elevated overtime rates and in intentional expenditures that were targeted to improve our staffing health. We invested in incremental marketing to advertise open positions. We provided new associates with sign-on bonuses and provided referral and retention bonuses to existing staff. We anticipate that these expenses will continue in our second quarter and that we can make progress in reducing the level of investment in the second half of our fiscal year. Our profit flow-through from the top to the bottom line should improve as a result in the second half.
Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by a high rate of inflation, which increased to approximately 13%. We expect inflation to continue at a similar rate through the second quarter before beginning to taper later in the fiscal year. Given current trends in the industry, we expect the tapering will begin further into the fiscal year than we had initially modeled.
Our international business continues to show strong improvement. We have improved from posting a loss in Q3 of 2021 to breaking even in Q4 to making more than $60 million of adjusted profit in our Q1 of fiscal 2022. It is important to note that our international business is skewed to large contract customers that are still heavily impacted by COVID. For example, we over-indexed in Europe in the business, industry and travel segments that remain constrained versus 2019 levels. As such, the relative sales performance in the international sector still lags that of the U.S. segment. However, it also conveys that we have additional recovery still in front of us internationally.
Our Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our international business segment to improve how we serve local customers over time. And we anticipate a shift in our customer mix to the more profitable local sector as we progress on our 3-year strategic plan.
In summary, we delivered very strong top line results, increased profit per case shipped and experienced elevated operating expenses that increased our cost to serve. The combination of these results delivered a strong adjusted operating income for the quarter of $685 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. Both results exceeded our expectations for the quarter and position Sysco to deliver our full year guidance. Aaron will provide more details on our financials shortly, but we are pleased to be off to a strong start in the new fiscal year.
Topic 2, let's turn to our business transformation, which is highlighted on Slide 5. As important as our strong quarterly financial results, our business transformation remains on track, and I will highlight a few examples of our progress this morning. Our pricing project implementation is now substantially complete. The centralized pricing tool enables Sysco to strategically manage the high levels of inflation we are currently experiencing with disciplined and strategic control. We can determine, at the customer item level, exactly what level of inflation to pass through. We can optimize the pass-through to balance profitability and sales growth. There is no better time than the present to have this powerful capability. Longer term, the pricing tool will enable us to accelerate sales growth profitably as we optimize pricing to increase share of wallet and increase pricing trust with our customers.
Our work on the personalization engine continues to advance. This innovative industry-leading program will enable Sysco to further penetrate lines and cases with existing customers and will improve our sales consultants' ability to win new accounts. We will supplement personalization with increased service levels for top customers through an innovative loyalty program that we will discuss more in future quarterly calls.
Our sales transformation is proving to be very successful as our sales teams continue to win new business at record levels. As I mentioned in my financial narrative, our local and national sales teams delivered strong wins in the quarter that will help fuel our future growth profitably.
Lastly, we are continuing to improve the efficiency of our organization as we further reduce our structural expenses to fund our strategic initiatives. Over the past few quarters, we regionalized the leadership structure of our specialty businesses, FreshPoint and SSMG, and we followed the playbook of our U.S. Broadline regionalization and have now implemented the more agile and efficient model for our 2 main specialty businesses.
As shown on Slide 6, during our first quarter, we successfully closed on the Greco and Sons transaction, which we expect to deliver over $1 billion in incremental sales to Sysco in fiscal 2022, ahead of our deal model expectations. More importantly, we plan to leverage the Greco business model to build a nationwide Italian platform that is the best in the industry, which will further deliver incremental sales beyond the $1 billion just mentioned.
In addition to closing the Greco transaction, we acquired a produce distributor in October that will operate as a part of our FreshPoint business segment and will improve our ability to provide fresh produce and value-added fresh-cut capabilities to the Pennsylvania and Ohio markets. You may not realize that Sysco is the largest specialty produce distributor in the United States vis-à-vis our FreshPoint platform. Our produce business has a high-growth CAGR and attractive margins. Growing in the specialty sector is a priority for Sysco, enabling us to gain more share of wallet from customers by combining our Broadline capabilities with the premium service levels, selling skills and product assortment availability of specialty.
Our Recipe for Growth is still in the very early innings, but we can see the benefits of our developing capabilities and the new customers we are winning and the progress that we are making in market share gains. Importantly, our first quarter results exceeded our 1.2x market share growth target for fiscal 2022. More importantly, as the Recipe for Growth matures, the impact on our top line growth will accelerate. As such, we remain committed to growing profitably 1.5x the market as we exit our fiscal 2024.
Topic 3 for today is an update on the state of the business. During our last earnings call, I highlighted the critical importance of staffing health due to the supply chain challenges that are well documented across all industries. As covered on bullets on Slide 7, we have made progress throughout this quarter in improving our staffing levels. Our leadership team, top to bottom, has been extraordinarily focused on improving our staffing health. A good example of our efforts is the execution of our first-ever nationwide hiring event in the second week of October. We leveraged extensive digital marketing and a streamlined hiring process to net more than 1,000 new supply chain associates to bolster our troops. When coupled with our year-to-date hiring success, we are making solid progress on increasing our throughput capacity.
Additionally, during the quarter, we opened our first Driver Academy, our first academy classes in session, as we say at Sysco, and we are training our next generation of Sysco drivers. We are bullish on expanding this program across the country in the coming year, and we are confident it will make a meaningful difference in generating a solid driver pipeline.
From a product availability perspective, although our fill rates still lag our historical standards, we were able to deliver a higher fill rate to customers than the industry average. We have strong relationships with our key suppliers and a merchant team that is extremely focused on finding and sourcing product substitutions. I have personally engaged with top suppliers to ensure a solid partnership with Sysco, and I am cautiously optimistic that our suppliers' performance will improve through the remainder of the year and into our fiscal 2023. Supplier improvement will be a key to improving customer fill rate and customer satisfaction.
Lastly, you may have seen the recent announcement regarding the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's requirements for employers with 100 or more employees. I am pleased to inform you that Sysco began a weekly COVID testing regimen in September, and as such, we are already compliant with the majority of the OSHA's stated guidelines. The safety of our associates and our customers is our #1 priority, and we remain steadfast in protecting our team.
In summary, Sysco continues to lead the industry in how we are supporting our customers during this challenging supply chain environment. Our Net Promoter Scores are outperforming the Broadline distribution industry, and our ability to serve customers remains best-in-class. We remain the only national distributor without system-wide minimum orders, and we will endeavor to increase the flexibility and service that we provide our customers in the coming quarters and years.
The impact of our relative supply chain success can be seen in our results. We sequentially increased sales throughout the quarter and expanded our market share capture. We now have more than 10 consecutive months of gaining market share, and we are on track to deliver our stated goal for the year, growing 1.2x the industry. And our Recipe for Growth strategy will enable us to accelerate, over the next 3 years, and grow at 1.5x the industry by the end of our fiscal year 2024.
I want to thank all of our associates for their tremendous hard work over the past quarter as Sysco experienced unprecedented growth and supply chain challenges. We are winning in the marketplace, and that would not have been possible without the dedication of our sales, logistics and merchandising teams. I'm honored to serve these associates and work by their side.
I'll now turn it over to Aaron who will provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter before we open it up for questions. Aaron, over to you."

Our strong first quarter fiscal 2022 financial headlines are: growing demand with sales exceeding Q1 fiscal 2019 by 8.2%; a profitable quarter, exceeding our plans with EBITDA comparable to pre-COVID 2019 levels; aggressive investment by Sysco against hiring a snapback, allowing Sysco to lead the industry in otherwise turbulent times; purposeful investments in working capital to continue to lead in product availability; a strong return to profitability by our international business; and great progress against our balanced capital allocation strategy, including continued investments against the 5 pillars of our Recipe for Growth and upgrade to BBB of our investment-grade rating by S&P; the elimination of all debt covenant restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or increase our dividend in the future; and a decision that we are announcing today, namely that we have satisfied our internal criteria to commence share repurchase. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we will begin our repurchase of up to $500 million of shares over the course of this fiscal year.
During today's call, I'm going to cover the income statement and cash flow for the quarter, and then I will close with some observations on our guidance for fiscal 2022. First quarter sales were $16.5 billion, an increase of 39.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and an 8.2% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, were up 46.5% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and up 11.6% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019.
SYGMA was up 11.8% versus fiscal 2021 and up 5.1% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. You will recall that in SYGMA, the increase in sales in the quarter is more modest because of the purposeful transition-out of an unprofitable customer, which we announced in our third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call, and because during the quarter, some consumers are switching from their favorite QSR drive-up back to some of the excellent sit-down restaurants served by our more profitable U.S. Foodservice segment.
Local case volume, within a subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 23.8%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 28.1%.
With respect to our international business, restrictions continue to ease across our international operations in the first quarter. International sales were up 34% versus fiscal 2021 while also improving sequentially over prior quarters to down less than 1% versus fiscal 2019, indicating that we have more upside to come. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1% on Sysco's sales results.
Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 13%. The good news is that we continue to manage our profitability well in the inflationary environment.
Let me call out a couple of numbers, and then we'll discuss inflation further. Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the first quarter, increasing 33.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 2%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and, compared to both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments. That's a real sign of health in our business.
While it is gross profit dollars that count, inflation did impact our gross margin rates for the enterprise during the quarter as it decreased 79 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2021 and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The rate was flat sequentially with Q4 of fiscal 2021. The gross margin decline versus the prior year was driven by accelerating inflation and margin changes at our higher-margin U.S. businesses with the larger USFS businesses growing volume at lower margin rates.
We continue to manage the inflationary pressures with both our suppliers and our customers and, thus far, have not seen much pushback on our ability to pass along pricing. In addition, the fact that we are now substantially complete in our rollout of our Periscope pricing system means that we have more tools than ever before to manage our profitability while being right on price.
Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense came in at $2.3 billion with expense increases from the prior year driven by 3 things: first, the variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes; second, more than $57 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback; and third, more than $24 million of operating expense investments for our Recipe for Growth. Together, the snapback investments and the transformation costs totaled approximately $81 million of operating expense this quarter and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.12.
Even with those significant snapback and transformation operating expense investments, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 13.9%, an almost 200 basis point improvement from fiscal 2021 and a 64 basis [ point ] improvement from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. Doing the simple math, if we removed the transitory snapback investments and the transformation investments I referenced earlier, total OpEx would have been at 13.4% of sales. That is a real sign of the power of our earlier cost-out efforts. To repeat what we said before, during fiscal 2022, our cost-out helps us to cover snapback and transformation costs.
Finally, for the first fiscal quarter, adjusted operating income increased $320 million from last year to $685 million, putting us basically on par with adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019, even with the snapback investments and the transformation investments. This was primarily driven by a 58% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and strong profitability from international.
Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.49 to $0.83 for the first quarter. Perhaps pointing out the obvious, if we extract the $51 million of incremental interest expense we are carrying in Q1 of fiscal 2022, resulting from the COVID-related precautionary bonds we issued in 2020, our adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2022 would have been more in line with our pre-COVID adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2019. If you go a step further and exclude both the interest expense and the $81 million of snapback and transformation costs, you really begin to see why we believe that in the long term, Sysco has significant earnings potential.
Now let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $111 million during the first quarter as we responded to rising sales and purposely invested in inventory in support of managing product availability during the snapback better than the industry. We also purposely invested in longer-lead inventory to support customers such as K-12 schools and health care facilities during the snapback, consistent with Sysco's purpose statement. We also saw manageable changes in receivables levels that we expected to accompany rising sales and arising from the mix of business as Sysco executes its Recipe for Growth.
Our net CapEx spend was $79.4 million and is ramping up as teams submit business cases for investments against the Recipe for Growth. We will manage those investments over the course of our 3-year plan to ensure our growth.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $31 million. At the end of the first quarter, after our investments in the business, payments of the acquisition price for Greco and our dividend payments, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
In May, we committed to supporting a strong investment-grade credit rating with a targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x, which we continue to expect to hit by the end of fiscal 2022. Later this year, we plan to pay off the $450 million of notes due in June of 2022 and may, should the circumstances warrant it, take further action against our debt portfolio. S&P recently acknowledged the progress against our leverage ratio by upgrading us to BBB flat.
We also paid our increased dividend of $0.47 per share in July and again in October. Given that we paid our increased dividend starting in July, consistent with our status as a dividend aristocrat, we expect to next address decisions around our dividend per share sometime during calendar year 2022. As I mentioned earlier, we plan to commence share repurchase activity under the $5 billion share repurchase authority we announced in May at Investor Day beginning in the second quarter. As I stated a moment ago, that will take the form of the repurchase of up to $500 million of shares by the end of the fiscal year.
That concludes my prepared remarks on the fiscal first quarter. Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2022. As Kevin highlighted, we expect to continue to grow at or above 1.2x the market in fiscal 2022. We are operating in a dynamic environment with significant inflation. While we do expect inflation to moderate by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, it may take longer to taper than originally anticipated, though it is hard to predict. We expect to pass through the vast majority of our COGS inflation.
We are assuming continued heavy snapback and transformation investments in Q2 at levels at least equal to the investments in Q1. We are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the year. Fiscal 2022 EPS will be in the range of $3.33 to $3.53, reflecting the $0.10 increase that we called out last quarter. As always, our EPS guidance does not assume changes to the federal tax rate. All in all, we have confidence for the rest of the year.
In summary, we've had a solid quarter, and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We are excited about the future as we continue to advance Sysco's Recipe for Growth.

As I said in the prepared remarks, we've made a lot of progress in the quarter. We are definitely leading the industry from a health of staffing perspective and health of the supply chain, which is what's enabling us to win market share. And what I would say is the situation steadily improved through the quarter.
August, I would submit, is probably our toughest spot of the calendar year from a staffing perspective as our volume was really recovering and our staffing needs were most significant. In September, 23 states opened up. The government supplemental benefits were retired, and we did see an increase in applicant flow. We actually weren't anticipating that because our base pay wages are well above the $15 per hour breakeven component. Our selectors get paid in the mid-$20s. Our drivers get paid in the mid-$30s. We weren't expecting an improvement tied to that, but we did experience an improvement in September tied to the retiring of those benefits.
Most notably or even more importantly, we've gotten a lot better at recruiting, hiring and training of our staff. We're really pleased with the efforts to digitize our marketing efforts tied to our open jobs. We've streamlined the hiring process. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we conducted our first-ever nationwide, at every single site in the country, hiring event and netted over 1,000 people joining our team in just 1 week alone, which was a big progress for us. So we're doing really well from a recruitment perspective.
To answer your question specifically, as I said in my remarks, we have not had to resort to ""meaningful"" base pay change. The vast majority of the expenses that we are putting forth are what we call transitory or 2-way doors. You can go through. You can turn around. You can come back. So what does that mean?  Hiring bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses, advertising. We are spending money in places like Facebook to advertise the awareness and creation of visibility to these jobs.
Aaron called out that those expenditures will continue into Q2. And then we will have the opportunity to begin to taper some of those investments because they're transitory. We've had select locations, a very small number of them, that we did a wage review and needed to make some adjustments, but that was not meaningful or material for Sysco.
Aaron wants to add something, tossing it to him."

So we use external reporting and internal reporting through Net Promoter Score to gauge our fill rate and how it's trending. Ours has been improving over the last quarter.

So our team has worked harder than ever before on ensuring we can improve fill rates.
The answer to your question is, yes, our performance is stronger than the industry. And yes, that gap widened in the quarter. We believe it's one of the components of our market share capture. But it's not the only reason. It's 3 reasons. It's our throughput capacity is higher because of the staffing health. Yes, our fill rate is stronger. The third, though, is our sales teams are just doing an extraordinarily good job of being out in the market, acquiring new customers and winning more share of wallet with existing customers."

And perhaps in the percent of total component that you're seeing is actually fueled not because of deceleration in our local business. We accelerated our performance at the local level.
It's the national sales and in new business, we've just done extraordinarily well with winning new business. And to be crystal clear, this isn't a guns or butter choice. One success at the national level does not hinder our ability over the long term to win at the local level. We are going to win at both national and local level.

I'll start with the headline, which is, as you saw on our chart, October was continuation of acceleration of our total performance. So each month of our Q1 accelerated in October continued that strength, and that's despite the presence of the Delta variant during the quarter. So we're really pleased with top line, strong, compelling, continued growth fueled by a recovering market but even more fueled by our market share capture.
As I said in my prepared remarks, we're growing at more than 1.2x the market, which is the highest rate of growth at Sysco in more than 5 years. The sectors that are still constrained versus '19, that's the language that I would use: travel and hospitality, for sure; foodservice; management; international, as I called out on my prepared remarks; and there's some softness in health care vis-à-vis long-term care tied to COVID, which is the new starts or new bed patients, as they call them, are constrained.
We're not concerned about health care for the long term. With the aging of America, they call this Silver Tsunami, we actually view health care as a growth opportunity for our company for the longer term. We see the opposite of what you just said, Alex. We see our customers contacting us in the travel and industry, in business -- in travel and hospitality, excuse me, in business and industry sectors gearing up for what they believe to be a January step-up in volume. And mostly, that's driven by corporations that have been mostly working from home beginning the process of bringing their employees back to work in January.
We do very well in that space, partnering with foodservice management companies. And we're working right now to preposition inventory to be prepared from a staffing perspective. As far as rolling over tough comp compares for holiday season, that's not something we're concerned about.

And then that kind of gets into the second part of my question, which is that, is it also possible to talk about where some of the segments are kind of running versus 2019? And I ask all this because your case volume is still modestly below '19 in the U.S., which is obviously understandable. But I'm kind of curious as to what all of this is saying about where your case volume can be, let's call it, by the end of this fiscal year or so or early next year when life is obviously hopefully a lot more normal.

My language that I used in the prepared remarks is we're performing better than the industry average, and that is the most accurate descriptor of our performance. We are below our historical fill rate standards. We set a very high bar for ourselves, ship on time and ship in full, and we are below our historical standards. The why is that our inbound fill rate from our suppliers to us is well below our historical standards. Our output to our customers is actually significantly higher than the inbound fill rate to Sysco, and the how and why behind that is the work we do to find substitutes to bridge customers to alternative products. And that's what's creating the relative strength of Sysco versus others is the good work our merchant teams are doing to find product substitutions.
I think your question is more like, is there even more sales to be had if fill rates improve? I would say, yes. How long it will take for a fill rate to improve is subject for debate. So what we're doing, because we want to take ownership of what we can directly control, is to be even better at managing fill rate.
So we're improving our website to provide dynamic visibility to out-of-stocks and provide suggestions at point-of-sale to the customer on things that can be bought alternatively. And our sales teams and merchandising teams, when we find ourselves, as I mentioned earlier, in a situation of long-term outs, are being very proactive, providing quick selling bulletins to our sales teams, digital marketing pushes to our customers, including e-mails on suggesting to them alternatives and the like.
So it's a core strength of our company. I meaningfully desire for the inbound fill rate to Sysco to improve. We're working very closely with our suppliers on that. And we think it will improve but not quickly. It's going to be kind of a sequential steady slow improvement in fill rate into our fiscal 2023.
As it relates to volume, in the second part of your question, what I would say is we expect at the end of our fiscal Q3 to be back to 2019 from a volume perspective. And we have segments that will be at that level in Q2 of this fiscal year. So within our existing fiscal year, we will be back to 2019 volume levels. I'm not going to break it down by segment.

The predominant reason for the market share capture is net new customers served at Sysco, both at the national and local level. So we're winning more new business than at any other point in time in company history. The why breaks down to 2 pretty fundamentally basic things. First is the compensation model that we changed, as you know, June of last year. We are now compensating our associates to be more prospecting versus cultivating, and that is paying dividends. So they drive the behaviors that we expect, and we are seeing significant benefit in dividend from rewarding those associates for the good work they're doing in winning new business.
The second reason is the supply chain health. We have customers almost, on a daily basis, large and small, coming to us and asking for Sysco to take on their business. I won't name the state, but we had a very large education customer come to us this week actually and say, ""We're not getting the support we need, and can Sysco take on our business?"" And we're finalizing the details of the contract, which is why I'm not going to quote the where, but we expect that business to come onboard by Jan 1. So that is a signal of our strength, the confidence that large and small customers have and our ability to ship on time and full at rates greater than the market.
John, specifically what competitor segment that's coming from? I think it's kind of all the above. But stronger players with broader access to inventory, clearly performing well. A fact to prove that point, we have more inventory on hand at this moment in time than we did pre-COVID.
So are there select product shortages? Yes. But we've been able to invest in inventory. We have more inventory on hand than pre-COVID, and our staffing levels are where we need them to be. But every time we bring on more people, our demand increases, and then we have to go even -- hire even more people, which is proving that there's continued runway, this was Aaron's point, a moment, ago on our ability to grow our top line as we continue to make progress on our staffing and throughput capacity.

I do not believe that, that growth will come primarily from product margin expansion. It's going to come from continued disciplined expense optimization by taking structural costs out and investing in capabilities that drive the top line. So why the EBIT margin grows is, a, the top line will be accelerating; b, we'll be taking structural costs out of the business. And those 2 levers in combination is what expands the EBIT margin. But sales growth and cost reductions, not for margin rate growth.

It's just because of the unprecedented environment that we're currently in. Double-digit inflation is unique. And what the tool is helping us in the current period is being very strategic and thoughtful about how to pass through that inflation in a responsible way and being confident that when we make those decisions, that they're executed well.
We used to do that work manually through a large sales force. We can now do that through a strategic pricing office. And when we make the decision, it's executed immediately. And we can monitor the impact of those decisions and update it on a daily basis, if need be. So the reason for my narrative on inflation is just because of the environment we're in.
For the longer term, the goal of the pricing project is to be a pricing system, excuse me, is to move to strategic price optimization. I'm not going to name the category because I don't want to telegraph it, but we've got select categories where we are above market from a pricing perspective. We make decent -- very high-quality margins, and we're going to run price optimization tests. If we lower slightly our prices in that category, does the sales growth more than offset the margin dilution? And with a pricing software, you can do test versus control, geography-based tests, to optimize for the right price. 
And how I've described that work is the following. We will make investments in certain items that are key value items, KVIs, and we will raise prices nominally in the tail of the inventory skew, which is less visible to the customers, which, therefore, results in flattish margin rates but growing top line as we are -- as my term is right on price at the item customer level, which allows us to win more market share. So that's the longer-term goal of the project. However, the system has been extremely useful during this early part of our fiscal 2022 and how we manage inflation."

Retention is extraordinarily important to our staffing health. And during the first quarter of this fiscal year, we were extremely focused on hiring because, again, the winning of the new business that we've been able to post over the last 2 years requires us to continue to increase our throughput capacity. We are spending an extensive amount of time on improving retention.
Retention is lower than historical run rate averages, to answer your question, but it's getting better as we are putting even more focus on retention. The most important population for us is our driver population. It's a highly skilled job. It's a customer-facing role. And one of the investments that we've made, Aaron and I together, is in a driver retention bonus. We paid it in Q1. We're going to pay it again in Q2. And that retention bonus for our drivers is working. It had a noticeable and visible positive impact on retention. And that's the type of investment that I referred to as a transitory-type investment.
We'll do that investment for as long as it takes. But we do expect, as we improve our overall staffing health, that the need for those types of investments will go down. And here's why. Overtime rates are running very high currently at Sysco versus our historical standards. I called that out in my prepared remarks. Overtime is actually the thing that drives retention down, if we're spending -- or excuse me, providing our associates too much overtime daily. So we're working extremely aggressively to bolster our staffing troops such that we can have overtime back to historical standards and that we'll improve retention. 
It also improves the P&L because overtime rates are pretty punitive to the overall P&L. And I called that out in my prepared remarks where I said our second half of this fiscal year, we should expect to see improvements in overtime, reductions in some of the transitory expenses that I stated, which will help the P&L.
Aaron, to you for any further comments."

Once we've invested against the business for the business cases that are in front of us, we are also very focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet.

We have continued opportunities to improve that, of course, given the interest levels we're carrying versus prior years, but we're feeling good about our capital allocation against our debt portfolio so far.

What's not in there, for instance, is increased overtime costs. That's not onetime, but we also have the opportunity to bring it down over time and are actively working on that. So now you have a sense of what's in the bucket.
Why do I have confidence that we can address it over time? It's twofold. First is we got started early relative to cost-out efforts. And so to a degree, we put some money in the bank in advance of need, and that effort will continue as we carry forward. Second element is, you heard Kevin and I alluded to this earlier, the benefit of all the investment we're doing against our supply chain transformation is incremental productivity, which helps us to manage the overall cost structure as we carry forward.

And we do believe that inflation will begin tapering. It's just going to take longer to begin tapering than what we originally expected back at the beginning of the year, which Aaron talked about accurately and clearly during his narrative.
But with that said, we are not experiencing pushback from our customers. The primary reason is end consumers aren't slowing down in their consumption of food away from home. In fact. In fact, the opposite is true. We continue to see sequential improvement in our overall results tied to volume growth and also, obviously, inflation at high levels.
Just to call out with the specificity what we do with our customers, we have built a proprietary inflation tool calculator where we can take an inbound raw material to us that is significantly elevated from a cost perspective. And we can highlight for our customers what items on their menu are directly impacted by that inflationary item to then suggest to them the type of menu price changes that they should make. And that's what we mean when we say things like value-added services. And I'm not talking about an obvious thing like meat and poultry. I'm talking about things like fats. Shortenings and oils are highly inflationary right now, and there are many different products on the menu that are impacted by the particular raw ingredient cost increase. So our sales reps have been trained and equipped to be able to work with our end customers to educate them. If this raw material has increased, here's our suggestion to you on what you can do with your menu price.
And it's for that reason that our customers aren't pushing back to the degree that you might suspect externally because they view us as a partner, and that's what we are. We're partnering with them to help them be successful and profitable. And the good news for this industry is that the end consumer has remained robust and strong.

John asked the question earlier, like which are the primary drivers of the growth. Share of wallet has been steadily improving, but it has not been the primary source of the growth.

Share of wallet has been steadily improving, but it has not been the primary source of the growth. The primary source of the growth has been net new customer wins, Kelly, over the last, let's call it, 2 years. I believe that will pivot in the future where the personalization work, the pricing work we're doing, the work we're going to do on the loyalty program that I alluded to earlier, we will pivot to more of the growth coming from increased share of wallet.
And mathematically, it's why we are confident that we will go from the 1.2x market growth that we're currently delivering to the 1.5x growth, which will be the growth target we have for the third year of our 3-year strategy that we call the Recipe for Growth. So the percent contribution of the growth will pivot more towards share of wallet in the coming fiscal years."
