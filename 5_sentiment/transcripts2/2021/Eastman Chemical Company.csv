Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments. We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-",1024,"Good morning. And thanks, Greg. Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments. 
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020. 
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion. While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. 
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control. In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share. 
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020. 
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21. Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21. 
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio. We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion. 
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plans to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic, that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders. 
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning. 
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010. We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming an incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets. A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve their recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there. From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business. And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive. So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonate technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have. And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology. And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do run recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to make at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. 
But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question. So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets. So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets we used here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources. The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets, are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products. So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. [indiscernible] is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see a number of other customers making similar announcements."

So a lot of different applications in CRT going on at the same level. That's part of that $500 million to $1 billion platform combined with the PRT. So a lot going on."

And so I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20.

Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back. But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth. And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth. We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display, creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation. It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps. There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings. I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue, we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year. We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that. And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning, processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021, even in an economic environment that has momentum. On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment. And our long-term focus is to continue to grow that and not just be at greater than $1 billion. But one, I'd also like to recognize how the Eastman team stepped up in 2020 to deliver that $1.1 billion of free cash flow. It took everyone and it took focus, and the team delivered."

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins. And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right? So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better and these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs. I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part.

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology methanolysis is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there. And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period. So molecular cycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material to plastic that they cannot use. It ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel. So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly. We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe. As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out.

When you look at -- for the last decade, we've been launching a wide range of products that are sustainable and much better for the environment across our portfolio. And now you add on the circular economy and what we can do and how we could scale this up through partnerships. I think we can really pivot the nature of who we are and the significant improvements we can make in our carbon footprint and drive towards that 30% reduction in 2030 is a huge change in our footprint, not to mention where we want to all get by 2050. So I think we are really repositioning the company in a pretty significant way. But the whole value of what we can do that's so unique and so powerful in the circular economy is leveraging our integration of our site here in Tennessee. We've talked a lot about scale and integration being a huge competitive advantage for us. And a lot of people have thought about that being cost. I've always thought about that being about enabling innovation and growth. And here's another example where this vastly interconnected and complicated infrastructure that we have here is going to be key to differentiating us and doing something that very few other people can do at our economic efficiency. I mean we can definitely do methanolysis around the world, but the way we can do it here is going to be uniquely advantaged relative to a stand-alone plant. Both are attractive. This is just really attractive, and the other ones are still going to be more attractive than the 15% ROIC.

If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plants, that would be additive to those numbers. And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive and it's limited capacity. But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have a semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low-CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So we just need to catch up now."

And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the 2/3 will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So we got a lot of great businesses doing well there. And that comment, by the way, both on earnings and strong growth goes back to '18.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-1",1024,"Good morning, and thanks, Greg. Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010.
We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets.
A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve the recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there.
From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business.
And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive.
So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonyl technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have.
And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology.
And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question.
So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets.
So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets what we use here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources.
The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products.
So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. Patagonia is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see some number of other customers making similar announcements."

So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs a",740,"Sure. So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back.
But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth.
And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth.
We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation.
It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps.
There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings.
I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year.
We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that.
And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021. Even in an economic environment, that has momentum.
On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment. And our long-term focus is to continue to grow that and not just be at greater than $1 billion. But one, I'd also like to recognize how the Eastman team stepped up in 2020 to deliver that $1.1 billion of free cash flow. It took everyone and it took focus, and the team delivered."

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins.
And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right?
So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it anyhow that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs, and I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

In other words, if I'm unzipping it, as you say, into ethylene glycol and DMT, is it the case that the output is entirely fungible and the variability is a nonissue?

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Koda",463,"Sure. So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.
And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period.
So molecular recycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material, the plastic, that they cannot use, it ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.
So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly.
We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe.
As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out. You have to remember that in '18, we added a significant chunk of capacity in Tritan that we're certainly making progress in filling out, but we still have a few years before we have to add more capacity."

So automotive, which I'll roll tires into as well, I mean, demand came back strongly across the automotive space, whether it's our interlayers, performance films logging in significant record earnings in the fourth quarter or tires demand actually coming back quite strongly in the third and fourth quarter. So demand's come back across the board in that sector as you can see from a lot of external reports.
We're advantaged that a lot of our products go into the luxury market, especially in Advanced Materials. So we benefited from that market, frankly, holding up a bit better last year than the overall market did and how that's continuing to accelerate for us. And then you've got accelerated growth with acoustics and heads-up display doing really well.
Our new next-gen paint protection film and performance films doing incredibly well, a service channel strategy that allowed us to grow a lot of market share in China this year -- or I should say, in '20. I mean that's going to continue to provide growth. So it is a real combination of market and innovation and service model that's driving a lot of that growth. And you know that the margins of these businesses are above segment average and above company average. So you get a lot of mix lift when these things sort of come back.
We've been saying that the volume and mix hit that we took in '19 relative to '18 and '20 versus '19 has a mirror image when it starts coming back, and you start to see that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to see it now. I will note, though, that demand is exceptionally strong across the auto supply chain. And so we are running into logistics constraints and capacity limits and serving all of it. So we're still happy to serve as much as we are, but it's a bit challenging out there on the logistics front right now for a lot of products."

So those are interconnected. So the type of waste plastic we're talking about getting to, if you think about the first methanolysis plant and what we think we're going to do with the CRT, that is what drives us towards that platform revenue value of the $500 million to $1 billion. If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plants, that would be additive to those numbers.
And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive, and it's limited capacity.
But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that, we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So we just need to catch up now."

But what we -- we've seen -- you've seen tremendous growth and progress and success in the Advanced Materials division, and that's all the specialty products delivering that growth when you look at that volume and mix improvement. When you look at AFP, it's really important to sort of separate out the 2/3 versus the 1/3.
Obviously, the 2/3 is a lot more stable, margins well above the segment average. And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the 2/3 will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So we got a lot of great businesses doing well there.
And that comment, by the way, both on earnings and strong growth goes back to '18.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-1",1024,"Good morning, and thanks, Greg. Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010.
We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets.
A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve the recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there.
From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business.
And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive.
So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonyl technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have.
And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology.
And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question.
So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets.
So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets what we use here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources.
The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products.
So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. Patagonia is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see some number of other customers making similar announcements."

So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20.

Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back.
But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth.
And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth.
We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation.
It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps.
There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings.
I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year.
We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that.
And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021. Even in an economic environment, that has momentum.
On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment.

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins.
And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right?
So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it anyhow that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs, and I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.
And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period.
So molecular recycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material, the plastic, that they cannot use, it ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.
So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly.
We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe.
As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out. You have to remember that in '18, we added a significant chunk of capacity in Tritan that we're certainly making progress in filling out, but we still have a few years before we have to add more capacity."

So automotive, which I'll roll tires into as well, I mean, demand came back strongly across the automotive space, whether it's our interlayers, performance films logging in significant record earnings in the fourth quarter or tires demand actually coming back quite strongly in the third and fourth quarter. So demand's come back across the board in that sector as you can see from a lot of external reports.
We're advantaged that a lot of our products go into the luxury market, especially in Advanced Materials. So we benefited from that market, frankly, holding up a bit better last year than the overall market did and how that's continuing to accelerate for us. And then you've got accelerated growth with acoustics and heads-up display doing really well.
Our new next-gen paint protection film and performance films doing incredibly well, a service channel strategy that allowed us to grow a lot of market share in China this year -- or I should say, in '20. I mean that's going to continue to provide growth. So it is a real combination of market and innovation and service model that's driving a lot of that growth. And you know that the margins of these businesses are above segment average and above company average. So you get a lot of mix lift when these things sort of come back.
We've been saying that the volume and mix hit that we took in '19 relative to '18 and '20 versus '19 has a mirror image when it starts coming back, and you start to see that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to see it now. I will note, though, that demand is exceptionally strong across the auto supply chain. And so we are running into logistics constraints and capacity limits and serving all of it. So we're still happy to serve as much as we are, but it's a bit challenging out there on the logistics front right now for a lot of products."

And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive, and it's limited capacity.
But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that, we just continue to scale up.

So the stability of that segment and the margins are actually quite good, offset, of course, by what we've identified in the tires and adhesives where we're taking some actions. But overall, the portfolio is -- on the volume side is actually holding up quite well."

And we're seeing the payoff of that in the stability we delivered last year and the strong free cash flow and actually quite good earnings, especially if you back out the $100 million of additional inventory actions and feel great about how we're positioned for this year.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010.
We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets.
A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve the recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there.
From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business.
And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive.
So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonyl technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have.
And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology.
And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

The key factor, as we think about 2021 and going forward, is, overall, that will give us an opportunity to, I'll call it, continue to debottleneck our facilities in Texas, where we have a much better cost position. And from a fixed cost structure standpoint, we expect to improve earnings by about $25 million on a go-forward basis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question.
So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets.
So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets what we use here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources.
The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products.
So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. Patagonia is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see some number of other customers making similar announcements."

That goes into our textiles, our Naia fabrics that we're growing quite strongly as well as into some thermoplastics in the specialty plastics business and a new growth opportunity we see in AFP around fumed insulation that would be cellulosic based and very sustainable offering versus EPA.

So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20.

Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back.
But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth.
And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth.
We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation.
It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps.
There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings.
I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year.
We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that.
And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021. Even in an economic environment, that has momentum.
On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment. And our long-term focus is to continue to grow that and not just be at greater than $1 billion. But one, I'd also like to recognize how the Eastman team stepped up in 2020 to deliver that $1.1 billion of free cash flow. It took everyone and it took focus, and the team delivered."

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins.
And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right?
So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it anyhow that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs, and I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Koda",463,"Sure. So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.
And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period.
So molecular recycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material, the plastic, that they cannot use, it ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.
So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly.
We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe.
As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out.

We're advantaged that a lot of our products go into the luxury market, especially in Advanced Materials. So we benefited from that market, frankly, holding up a bit better last year than the overall market did and how that's continuing to accelerate for us. And then you've got accelerated growth with acoustics and heads-up display doing really well.
Our new next-gen paint protection film and performance films doing incredibly well, a service channel strategy that allowed us to grow a lot of market share in China this year -- or I should say, in '20. I mean that's going to continue to provide growth. So it is a real combination of market and innovation and service model that's driving a lot of that growth. And you know that the margins of these businesses are above segment average and above company average. So you get a lot of mix lift when these things sort of come back.
We've been saying that the volume and mix hit that we took in '19 relative to '18 and '20 versus '19 has a mirror image when it starts coming back, and you start to see that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to see it now. I will note, though, that demand is exceptionally strong across the auto supply chain. And so we are running into logistics constraints and capacity limits and serving all of it. So we're still happy to serve as much as we are, but it's a bit challenging out there on the logistics front right now for a lot of products."

And you can expect us to continue to look at the footprint of tire additives, adhesives and also the contract structures within those businesses.
And considering the types of actions that make sense, it could also include joint ventures and divestitures that we've highlighted in addition to just transforming within the Eastman portfolio. We continue to work on reducing the cost without sacrificing also some of the innovation. We continue to make progress in the transition to, I'll call it, the Crystex Cure Pro next generation.

And now you add on the circular economy and what we can do and how we could scale this up through partnerships, I think we can really pivot the nature of who we are and the significant improvements we can make in our carbon footprint and drive towards that 30% reduction in 2030 is a huge change in our footprint, not to mention where we want to all get by 2050. So I think we are really repositioning the company in a pretty significant way.
But the whole value of what we can do that's so unique and so powerful in the circular economy is leveraging our integration of our site here in Tennessee. We've talked a lot about scale and integration being a huge competitive advantage for us. And a lot of people have thought about that being cost. I've always thought about that being about enabling innovation and growth. And here's another example where this vastly interconnected and complicated infrastructure that we have here is going to be key to differentiating us in doing something that very few other people can do at our economic efficiency.
I mean we can definitely do methanolysis around the world, but the way we can do it here is going to be uniquely advantaged relative to a stand-alone plant. Both are attractive.

If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plants, that would be additive to those numbers.
And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive, and it's limited capacity.
But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that, we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So we just need to catch up now."

Obviously, the 2/3 is a lot more stable, margins well above the segment average. And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the 2/3 will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So we got a lot of great businesses doing well there.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010.
We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets.
A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve the recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there.
From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business.
And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive.
So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonyl technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have.
And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology.
And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question.
So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets.
So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets what we use here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources.
The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products.
So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. Patagonia is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see some number of other customers making similar announcements."

So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs a",740,"Sure. So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back.
But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth.
And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth.
We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation.
It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps.
There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings.
I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year.
We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that.
And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021. Even in an economic environment, that has momentum.
On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment. And our long-term focus is to continue to grow that and not just be at greater than $1 billion. But one, I'd also like to recognize how the Eastman team stepped up in 2020 to deliver that $1.1 billion of free cash flow. It took everyone and it took focus, and the team delivered."

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins.
And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right?
So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it anyhow that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs, and I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Koda",463,"Sure. So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.
And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period.
So molecular recycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material, the plastic, that they cannot use, it ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.
So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly.
We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe.
As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out.

We're advantaged that a lot of our products go into the luxury market, especially in Advanced Materials.

When you look at -- for the last decade, we've been launching a wide range of products that are sustainable and much better for the environment across our portfolio.
And now you add on the circular economy and what we can do and how we could scale this up through partnerships, I think we can really pivot the nature of who we are and the significant improvements we can make in our carbon footprint and drive towards that 30% reduction in 2030 is a huge change in our footprint, not to mention where we want to all get by 2050. So I think we are really repositioning the company in a pretty significant way.
But the whole value of what we can do that's so unique and so powerful in the circular economy is leveraging our integration of our site here in Tennessee. We've talked a lot about scale and integration being a huge competitive advantage for us. And a lot of people have thought about that being cost. I've always thought about that being about enabling innovation and growth. And here's another example where this vastly interconnected and complicated infrastructure that we have here is going to be key to differentiating us in doing something that very few other people can do at our economic efficiency.
I mean we can definitely do methanolysis around the world, but the way we can do it here is going to be uniquely advantaged relative to a stand-alone plant. Both are attractive. This is just really attractive, and the other ones are still going to be more attractive than the 15% ROIC.

If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plants, that would be additive to those numbers.
And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive, and it's limited capacity.
But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that, we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So we just need to catch up now."

Obviously, the 2/3 is a lot more stable, margins well above the segment average. And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the 2/3 will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So we got a lot of great businesses doing well there.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-1",1024,"Good morning, and thanks, Greg. Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
We've had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter and robust performance for the full year despite the challenges associated with COVID-19. I'm incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to help us deliver in 2020.
And here are some of the highlights. Early in the year, we took quick and decisive action to adjust our operations to keep employees safe and preserve our operational integrity. We shifted our financial forecast of prioritizing cash and liquidity, given the uncertainties, and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
While we prioritized cash, our earnings performance was resilient, which is a testament to the tremendous investments we've made in our innovation portfolio and our overall business portfolio over the last decade, including enhancing our market development and commercial capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrated we have diverse portfolio of businesses and end markets, which gives us stability. 
As you know, we are committed to being a leader in the circular economy. We've accelerated progress, and it's paying off with several wins across our portfolio, including Eastman being named as a Wall Street Journal Most Sustainably Managed Company of 2020. In addition, in our 2020 sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 1/3 by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Looking forward to 2021, we entered this year with momentum from our record fourth quarter results, and we're seeing clear signs of recovery across many of our markets, including strong orders in January. That said, visibility remains limited due to the continuing effects of COVID-19. This means that we will continue to focus on what we can control.
In 2020, we meaningfully reduced capacity utilization as we aggressively managed inventory well beyond the decline in demand to maximize cash. As a result, EBIT declined by about $100 million just related to this additional inventory actions we took. If volume is flat in '21 compared with '20, we would have about $100 million tailwind from this improved utilization as we go into this year or about $0.60 a share.
Looking at our cost structure, you'll recall that we reduced cost by approximately $150 million in 2020 versus '19, and we estimate about $100 million of this was temporary. We also took actions to accelerate our transformation program, and we are on track to reduce costs in 2021 to offset the return of those temporary costs. As a result, in 2021, we expect our cost structure to be about flat with compared -- when we compare it to 2020.
On top line growth, we expect growth from 3 levers. First, we anticipate market to continue to improve relative to 2020 as we have seen in Q4 and in January. Second, we continue to make progress with our innovation-driven growth model to grow faster than our underlying markets in many of our specialty products. There are a number of examples of this across our portfolio in 2020, and we expect it to continue in '21.
Third, we project a strong improvement in mix with recovery in these high-value markets and the innovation-driven growth of our premium products. A significant portion of our headwinds in 2019 with the trade war as well as 2020 with COVID-19 were related to mix. As growth in our specialty products accelerates in '21, improved mix will be a powerful driver of our earnings growth. We've already seen this benefit in Q4 of '20 and expect it to accelerate through '21.
There are also headwinds, including the lack of visibility related to COVID-19 and other global macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, we're seeing costs for raw materials, energy and logistics rising and have competitive pressures in a few products. When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted EPS will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020. This means our expected '21 EPS will be well above 2019, which would further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio.
We anticipate a strong start to 2021 with adjusted EPS similar to the first quarter of '20. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2020, our EPS was up 15% year-over-year, a very strong performance for our industry at that time. Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
A moment ago, I talked about our intention to be a leader in the circular economy. And as part of that commitment, today, we're announcing, along with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, our plan to build one of the world's largest methanolysis facilities here in Kingsport. Through methanolysis, this world-scale facility will convert waste plastic, polyester plastic that often ends up in landfill and waterways into durable products. Over the next 2 years, Eastman will invest approximately $250 million in the facility, which will support Eastman's commitment to addressing the global waste crisis and mitigating challenges created by climate change, while also creating value for shareholders.
Using the company's polyester renewal technologies, this new facility will use 110 KMT of plastic waste to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycle content. This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%. This is incredibly exciting news, and we're only just beginning.
I'll close where I began with appreciation for the men and women of Eastman that make all of this happen and do it with a bias for action, adaptability and optimism for the future. I share their optimism. This is an exciting time for Eastman. Our strengths have never been clearer, and it gives me the confidence that we are well positioned to manage in this uncertain environment and deliver long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

And it's methanolysis. So it's a technology that's been around for a long time. Kodak developed it decades ago to recycle actually polyester x-ray material, and then they learned and saw the opportunity to take municipal waste and broaden the operating capability of this technology back then. And it's something that I actually wanted to start in 2010.
We actually had the plans on the -- and developing the engineering of it at that time, but the market wasn't ready for it. We're really excited because the market is very much ready for it now. Climate, circularity, sustainability is obviously becoming incredible priority around the world. Even with COVID, it's just become stronger not less. And so we think we're in a great position to be a leader here. When you think about the technology and the opportunity that it has from a market point of view, it's tremendous around a wide range of specialty plastic businesses from hydration to consumer durables, to electronics, ophthalmics, et cetera, to a wide range of markets.
A lot of customers are very interested in this as they are making aggressive commitments to improve the recycled content. And so there's just a lot of engagement. We have over 100 customer trials going on right now across a wide range of different applications. So the ability to grow is there. We've already seen great success in launch with CamelBak and Nalgene, where they've put in our recycled content into our Tritan Renew, and you'll see a lot more announcements as we go through this quarter. So the demand is there.
From a value point of view, as we showed you on the chart, retail products are commanding a premium for recycled content and sustainability. PET, food-grade PET is trading at a substantially higher premium in Europe as people are trying to work towards their recycled content goals. And I think customers recognize that there has to be some amount of premium that we have to achieve to make these kind of investments to solve such a serious challenge we face around the world. Obviously, everyone wants to keep this as affordable as possible. And so we don't expect our premiums to be significant, but sufficient to give us an attractive return. But our primary goal of getting return is on the growth in this business.
And we're able to load this plant really fast is another advantage on the economic side because we can take a balance of slowly growing the specialty conversions like we do in any specialty product, but fill in the rest of capacity with PET into the packaging market where there's strong demand and then just keep on valuing that up over time. So the economics here are quite attractive.
So a lot of different ways to sort of win in both existing applications through premiums and accelerated growth, getting into new applications like electronics and automotive as some key examples. And our scale and integration gives us a huge advantage in how we can do this. We've got some significant advantages in how we can manage our feedstocks."

You asked about the scalability of this and additional plants, sorry, Vincent. So to be clear, the $600 million of new business from innovation is for the total corporation of all of our products, not just methanolysis. When you think about methanolysis and we look at it as a stand-alone opportunity, both the polyester revenue -- the polyester renewal technology and the carbonyl technology combined, we think, is between $500 million and $1 billion revenue platform for the company. Obviously, that doesn't happen in 1 year. It takes years to build that out. But a very substantial platform, frankly, the biggest platform after Tritan before this, and this would be the 2 biggest platforms we have.
And that doesn't include scalability. So that's building plants to serve the demand that we think we can make with our specialty products. We also think this is scalable in partnerships with other people around the world who are very interested in recycled content for their needs and are pursuing a business model around how we scale this into multiple plants around the world focused on doing the methanolysis. It's very scalable to build these plants and economic, and there's an advantage to having them in different regions. So we think there's whole another vector of growth on top of this. But it's early days, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that."

So I don't know where they came up with the name of the technology. But what you basically do is you take polyester waste and you use methanol and a modest amount of energy to convert that waste or unzip the polyester basically back into its intermediates of DMT and EG and other monomers and purify it. So it's actually an input not an output to the process to depolymerize the molecule. So that's sort of how it works. And it's far more energy-efficient than the fossil fuel process. So while it takes a bit of energy in methanol, it's a lot less than sort of pulling oil out of the ground and all the steps to get it to being DMT and EG. So we're 20% to 30% better carbon footprint by doing this technology.
And I think that's an important thing we want to emphasize is, any technologies we do around recycling, we believe there are 2 fundamental goals you have to meet at the same time. We have a plastic waste crisis. We need to address it, and we shouldn't be wasting any of that carbon in the environment or letting it impact the environment. But at the same time, we got to make sure our carbon footprint is better. Otherwise, we're really not improving the overall environment. So every technology we're looking at has a better carbon footprint than the fossil fuel process. That's true of methanolysis. Our CRT also 20% to 50% better depending on the feedstock. So we're addressing both our climate impact with process innovation as well as solving a waste crisis."

When you think about the plastic waste crisis that I think everyone can agree needs to be addressed and there's so much of it out there. And yet, one of the biggest challenges for any of these investments is actually getting it delivered to your site, which is very confusing, but a true challenge and a question.
So we have a lot of partnerships we've developed to supply us with waste. And we have some very unique advantages around how we can handle waste. Because the combination of the PRT using polyester and the CRT being able to use mixed plastic of a wide spectrum as we sort of repurpose our gas fire to reform plastic at the same site, we can actually take a very mixed plastic stream that no one else really can manage because we can take this very low cost and more readily available mix plastic that doesn't require much separation and do that separation very efficiently here in a unique process we've developed and feed that then separated streaming in these 2 assets.
So it allows us to access waste more readily and at a much lower cost because it's lower value when it hasn't been separated. So that's one of the big pluses of the scale and integration that we benefit from here. Not to mention, our CapEx will be probably 10% less with some of the assets what we use here. And so I think that's important and a real advantage. It still takes a lot of work, and we've been devoting the last 18 months in securing a wide range of sources.
The other long-term interesting opportunity that's going to come out of this, a lot of our customers, the big brands, both in textiles on the CRT as well as polyester on a variety of end markets are very interested in a take back program, right? So they want to truly have a circular loop where we go material to material. If they take back used products for them -- from their customers and can send it to us and then we can recycle it back into materials for their products.
So it's a true absolute closed loop. And so it will take a while for that to obviously develop, but I think for a number of brands, it's incredibly important. Patagonia is a great example, where they've been doing this for a while and fully endorsing molecular recycling as the only way they can actually close the loop. And you'll see some number of other customers making similar announcements."

So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs a",740,"Sure. So I'd start with, as we said, what is it that we can control. Our fixed costs, as we said, are going to be neutral in '21 relative to '20. So we took $150 million out that were sort of temporary cost actions through last year. Many of those costs are coming back, especially on the operations. We're running our plants incredibly hard as we're trying to serve the demand that we've seen in the fourth quarter, and it's increasing in January. So that -- those costs are obviously coming back.
But there's still a lot of other costs of efficiency and structural costs or travel with COVID that is not going to come back, certainly not in the first quarter, but we would expect to start coming back through the year. So cost relatively flat on the fixed basis. As Willie just mentioned in a prior answer, you've got this $100 million utilization tailwind just at 2020 volumes without volumes being greater than last year. I mean that's about -- so put all that together, that's $0.60 a share in just the sort of cost utilization side of things before you get the volume growth.
And then we've got volume growth in 3 categories. The first just being market recovery as we're seeing in the fourth quarter and January. And so that is -- we're presuming is going to continue through the rest of this year that the economy continues to recover and that COVID's not going to have some big negative impact. The second is innovation, creating our own growth, right? So a lot of growth that we had last year wasn't just what markets did, but how we created our own growth.
We had phenomenal success in performance films in a very down auto market for the year, yet their revenue was basically flat for the year, where they had strong growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And so that's a great example of innovation creating growth. Great success in acoustics and heads-up display creating growth in interlayers, Tritan delivering a lot of growth where specialty plastics actually grew earnings in total for 2020 over 2019. So a lot of things going well on the innovation side and a lot of traction developing in AFP like [indiscernible]. So a lot of innovation.
It's important to remember that both of the markets that are coming back are high-value mix, like automotive and as well as the innovation having much higher margins than segment average. So there's a huge mix upgrade impact that isn't just about '19 to '20, but it goes all the way back to '18 when you think about -- first, we had a trade war that really hit some high-value markets for us and impacted earnings. Then we piled on a pandemic, and we see us recovering back to '19 volumes and mix and hopefully better than that. So that all helps.
There are some headwinds. Obviously, aviation is not recovering as well this year. And so that's still going to be probably a $30 million headwind in earnings relative to '19. And then we expect raw materials to go up, and there's some lag always in the specialties in catching up to raws. And we have the competitive pressure we've called out in tires and adhesives and acetyls. So a variety of different things going on there. But when you net it all out, it's a very attractive recovery in earnings.
I do want to emphasize though that 20%, 30% range is a genuine range. There is a lot of uncertainty. So while it's great to have growth in January, great to have the recovery in the fourth quarter, it's January. We've learned this lesson in '19 and '20 about what can happen through a year. And while we remain optimistic that these trends will continue we really don't know the impact of COVID and how it's going to impact the economies yet this year.
We certainly are seeing operational limitations about how demand is recovering, especially in logistics and getting products to our customers. So that's limiting us a bit here, certainly in the first quarter. And so there's just those things and factors you have to keep in mind when you think about this range. And I think it's reasonable to be a bit cautious as you start the year in this range, and we build the success through the year."

And actually, it doesn't include a big build on the working capital front. As I think through this, let me start at a high level, which is we expect cash earnings that's consistent with the 20% to 30% that Mark just walked you through. And also as business activity does pick up on the inventory front, we believe that we can offset that.
And what I would highlight is, as part of our transformational efforts, we're investing in advanced integrated business planning processes to enable us to keep the DQO on the inventory side intact and maintain the gains that we've been able to accomplish. And also, we continue to have our programs in AR and accounts payable to offset and continue to make progress on that front. So our base assumption is that working capital will be neutral in 2021. Even in an economic environment, that has momentum.
On the capital front, we do expect in 2021 that CapEx will be $500 million to $525 million. So at least $100 million to $125 million greater than prior year. And obviously, we expect to more than offset that with the cash earnings. So all in all, we've, I think, developed a track record that demonstrates that we can maintain cash flows greater than $1 billion in basically about any environment. And our long-term focus is to continue to grow that and not just be at greater than $1 billion. But one, I'd also like to recognize how the Eastman team stepped up in 2020 to deliver that $1.1 billion of free cash flow. It took everyone and it took focus, and the team delivered."

So as you look at this, you've got a variety of markets that are sort of still recovering relative to '20 that are going to have volumes up in a meaningful way like transportation or autos to be specific, not aviation. Even though aviation will be better this year, but not by much. So you've got markets like that, that are recovering. Textiles, we expect a very strong recovery. And so those will continue to drive value. And those are all very high value relative to corporate average when it comes to variable margins.
And then you've got other markets that are not going to grow as fast because they were really strong last year, like packaging and some hygiene applications and care chemicals. We still see them probably growing as opposed going backward, but not by much, given the strength they had last year. So you can't sort of trade all markets the same way, obviously, as we look at all these different parts of our portfolio. But what's nice is the stability you get from this, right?
So these resilient markets that we were in provided a great stabilizer to the headwinds we saw in automotive last year, where our volume mix, as you noted, was only down 5%, which was quite good for our industry and quite stable because of all these different resilient end markets. And now this year, you're going to sort of have the reverse of that of some of these high-value markets that were impacted last year are going to do much better. And these resilient markets are not going to be a big driver of growth. So it's hard to give you a specific number because a lot of it anyhow that's driving the earnings is mix versus kgs, and I don't want to get into the breakdown of that."

In other words, if I'm unzipping it, as you say, into ethylene glycol and DMT, is it the case that the output is entirely fungible and the variability is a nonissue?

So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Koda",463,"Sure. So let me sort of break this down into the operations part and then, as you just said, the customer qualification part. So the technology, methanolysis, is a pretty robust technology, and methanolysis as a process is not exactly novel. But when Kodak developed this process a long time ago, as I mentioned, when they switched from using a very consistent stream of polyester x-ray films to municipal waste, they discovered that it is challenging to manage a diverse waste stream that also can vary day-to-day based on the mix of plastic you're getting in there.
And what's great about this technology is it does not compete with mechanical recycling, right? So mechanical recycling, where you can do it, is a better answer. It has a very low carbon footprint, but it's restricted to only using very clean feedstock. And most of what they do very clean and clear feedstock from bottles is really what they can handle. And even then they have problems with limitations to some degree on performance and the polymer degrades over time. So there's a limitation to how long you can mechanically recycle plastic, period.
So molecular recycling like methanolysis is essential as a complement to mechanical with the feed -- with the raw material, the plastic, that they cannot use, it ends up in landfill and giving infinite life to plastic because we can constantly recycle this plastic with no degradation. So the key, though, is you have to have a lot of operating experience on how to manage this process. And it's not the methanolysis stuff that's hard. It's the purification stuff that you just got at, Kevin, that requires a lot of capability experience and a lot of trade secrets that we've developed over the years on how to do this to make sure that the intermediates that come out of the plant are purified and basically identical to the ones based on fossil fuel.
So when we get to making the polymer, the polymer is exactly the same. There is no profile or impurities that is an issue. And that's what's so great about customer qualification is that they don't have to -- they have to wrap their head around that it's the same, and that's tough for them to buy into given the process. But once we sort of walk them through the technical details, the great thing is they don't have to change molds or process conditions or anything else. They can just suddenly have recyclable content in their product because it is literally identical. It has the same quality, same performance, won't degrade over time in the recycle loop. So that's what's so compelling about this technology is it really is a long-term infinite solution, much more similar to aluminum."

It's just a business that has continually delivered strong performance and growth in a wide range of applications. It started out with hydration, where we have these reusable water bottles replacing single-use plastics. So one of the great things about our recycled content is it's going into durable products predominantly.
We got out of PET a long time ago. So I'm not trying to defend the PET business. I'm actually taking single-use plastic, I'm taking carpet, I'm taking textiles, a very wide range of supply on the raw materials and then turning them into durable products predominantly. And so it goes into a lot of consumer durable appliances, et cetera. We're now going into toys in a variety of different applications. So it's positioned in a lot of markets that already care about being BPA free and products being safe.
As one of our drivers, the performance is far superior to the competing plastics and its durability and resilience and how it holds up over time. And now we got recycled content that we can add in it. That just gives us one more level of differentiation. So we have a long runway of very attractive growth in this business. For when we need to add more capacity, we're still a couple of years out. You have to remember that in '18, we added a significant chunk of capacity in Tritan that we're certainly making progress in filling out, but we still have a few years before we have to add more capacity."

So automotive, which I'll roll tires into as well, I mean, demand came back strongly across the automotive space, whether it's our interlayers, performance films logging in significant record earnings in the fourth quarter or tires demand actually coming back quite strongly in the third and fourth quarter. So demand's come back across the board in that sector as you can see from a lot of external reports.
We're advantaged that a lot of our products go into the luxury market, especially in Advanced Materials. So we benefited from that market, frankly, holding up a bit better last year than the overall market did and how that's continuing to accelerate for us. And then you've got accelerated growth with acoustics and heads-up display doing really well.
Our new next-gen paint protection film and performance films doing incredibly well, a service channel strategy that allowed us to grow a lot of market share in China this year -- or I should say, in '20. I mean that's going to continue to provide growth. So it is a real combination of market and innovation and service model that's driving a lot of that growth. And you know that the margins of these businesses are above segment average and above company average. So you get a lot of mix lift when these things sort of come back.
We've been saying that the volume and mix hit that we took in '19 relative to '18 and '20 versus '19 has a mirror image when it starts coming back, and you start to see that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to see it now. I will note, though, that demand is exceptionally strong across the auto supply chain. And so we are running into logistics constraints and capacity limits and serving all of it. So we're still happy to serve as much as we are, but it's a bit challenging out there on the logistics front right now for a lot of products."

So those are interconnected. So the type of waste plastic we're talking about getting to, if you think about the first methanolysis plant and what we think we're going to do with the CRT, that is what drives us towards that platform revenue value of the $500 million to $1 billion. If we partner with companies around the world to do additional plants, that would be additive to those numbers.
And as far as fill out rate goes, it's a little hard to say. We're highly confident we can sell at the plant in a mix of specialties and packaging. But the rate at which we can upgrade into the specialties -- we're seeing huge customer engagement right now. So we're really excited, but we still have a lot of work to do. I mean the great thing, by the way, is we are using a sort of a high-cost approach to using our existing assets to make recycle content today, right? That's why we're commercial with CamelBak, Nalgene is we do have a alternate process that we're currently using, but it's more expensive, and it's limited capacity.
But -- so it's a way to, if you will, have semi works to build market momentum adoption that allows us to really hit the ground running when methanolysis comes in line to lower our cost and significantly add our capacity. And the CRT, of course, is already being repurposed. It's a very low CapEx way to switch over to reforming plastic. So that, we just continue to scale up. We got delayed in our progress with our collapse in the textiles market. So we just need to catch up now."

But what we -- we've seen -- you've seen tremendous growth and progress and success in the Advanced Materials division, and that's all the specialty products delivering that growth when you look at that volume and mix improvement. When you look at AFP, it's really important to sort of separate out the 2/3 versus the 1/3.
Obviously, the 2/3 is a lot more stable, margins well above the segment average. And even with the aviation headwind of $30 million this year, we think earnings for the 2/3 will get back to and be slightly better than 2019. And so that business -- coatings is demonstrating a lot of strong growth in market recovery. Care chemicals, water treatment, very strong. Our heat transfer fluid business has been very strong. So we got a lot of great businesses doing well there.
And that comment, by the way, both on earnings and strong growth goes back to '18.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments. We're off with an excellent start to 2021, and I'm proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved in just a few short months. We're building momentum, and the strong operational execution of our teams is paying off as the global economy improves. 
There are several highlights I want to cover. First, strong demand from the end of 2020 continued through the first quarter. In many markets, demand is returning to or exceeding 2019 levels. We reported 20% higher adjusted EPS over '19 and 5% over a very strong first quarter last year before we felt the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Consistent with our track record of strong free cash flow, we also delivered record free cash flow of $125 million in the first quarter, which was up substantially from a very strong performance a year ago. We achieved these solid results despite operational logistical headwinds from [indiscernible] I'm incredibly proud of our team in Texas who took proactive steps ahead of the storm to avoid a hard shutdown any of our assets. Then they worked tirelessly to repair and restarter facilities, which helped ensure supply for our customers. 
Thanks to the proactive planning, we were able to safely start with no injuries and well ahead of our competitors. We had half of our Texas manufacturing facility operational within 1 week of the storm, and we're more than 95% operational within 3 weeks. To all the Eastman employees who sacrifice and rose to the challenge, thank you on behalf of our customers and all of the colleagues at Eastman. 
Moving to other highlights. We've made significant progress with our circular economy efforts, which I'll talk more about in a moment, and our progress hasn't gone unnoticed with Barrons adding Eastman to its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies for 2021, a true honor for us. And we issued our inclusion and diversity report, which you can find on our website. At Eastman, we take our environmental, social and governance commitment seriously, and transparency is the utmost importance. 
We also continue to allocate our capital with returns to stockholders in mind. To that end, we recently completed a small bolt-on acquisition of 3M Food and Feed, a leading animal health and nutrition company accelerate growth in the [indiscernible] business. And finally, we think the favorable trends in the economy, coupled with our innovation investments and continued disciplined cost management, sets us up for strong EPS and free cash flow growth this year and next. 
On our January call, we gave you an update on the progress we're making to become a leader in the circular economy. We announced that we're building one of the world's largest plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling facilities at our site in Kingsport, Tennessee. Since then, we've broken ground on the facility and continue to target mechanical completion by the end of '22. 
Even more impressive is the amount of momentum we're building with customers in many different markets around the world. The demand for our new branded products include Eastman Tritan Renew. Eastman Cristal Renew is strong. At this point, demand for our specialty products and the circular economy offerings has been better than we anticipated. 
And specific to the new facility we announced, we're ahead of schedule in terms of customer demand for the capacity. We have a robust pipeline for additional announcements throughout the year and look forward to sharing those with you. 
Turning to our outlook. As we entered the second quarter with strong demand and mix momentum, we also expect to benefit from cost discipline, including lower operating costs from our operational transformation program. However, there are specific headwinds we face, including maintenance turnaround, supplier reliability and some slowdown in auto production. In addition, we have price increases that are continuing to catch up to higher raw material, energy and distribution costs in some products. Despite these headwinds, we expect a sequential increase in EPS with second quarter adjusted EPS expected to be at or above second quarter of 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.22. 
Moving the full year, we expect strong market growth and product mix improvement to continue. Our innovation-driven growth model will enable us to grow faster than the underlying market recovery, and we expect a number of markets will be rebuilding inventory. We also expect much of the capacity constraints, supply reliability and logistics headwinds to lessen alongside a potential moderation in tight commodity markets. 
We expect to continue to benefit from about $100 million of full year tailwind for improved capacity utilization compared to last year when we aggressively managed inventory well below the decline in demand with our focus on cash. And we're on track to keep our cost structure flat compared to 2020 and well below 2019 and '18 levels. We, therefore, expect adjusted EPS will be about -- be between $8.25 and $8.75 for the full year of '21. On cash, we expect free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations for stronger adjusted EBITDA. We expect 2021 will be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow greater than $1 billion, and we will work to grow free cash flow from here. 
Putting it all together. These outstanding results remind me about what gives Eastman this incredible resiliency and strategic advantage. First and foremost, it's the people at Eastman who continue to persevere and help us win as we saw during the time crisis, and this is we see every day from this team. And as I reflect on how we position our company through the global trade disruptions of 2019 and then COVID in '20, I feel confident in our ability to grow EPS and cash off this new level of earnings. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop over the last several years, we have not sacrificed our efforts to innovate and invest in our specialty portfolio and expect those investments to continue to pay off as we finish off '21 and move into '22. 
In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on what we can control, remain convicted to long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

We're really excited about what we're doing on our chemical recycling technologies, both our cellulosic recycling technology as well as our methanolysis. To your question around the methanolysis plant that we announced in January, we are seeing incredibly strong interest from our customers. And they're really compelled by our value proposition that has 3 key elements that's driving their interest. I mean the first is that we have a solution to plastic waste that cannot be mechanically recycled, much of which ends up in landfill or in the environment. And we can use that as feedstock to upscale into more durable products from the packaging applications or carpet and other applications that we're sourcing. And we can do it with infinite loop, so that's incredibly important is to have that solution. 
Equally important to them is that there's no compromise on the polymer in its performance and quality and as a drop in replacement. Because we're rebuilding building blocks to be identical to what we normally get from fossil fuels, the product is identical. And so it's an easy drop, they're an easy switch over to our offering, and they don't have to change the brand position and the quality of what we provide. 
And the third element that's very important to everyone is that has lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels. We want to solve the waste crisis, but we also need to be sensitive to climate at the same time, and there's no toxic waste. So it is a great story that they want to embrace and have in their brands. And so we've seen a number of customers, as you've seen on the chart with supplied in the prepared remarks, the customers adopting. So Lauder is a great win that we're really excited about. And there's many other companies in the cosmetic packaging area as well as all these other fast-moving consumer goods, et cetera, that are working with us right now. So we are ahead in securing volume. We're also ahead in securing the value that we wanted to get for this offering, and that's also coming in a bit better. We're not going to provide details on exactly what the volume percent of that is. But I can tell you were well at pace in selling out that facility, which is really exciting for us. 
So overall, I'd say it's really, really encouraging."

Obviously, pricing is a very hot topic these days with a material increase in raw material and distribution costs. And we've talked about this a number of times in the past. And I'm going to revisit just what our philosophy is around pricing and value management and then talk a bit about how we view it relative to the journey we've been on since '18. 
First and foremost, in the specialty business, you focus on how you get the best value for your products and selling the value of the products more so than raw material dynamics. And our strategy is completely centered on innovation and driving significant mix upgrade and growth in high-value markets that significantly improve our margins through that mix. So if you're going to do that, and you think about a lot of the markets that we're in where we have the same set of customers for decades, you have to have a strong relationship with those customers through the years if you want to continue to innovate with them and help them succeed and win and grow the market. So that factors into your pricing strategy. And so we want to have stability for us in our spreads and as much as possible for our customers in pricing with the dynamics of raw materials. 
So as we do that, we want to share some of the value when raw materials go down, and we want to recover prices when raw materials go up. From a multiyear point of view, I think we've done an excellent job in managing price. If you go back to 2018, as a reference point, that was a very strong raw material environment, in fact, stronger so far than this year when we look at year-over-year increase and what we expect. And we're able to maintain price increases and maintain stable spreads relative to '17, the back half of that year. And that was the strongest earnings year we had until this year. So good reference point. 
So '19 and '20 with the impact of COVID and before that, the China trade war, we saw a pretty significant drop in volume and mix, it also led to drop in raw material prices. And shared some of that with customers, but we still expanded spreads to offset some of that volume and mix headwind that we had. And as we go into '20, our expectations are that -- and as we're increasing prices, beginning in the first quarter, more so in the second quarter, and we'll continue to do in the back half of the year, we'll get our spreads for the year in the specialties, working towards the 2018 levels, including the headwinds that we have in tires, adhesives and fibers. So making good progress in improving spreads to offset some of those headwinds and getting back towards that '18 level. 
So that, I think, is a great story and one that you want to do because the story for us on the specialties is volume and mix improvement is really significant. You saw it in the first quarter, and you're going to continue to see it through the rest of the year. 
Another thing to keep in mind as you're trying to compare our pricing relative to peers is we put mix in volume, where most of our peers put mix in price. So just to give you an example, if you looked at the Q1 in Advanced Materials, if I moved mix over into price like our peers have it, we'd be up 10% in price and up 5% in volume. So just giving you an idea of the significance of mix in our strategy, which we've been explaining and talking about since 2014, is the secret to our success in leveraging the best returns from our assets. 
Another way you can look at it, of course, is also at EBIT margins where you can look at first quarter EBIT margins and AM improving 370 basis points in this story. AM has doubled -- more than doubled their EBITDA margins when you look at where we expect to be this year. 
And full company margins, I'd also mention, are probably -- are expected to be equal 2 or greater than 2018. So we're very confident about our ability to maintain and manage pricing. Obviously, CI is going to have much better spreads in the current market conditions to add to the story. And CI also provides a nice balance to the specialty. So as prices are catching up and the specialties, the CI spreads expand, and that sort of balances each other out. So I think it's a good story. And as always, we're focused on innovation."

So I mean, first of all, it's obviously a pretty significant improvement in our outlook today from where we were in January. And Mike, that's really driven by a material improvement in the volume and mix growth that we're seeing -- saw in the first quarter, but the momentum we're seeing going into this quarter and into the back end of the year. So volume mix is, as I said just a moment ago, the sort of heart of our strategy and will continue to be how we improve earnings this year. So that's the biggest driver. Obviously, we have tight underlying markets in the Chemical Intermediates businesses that's providing that spread expansion I just mentioned to offset some of the lag and our prices catching up in some of the other products. So one of the uncertainties, obviously, is where the spreads in CI go. 
On the cost front, we feel very confident about it. It's getting our costs out. The operational transformation program is doing a great job of offsetting the return of short-term actions we took last year. And remember, that's over a $200 million program that doesn't just help this year, but also will help going into '22, so we feel good about that. Or you can look at relative to last year, the $100 million utilization tailwind that we have from '20 into '21. I'm feeling very confident about that. So lower-cost structure relative to '18 and utilization tailwind relative to '20. So all of that has continued to be in place. So it's really about volume mix getting better, about spreads being better and then trying to guess, frankly, at how spreads in CI may moderate in the back half of the year. We're assuming some moderation as some of the tightness that we're seeing at some point will go to more normal balanced market conditions. A little hard to call that, and that's one of the drivers of the uncertainty, along with the macroeconomic recovery we all face with COVID and all the other uncertainties that are always out there."

So as is I said, we're really excited about methanolysis and where we think it can take us. And we are trying to be a leader to demonstrate that the plastic waste crisis can be solved within plastic. Plastic is in many applications, by far, the best",643,"Sure. So as is I said, we're really excited about methanolysis and where we think it can take us. And we are trying to be a leader to demonstrate that the plastic waste crisis can be solved within plastic. Plastic is in many applications, by far, the best product for the market. It has the lowest carbon footprint versus alternative materials, whether it's glass, paper, aluminum, in many cases. So we want to keep plastic being the best solution for climate by far. And -- but we got address the waste crisis. So we do have to have a way of scaled up, and I think we're demonstrating how to do that. It's important to remember that we're upscaling plastic waste into durable applications. We're not trying to sort of defend a large single-use plastic business and what we're doing. So that allows us to get a lot of incremental growth in durables at high values as well as better margins. And so we haven't been focused in this first investment on really leaning in on the PET business. From a cost point of view, to answer to your question, the costs are modestly higher than PET or copolyesters today at oil prices around where they are today. If oil prices go up, that equation changes on a relative cost basis. And what we see is a real detachment now from this business from the sort of fuel stock market, right? When you look at PET trading at 60%, 80% premiums to -- in our PET relative to fossil fuel PET in Europe, you know that there's a completely different economic proposition going on around recycled PET or recycled specialty polyesters that we're making. 
But we do think there's a significant opportunity to scale this up. And in fact, we don't just have customers calling us around wanting our specialty products for what we can do with recycled content. We also have customers talking to us about how we could significantly scale up and make PET for their needs around packaging. 
We have customers calling us. We have peers calling us. We have governments calling us and asking us, can you sort of work with us to solve this problem. And so we're engaging in those conversations and trying to figure out which set of those opportunities makes the most sense for us. I want to be very clear for everyone who's listening, we are not getting back into the normal PET business that we got out of it in 2011. We're staying out of it. So if we choose to get back, it's going to be in more of an airgas model on how we engage with solving this problem and scaling up, which means that we'll provide technology, construction, operations, feedstock sourcing. And as we build multiple plants, we'll have all the operational technical know-how that gives us an advantage in how we can do all that for our potential partners. 
We will have long-term contracts to secure all the demand that -- where we will not take market volatility risk relative to feedstock prices. And both from a capital allocation point of view, we'll likely be more of an equity participation in partnerships as opposed to putting this entirely on our balance sheet. So very different model, more like air gas. And we'll see how those conversations go. I think the need is there. Lots of people are making very significant commitments. In Europe, they're facing very significant taxes. And to your first point, we are moving faster probably than many others because we did practice methanolysis for a very long time as part of Kodak. And so we have a lot of technical and operational expertise that's allowing us to move very quickly in how we build this up. have a robust capability with a wide set of feedstocks."

P.J., so first of all, we don't sell propylene, right? We sell derivatives from propylene as you just noted. And so we saw very strong pricing momentum before you were hit in all of our grids because the market conditions were tight. Obviously, you remade the markets even tighter. And as a result, those derivative prices have held up quite well, and they're going to continue to increase, increase in a pretty significant way into the second quarter. 
You have to remember that most of our propylene is made from propane that we buy, RGP being converted into propylene and some supply agreements that are propane based in their pricing, not propylene based. So we're not buying a lot of merchant propylene in our total feed mix. So -- and the spreads are good and attractive. The driver markets continue to remain tight. And we think we're going to have a very good second quarter. It's also important to note at the segment level, when you're trying to interpret these results in CI, there's more than olefins in this segment. So 25% of our revenue is actually functional amines, which has had a tremendous and very steady track record of improving earnings from '18 through to now and is on to a great track. And the vast majority of that business is on cost pass-through contracts. Same is true with a number of our acetic and hydro customers. 
And so our strategy is to have stable earnings in CI, not to have really volatile ones as we're trying to be more of a specialty company, more predictable in our earnings and cash flow. That gave us stability in '19 and '20 relative to '18. And it's going to give us stability this year, but we're not going to be popping up on spot prices as much as some others."

So in our polyester chains, ethyl chains and olefin chains, that's, for the most part, a way we provide significant reliability to our customers that compare it to some of our competitors. And through the first quarter, I received a number of calls from a very important large customers thanking us for our demonstrated reliability that they deeply appreciated and how well we got through the storm and supplied them. 
But the one place that we're not vertically integrated is from acetyl to our interlayers. We don't make VAM and rely on market suppliers for VAM. So the shortages that we saw there has created a constraint for us in interlayers. It is specific to the interlayer business. But we were already having sort of supply problems with some acetyl unreliability in the fourth quarter. Then the number of plants were down about 3 weeks ahead of the storm due to unplanned outages. So the market was already tight, then Uri took about 25% of global VAM market offline. And while they're back operational, they're not near full rates. So it's really created a pretty significant global VAM shortage, as you know. And prices are high, and the volumes are forcing us to cut back on how much interlayers we can make here in the second quarter. So that's the one place out of our total portfolio where I have a supply-related problem, and it is for a lack of vertical integration. 
But we're getting through it. The teams have done a phenomenal job of sourcing VAM from all places around the world, overcoming incredibly complex logistics, which is going to help us resolve this here pretty quickly.

The recovery of AM was substantial, and a good part of that was Asia coming back to life. So if you go back to 2020, and looked at our performance relative to '19, we had very strong performance in AFP and CI. And we actually had 15% growth overall for the company relative to '19, which is a bit unusual relative to others in the marketplace. So we were going against a really tough comp. But AM was one place that did face challenges in Asia. Supply chain and interlayers is really short, as an example, and as well as buying films on cars. So that led to some of the spike up. Demand trending-wise, though, has held up really well, so well, Asia recovery. And we had growth in North America and Europe as well in the quarter. 
What I'd say is, Asia is less of a source of growth for AM and for the company in the second quarter. In the second quarter, the big driver of growth is North America as you might expect where the economy here is starting to recover quite well. And China had already started to recover a year ago in the second quarter. So as you follow COVID recovery around the world, just sort of our revenue sort of follows that trend. And Europe is still lagging and expect it to be better as we move into the back half of the year. 
So -- but the overall momentum is good. Demand is incredibly strong in our specialty plastics business across a number of products, Tritan, but not just Tritan, our copolyesters as well. But Tritan, in particular, is just dramatically better, driven by the normal value proposition we have, better performance in BPA free, but the circular economy is adding to a lot of growth for us and engagement with customers. So much so that we were planning on converting a copolyester line to try them 2 years from now. And we're now having to pull that conversion forward to now and getting it done by -- at the end of this quarter to be able to serve the trade growth and demand that is so strong. So that's going really well. 
And then Performance Films, back to your original question around that. That's a great story, right? We're winning on 3 dimensions. We've got the best product portfolio and performance, especially with our Gen 3 paint protection film that's dramatically better than our competition. We have a great channel strategy to grow through dealers and aftermarket. And we've rolled out a new software system for patterning, the installation of PPF on cars, which is incredibly important and better than our competitors, which helps them quickly install and precisely install the product. And we have the best dealer network around the world and have put a lot of effort into making that dealer network better. So that business is going to have a great year. It was an incredible first quarter. A little bit of that was some restocking of inventory in China, but we expect the momentum for the rest of the year to be strong on all 3 segments, especially when we get back past this supply constraint in interlayers and have more capacity for trying."

So if you want to look at our total integrated acetyl stream, including all the specialties that we make in Advanced Materials and AFP and fibers, the margins that we have and the stability of those margins is extremely attractive. But if you want to just look at in isolation and what we do in CI, which is [indiscernible] and hydride that isn't being used for making specialties. We're selling the co-product of acetic acid for when we make cellulosics. That business is limited to those market conditions. And those market conditions are not as attractive. We do lock out in sort of stable cost passer contracts and high drive and that gives us nice stable earnings, but it doesn't allow us to have big pops or drops in that profitability from year-to-year. So it's totally different. 
So from a vertical integration point of view, the place where we're not vertically integrated is when we bought Solutia and picked up the interlayers business that buys VAM and PVOH as the raw materials. We didn't forward integrate into making those raw materials because our strategy is to deploy capital predominantly in our specialties. But it is very frustrating right now when we're being shorted on those products and paying very high prices for them as we're trying to keep our auto  customer or glass customers in the auto OEM supply."

But we don't do a lot of formulation of those products. So this acquisition, combined with investments we've been making over the last several years in our sort of formulation and application development capability can dramatically accelerate our ability to actually formulate more comprehensive solutions to these challenges and leverage that growth. And the formulations get significantly higher value than selling the assets by 2 to 4x depending on the application. So it's a real classic mixed play for our strategy everywhere else in our company, of creating higher value formulations, capturing a lot more value for that solution to our customers. And this acquisition brings in a lot of capability and a nice existing marketplace in Spain of products that we can then take around the globe given our broader commercial footprint. So there's a huge upside just on our global sales capability relative to their focus on Spain."

So I think the margin profile for Advanced Materials speaks for itself if you want to look at the last decade, right? Just dramatic improvement. We said this, I remember having these conversation",582,"David, great to here from you, and thanks for the question. So I think the margin profile for Advanced Materials speaks for itself if you want to look at the last decade, right? Just dramatic improvement. We said this, I remember having these conversations back in 2010, '11, where we made a lot of investments in asset capability and application development capability, but we added a lot of fixed cost, built Tritan. And we said, look, when this starts to sell and grow, the fixed cost leverage is going to be incredibly impressive. 
If you go back to the 2018 Innovation Day presentation of materials, we laid it all out for you on how fixed cost leverage works in this business. So in that sense, I think as we look at the margins this year, which will be quite attractive. And as we go forward, we think these margins will continue to improve. 
Now they're not going to improve like they did from '20 to '21, obviously, because we took such a hit on asset utilization, especially in Advanced Materials as we're pulling inventory down in interlayers and performance films. You have to remember, specialty plastics actually grew earnings last year relative to '19. So they provided nice stability relative to the auto exposure we had in interlayers and PF. 
But as we continue to grow the circular economy, which is a value up and better margins, as we continue to grow products like Tritan and everything else, whether it's the paint protection films or pretty much anything in performance films has very attractive margins. The acoustics, heads-up display interlayers, very attractive. Electronic vehicles are another big lever for us where we see significant upside. So it turns out to need a lot more glass than an EV. When you put batteries that our need people, the head goes up into the ceiling of the car because you don't want to raise the roof hike because of Aerodynamics. And so what they're doing is making windshield bigger and putting on bigger sun roofs to not make the cabin claustrophobic. So we're getting a lot more real estate of the car in glass with every EV. And then they have much higher functionality requirements in that space. So they want better acoustics. When you don't have the engine noise, which is sort of white noise, you now have more other noises that people focus on, they're more sensitive to, and you actually have to not just have more acoustic, but you have to be able to have the capability to tune it to different frequency bands. They still want heads-up display for safety reasons. They want more color that they're using in parts of the windows as part of how they're adding more glass. And they want solar rejection to reduce air conditioning load. So all these functionalities in, it takes tremendous technical sophistication to put all that functionality into 1 interlayer. And we're the world leader in how to do that. And so when we look at EVS, it's probably 2 to 3x more value per car that we're capturing. And we already have some great adoption on some of these products with a very significant leader in this space. And we expect that to continue across all the brands. So we see volumes growing, mix growing, cost being controlled. Spreads being managed, as I discussed earlier. And so the earnings growth will improve and the margins will will incrementally improve year-to-year."

I mean it will depend on the demand we see for our products internally. And it will depend on this partnership conversation. I mentioned earlier about how we're talking to people about building additional plants around the world that would be focused more on PET than our specialty plastics, but we could take a stream of that output and use it for specialty plastics if we wanted to. But for sure, if you ask me, where are we going to be 5, 10 years from now, our goal, as we said in the sustainability report last December, is to make all of our cellulosic plastics and our polyesters from plastic waste. That's our long-term goal. So we're not stopping at this first plant. And we're -- and what we're seeing so far gives us great confidence that, that vision is possible. It's a very attractive return for shareholders. We get better margins. We get to accelerate growth of our highest value products, and it's just a great story. So yes, I expect we'll be building more than this plant. But we're focused on doing this plant well first and having success in filling it up. And seeing if this alternative business model is something that's going to work with customers and partners. 
I would also note that, that's not our only sustainability play. We've been the original biopolymer company, right? We've been making cellulose acetate for over 100 years and brought it into a wide range of products. So it's a sustainable biopolymer. It's biodegradable in a lot of applications. And now we have a very unique capability on the planet to add recycle content to the other half of that polymer, right? So half of it is made from certified and sustainable forest. The other half today is obviously made from fossil fuels in acetic and hydride to make those cellulosic products. As we add recycled content to the other half of it, it's an extremely compelling polymer compared to anything else on the market because it's it's biopolymer, it's biodegradable, and it has recycled content in it. And based on a wide spectrum of waste plastic, including our ability to take back products from our customers like textiles, right? So now it's just been a phenomenal growth story for us this year and especially in how fast it's recovered in the first quarter. And it's just got a great story as a biopolymer that's led to a lot of success, and now we're adding the renew recycled content part of it to the story. And we expect just a tremendous amount of growth of that. And there's a bunch of cellulosic plastics and Advanced materials that we see in the durable space. And we also think there's probably significant upside in the single-use plastics space as well. And that's a very early stage. So that's a whole another dimension of growth at better margins, higher value, great asset leverage to our existing capacity because there, we don't have to add capital, it's just leveraging existing capability and capacity."

That's the speech I just gave a moment ago about biopolymers and all the opportunities we see to grow in specialty plastics as well as in textiles. So the great good news is it's incremental capital to continue adding plastic waste. And the great thing about the gasifier is that it can take any kind of plastic waste. Mixed plastic waste, which is great. It gives us a unique advantage in buying raw materials because we can buy a puddle of plastic and then separate out the polyester and put in the methanolysis and put the remainder into the gas fire, which gives us the ability to buy very low-cost feedstock that hasn't been into cleaned up.

Before we answer your questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments. We're off with an excellent start to 2021, and I'm proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved in just a few short months. We've been building momentum, and the strong operational execution of our teams is paying off as the global economy improves. 
There are several highlights I want to cover. First, strong demand from the end of 2020 continued through the first quarter. In many markets, demand is returning to or exceeding 2019 levels. We reported 20% higher adjusted EPS over '19 and 5% over a very strong first quarter last year before we felt the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Consistent with our track record of strong free cash flow, we also delivered record free cash flow of $125 million in the first quarter, which was up substantially from a very strong performance a year ago. We achieved these solid results despite operational logistical headwinds from winter storm Uri. I'm incredibly proud of our team in Texas who took proactive steps ahead of the storm to avoid a hard shutdown to any of our assets. Then they worked tirelessly to repair and restart our facilities, which helped ensure supply for our customers. 
Thanks to their proactive planning, we were able to safely start with no injuries and well ahead of our competitors. We had half of our Texas manufacturing facility operational within 1 week of the storm, and we were more than 95% operational within 3 weeks. To all the Eastman employees who sacrificed and rose to the challenge, thank you, on behalf of our customers and all of the colleagues at Eastman. 
Moving to other highlights, we've made significant progress with our circular economy efforts, which I'll talk more about in a moment. And our progress hasn't gone unnoticed with Barron's adding Eastman to its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies for 2021, a true honor for us. And we issued our inclusion and diversity report, which you can find on our website. At Eastman, we take our environmental, social and governance commitment seriously, and transparency is of the utmost importance. 
We also continue to allocate our capital with returns to stockholders in mind. To that end, we recently completed a small bolt-on acquisition of 3F Feed & Food, a leading animal health and nutrition company with accelerated growth in the animal nutrition business. And finally, we think the favorable trends in the economy, coupled with our innovation investments and continued disciplined cost management sets us up for strong EPS and free cash flow growth this year and next. 
On our January call, we gave you an update on the progress we're making to become a leader in the circular economy. We announced that we're building one of the world's largest plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling facilities at our site in Kingsport, Tennessee. Since then, we've broken ground on the facility and continue to target mechanical completion by the end of '22. 
Even more impressive is the amount of momentum we're building with customers in many different markets around the world. The demand for our new branded products include Eastman Tritan Renew, Eastman Cristal Renew, is strong. At this point, demand for our specialty products and the circular economy offerings has been better than we anticipated. 
And specific to the new facility we announced, we're ahead of schedule in terms of customer demand for the capacity. We have a robust pipeline for additional announcements throughout the year and look forward to sharing those with you. 
Turning to our outlook. As we entered the second quarter with strong demand and mix momentum, we also expect to benefit from cost discipline, including lower operating costs from our operational transformation program. However, there are specific headwinds we face, including maintenance turnaround, supplier reliability and some slowdown in auto production. In addition, we have price increases that are continuing to catch up to higher raw material, energy and distribution costs in some products. Despite these headwinds, we expect a sequential increase in EPS, with second quarter adjusted EPS expected to be at or above second quarter of 2018 adjusted EPS of $2.22. 
Moving the full year, we expect strong market growth and product mix improvement to continue. Our innovation-driven growth model will enable us to grow faster than the underlying market recovery, and we expect a number of markets will be rebuilding inventory. We also expect much of the capacity constraints, supplier reliability and logistics headwinds to lessen alongside a potential moderation in tight commodity markets. 
We expect to continue to benefit from about $100 million of full year tailwind for improved capacity utilization compared to last year when we aggressively managed inventory well below the decline in demand with our focus on cash. And we're on track to keep our cost structure flat compared with 2020 and well below 2019 and '18 levels. 
We, therefore, expect adjusted EPS will be about -- be between $8.25 and $8.75 for the full year of '21. On cash, we expect free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations for stronger adjusted EBITDA. We expect 2021 will be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow greater than $1 billion, and we will work to grow free cash flow from here. 
Putting it all together. These outstanding results remind me about what gives Eastman this incredible resiliency and strategic advantage. First and foremost, it's the people at Eastman who continue to persevere and help us win as we saw in Uri and a time of crisis, and this is what we see every day from this good team. 
And as I reflect on how we position our company through the global trade disruptions of 2019 and then COVID in '20, I feel confident in our ability to grow EPS and cash off this new level of earnings. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop over the last several years, we have not sacrificed our efforts to innovate and invest in our specialty portfolio and expect those investments to continue to pay off as we finish off '21 and move into '22. In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Greg."

We're really excited about what we're doing on our chemical recycling technologies, both our cellulosic recycling technology as well as our methanolysis. To your question around the methanolysis plant that we announced in January, we are seeing incredibly strong interest from our customers. And they're really compelled by our value proposition that has 3 key elements that's driving their interest. 
I mean, the first is that we have a solution to plastic waste that cannot be mechanically recycled, much of which ends up in landfill or in the environment. And we can use that as feedstock to upscale into more durable products from the packaging applications or carpet and other applications that we're sourcing. And we can do it with infinite loop, so that's incredibly important, is to have that solution. 
Equally important to them is that there's no compromise on the polymer in its performance and quality and as a drop-in replacement. Because we're rebuilding building blocks to be identical to what we normally get from fossil fuels, the product is identical. And so it's an easy drop-in, an easy switch over to our offering, and they don't have to change the brand position and the quality of what we provide. 
And the third element that's very important to everyone is that it has lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels. We want to solve the waste crisis, but we also need to be sensitive to climate at the same time, and there's no toxic waste. 
So it is a great story that they want to embrace and have in their brands. And so we've seen a number of customers, as you've seen on the chart we supplied in the prepared remarks, the customers adopting. Estée Lauder is a great win that we're really excited about. And there's many other companies in the cosmetic packaging area as well as all these other fast-moving consumer goods, et cetera, that are working with us right now.
So we are ahead in securing volume. We're also ahead in securing the value that we wanted to get for this offering, and that's also coming in a bit better. We're not going to provide details on exactly what the volume percent of that is. But I can tell you, were well ahead of pace in selling out that facility, which is really exciting for us. So overall, I'd say it's really, really encouraging."

Obviously, pricing is a very hot topic these days with a material increase in raw material and distribution costs. And we've talked about this a number of times in the past.

Obviously, pricing is a very hot topic these days with a material increase in raw material and distribution costs. And we've talked about this a number of times in the past. And I'm going to revisit just what our philosophy is around pricing and value management and then talk a bit about how we view it relative to the journey we've been on since '18.
First and foremost, in the specialty business, you focus on how you get the best value for your products and selling the value of the products more so than raw material dynamics. And our strategy is completely centered on innovation and driving significant mix upgrade and growth in high-value markets that significantly improve our margins through that mix. 
So if you're going to do that, and you think about a lot of the markets that we're in where we have the same set of customers for decades, you have to have a strong relationship with those customers through the years if you want to continue to innovate with them and help them succeed and win and grow the market. 
So that factors into your pricing strategy. And so we want to have stability for us in our spreads and as much as possible for our customers in pricing with the dynamics of raw materials. So as we do that, we want to share some of the value when raw materials go down, and we want to recover prices when raw materials go up. 
From a multiyear point of view, I think we've done an excellent job in managing price. If you go back to 2018 as a reference point, that was a very strong raw material environment. In fact, stronger so far than this year when we look at year-over-year increase and what we expect. And we're able to maintain price increases and maintain stable spreads relative to '17, in the back half of that year. And that was the strongest earnings year we had until this year. So good reference point. 
So '19 and '20, with the impact of COVID and before that, the China trade war, we saw a pretty significant drop in volume and mix, it also led to drop in raw material prices. And we shared some of that with customers, but we still expanded spreads to offset some of that volume and mix headwind that we had. 
And as we go into '20, our expectations are that -- and as we're increasing prices, beginning in the first quarter, more so in the second quarter, and we'll continue to do in the back half of the year, we'll get our spreads for the year in the specialties, working towards the 2018 levels, including the headwinds that we have in tires, adhesives and fibers. So making good progress in improving spreads to offset some of those headwinds and getting back towards that '18 level. 
So that, I think, is a great story and one that you want to do because the story for us on the specialties is volume and mix improvement, is really significant. You saw it in the first quarter, and you're going to continue to see it through the rest of the year. 
Another thing to keep in mind as you're trying to compare our pricing relative to peers is we put mix in volume, where most of our peers put mix in price. So just to give you an example, if you looked at the Q1 in Advanced Materials, if I moved mix over into price like our peers have it, we'd be up 10% in price and up 5% in volume. So just giving you an idea of the significance of mix in our strategy, which we've been explaining and talking about since 2014, is the secret to our success in leveraging the best returns from our assets.
Another way you can look at it, of course, is also EBIT margins, where you can look at first quarter EBIT margins and AM improving 370 basis points in this story. AM has doubled -- more than doubled their EBITDA margins when you look at where we expect to be this year. 
And full company margins, I'd also mention, are probably -- are expected to be equal to or greater than 2018. So we're very confident about our ability to maintain and manage pricing. Obviously, CI is going to have much better spreads in the current market conditions to add to the story. And CI also provides a nice balance to the specialty. So as prices are catching up in the specialties, the CI spreads expand, and that sort of balances each other out. So I think it's a good story. And as always, we're focused on innovation."

So I mean, first of all, it's obviously a pretty significant improvement in our outlook today from where we were in January. And Mike, that's really driven by a material improvement in the volume and mix growth that we're seeing -- saw in the first quarter, but the momentum we're seeing going into this quarter and into the back end of the year. So volume mix is, as I said just a moment ago, the sort of heart of our strategy and will continue to be how we improve earnings this year. So that's the biggest driver. 
Obviously, we have tight underlying markets in the Chemical Intermediates businesses that's providing that spread expansion I just mentioned to offset some of the lag and our prices catching up in some of the other products. So one of the uncertainties, obviously, is where the spreads in CI go. 
On the cost front, we feel very confident about it. It's getting our costs out. The operational transformation program is doing a great job of offsetting the return of short-term actions we took last year. And remember, that's over a $200 million program that doesn't just help this year, but also will help going into '22. So we feel good about that, or you can look at relative to last year, the $100 million utilization tailwind that we have from '20 into '21. I'm feeling very confident about that. 
So lower-cost structure relative to '18 and utilization tailwind relative to '20. So all of that has continued to be in place. So it's really about volume mix getting better, about spreads being better and then trying to guess, frankly, at how spreads in CI may moderate in the back half of the year. 
We're assuming some moderation as some of the tightness that we're seeing at some point will go to more normal balanced market conditions. A little hard to call that, and that's one of the drivers of the uncertainty, along with the macroeconomic recovery we all face with COVID and all the other uncertainties that are always out there."

So as is I said, we're really excited about methanolysis and where we think it can take us. And we are trying to be a leader to demonstrate that the plastic waste crisis can be solved within plastic. Plastic is, in many applications by far, the best",645,"Sure. So as is I said, we're really excited about methanolysis and where we think it can take us. And we are trying to be a leader to demonstrate that the plastic waste crisis can be solved within plastic. Plastic is, in many applications by far, the best product for the market. It has the lowest carbon footprint versus alternative materials, whether it's glass, paper, aluminum, in many cases. So we want to keep plastic being the best solution for climate by far. And -- but we got address the waste crisis. So we do have to have a way to scale it up, and I think we're demonstrating how to do that. 
It's important to remember that we're upscaling plastic waste into durable applications. We're not trying to sort of defend a large single-use plastic business and what we're doing. So that allows us to get a lot of incremental growth in durables at high values as well as better margins. And so we haven't been focused in this first investment on really leaning in on the PET business. 
From a cost point of view, to answer to your question, the costs are modestly higher than PET or copolyesters, like oil prices around where they are today. If oil prices go up, that equation changes on a relative cost basis. And what we see is a real detachment now from this business, from the sort of fuel stock market, right? When you look at PET trading at 60%, 80% premiums to -- in our PET relative to fossil fuel PET in Europe, you know that there's a completely different economic proposition going on around recycled PET or recycled specialty polyesters that we're making. 
But we do think there's a significant opportunity to scale this up. And in fact, we don't just have customers calling us around, wanting our specialty products for what we can do with recycled content. We also have customers talking to us about how we could significantly scale up and make PET for their needs around packaging. We have customers calling us. We have peers calling us. We have governments calling us and asking us, can you sort of work with us to solve this problem? And so we're engaging in those conversations and trying to figure out which set of those opportunities makes the most sense for us. 
I want to be very clear for everyone who's listening, we are not getting back into the normal PET business that we got out of it in 2011. We're staying out of it. So if we choose to get back, it's going to be more of an Airgas model on how we engage with solving this problem and scaling up, which means that we'll provide technology, construction, operations, feedstock sourcing. And as we build multiple plants, we'll have all the operational technical know-how that gives us an advantage in how we can do all that for our potential partners. 
We will have long-term contracts to secure all the demand that -- where we will not take market volatility risk relative to feedstock prices. And -- but from a capital allocation point of view, it will likely be more of an equity participation in partnerships as opposed to putting this entirely on our balance sheet. So very different model, more like air gas. And we'll see how those conversations go. I think the need is there. Lots of people are making very significant commitments. In Europe, they're facing very significant taxes. 
And to your first point, we are moving faster probably than many others because we did practice methanolysis for a very long time as part of Kodak. And so we have a lot of technical and operational expertise that's allowing us to move very quickly in how we build this up and have a robust capability with a wide set of feedstocks."

And then coming back to more nitty-gritty, on CI, as I understood after the Texas freeze, as ethylene and other commodities spiked, propylene prices collapsed by 50% because I think refinery started up before the polypropylene plant started up. And so I guess it's hard to understand from outside, but I would have expected a benefit from lower refinery grade propylene for you and higher propylene derivative prices. But can you just explain what happened with the propylene chain? And what was the benefit? Or why didn't we see more?"

P.J., so first of all, we don't sell propylene, right? We sell derivatives from propylene as you just noted. And so we saw very strong pricing momentum before Uri hit in all of our grids because the market conditions were tight. Obviously, Uri made the markets even tighter. And as a result, those derivative prices have held up quite well, and they're going to continue to increase, increase in a pretty significant way into the second quarter. 
You have to remember that most of our propylene is made from propane that we buy, RGP being converted into propylene and some supply agreements that are propane based in their pricing, not propylene based. So we're not buying a lot of merchant propylene in our total feed mix. So -- and the spreads are good and attractive. The derivative markets continue to remain tight. And we think we're going to have a very good second quarter. 
It's also important to note at the segment level, when you're trying to interpret these results in CI, there's more than olefins in this segment. So 25% of our revenue is actually functional amines, which has had a tremendous and very steady track record of improving earnings from '18 through to now and is on to a great track. And the vast majority of that business is on cost pass-through contracts. Same is true with a number of our acetic anhydride customers. 
And so our strategy is to have stable earnings in CI, not to have really volatile ones as we're trying to be more of a specialty company, more predictable in our earnings and cash flow. That gave us stability in '19 and '20 relative to '18. And it's going to give us stability this year, but we're not going to be popping up on spot prices as much as some others."

That's for the most part, a way we provide significant reliability to our customers that -- compared to some of our competitors. And through the first quarter, I received a number of calls from our very important large customers, thanking us for our demonstrated reliability that they deeply appreciated and how well we got through the storm and supplied them. 
But the one place that we're not vertically integrated is from acetyl to our interlayers. We don't make VAM and rely on market suppliers for VAM. So the shortages that we saw there has created a constraint for us in interlayers. It is specific to the interlayer business. But we were already having sort of supply problems with some acetyl unreliability in the fourth quarter. Then the number of plants were down about 3 weeks ahead of the storm due to unplanned outages. So the market was already tight, then Uri took about 25% of global VAM market off-line. And while they're back operational, they're not near to full rates. 
So it's really created a pretty significant global VAM shortage, as you know. And prices are high, and the volumes are forcing us to cut back on how much interlayers we can make here in the second quarter. So that's the one place out of our total portfolio where I have a supply-related problem, and it is for a lack of vertical integration. 
But we're getting through it. The teams have done a phenomenal job of sourcing VAM from all places around the world, overcoming incredibly complex logistics, which is going to help us resolve this here pretty quickly. And it will help us not just now but how to have a better diverse supply base in the future."

The recovery of AM was substantial, and a good part of that was Asia coming back to life. So if you go back to 2020, and looked at our performance relative to '19, we had very strong performance in AFP and CI. And we actually had 15% growth overall for the company relative to '19, which is a bit unusual relative to others in the marketplace. So we were going against a really tough comp. 
But AM was one place that did face challenges in Asia. Supply chain and interlayers is really short, as an example, and as well as buying films on cars. So that led to some of the spike up. Demand, trending-wise though, has held up really well, so -- well, Asia recovery. And we had growth in North America and Europe as well in the quarter. 
What I'd say is, Asia is less of a source of growth for AM and for the company in the second quarter. In the second quarter, the big driver of growth is North America as you might expect where the economy here is starting to recover quite well. And China had already started to recover a year ago in the second quarter. So as you follow COVID recovery around the world, just sort of our revenue sort of follows that trend. And Europe is still lagging and expect it to be better as we move into the back half of the year. 
So -- but the overall momentum is good. Demand is incredibly strong in our specialty plastics business across a number of products, Tritan. But it's not just Tritan, our copolyesters as well. But Tritan demand in particular is just dramatically better, driven by the normal value proposition we have, better performance in BPA free. But the circular economy is adding to a lot of growth for us and engagement with customers. So much so that we were planning on converting a copolyester line to Tritan 2 years from now. And we're now having to pull that conversion forward to now and getting it done by -- at the end of this quarter to be able to serve the Tritan growth and demand that is so strong. So that's going really well. 
And then performance films, back to your original question around that. That's a great story, right? We're winning on 3 dimensions. We've got the best product portfolio and performance, especially with our gen 3 paint protection film that's dramatically better than our competition. We have a great channel strategy to grow through dealers and aftermarket. And we've rolled out a new software system for patterning, the installation of PPF on cars, which is incredibly important and better than our competitors, which helps them quickly install and precisely install the product. And we have the best dealer network around the world and have put a lot of effort into making that dealer network better. 
So that business is going to have a great year. It was an incredible first quarter. A little bit of that was some restocking of inventory in China, but we expect the momentum for the rest of the year to be strong on all 3 segments, especially when we get back past this supply constraint in interlayers and have more capacity for Tritan."

So trying to do comparisons of our acetyl business to our friends in Dallas is not a very good exercise because their business is just entirely different than ours. So they're an extremely large player in acetic acid, and then they go forward into VAM and emulsions that, obviously, are enjoying exceptionally tight market conditions and high prices right now. 
We don't make -- we make acetic anhydride, is what we make off of our stream that goes into cellulosic products as well as a variety of other acetyl or polyester products or olefin products where there's an acetyl component. But we don't go into that VAM emulsion business at all. 
So if you want to look at our total integrated acetyl stream, including all the specialties that we make in Advanced Materials and AFP and fibers, the margins that we have and the stability of those margins is extremely attractive. But if you want to just look at in isolation and what we do in CI, which is sell acetic anhydride that isn't being used for making specialties, we're selling the co-product of acetic acid for when we make cellulosics. That business is limited to those market conditions. And those market conditions are not as attractive. We do lock out in sort of stable cost pass-through contracts, anhydride and that gives us nice stable earnings, but it doesn't allow us to have big pops or drops in that profitability from year-to-year. So it's totally different. 
So from a vertical integration point of view, the place where we're not vertically integrated is when we bought Solutia and picked up the interlayers business that buys VAM and PVOH as the raw materials. We didn't forward integrate into making those raw materials because our strategy is to deploy capital predominantly in our specialties. But it is very frustrating right now when we're being shorted on those products and paying very high prices for them as we're trying to keep our auto  customer -- or glass customers in the auto OEM supply."

But we don't do a lot of formulation of those products.
So this acquisition, combined with investments we've been making over the last several years in our sort of formulation and application development capability can dramatically accelerate our ability to actually formulate more comprehensive solutions to these challenges and leverage that growth. And the formulations get significantly higher value than selling the assets by 2 to 4x depending on the application. So it's a real classic mixed play for our strategy everywhere else in our company, of creating higher value formulations, capturing a lot more value for that solution to our customers.

So I think the margin profile for Advanced Materials speaks for itself if you want to look at the last decade, right? Just dramatic improvement. We said this, I remember having these conversation",580,"David, great to hear from you, and thanks for the question. So I think the margin profile for Advanced Materials speaks for itself if you want to look at the last decade, right? Just dramatic improvement. We said this, I remember having these conversations back in 2010, '11, where we made a lot of investments in asset capability, in application development capability, but we added a lot of fixed cost, built Tritan. And we said, look, when this starts to sell and grow, the fixed cost leverage is going to be incredibly impressive. 
If you go back to the 2018 Innovation Day presentation of Advanced Materials, we laid it all out for you on how fixed cost leverage works in this business. So in that sense, I think as we look at the margins this year, which will be quite attractive and as we go forward, we think these margins will continue to improve. 
Now they're not going to improve like they did from '20 to '21, obviously, because we took such a hit on asset utilization, especially in Advanced Materials as we're pulling inventory down in interlayers and performance films. You have to remember, specialty plastics actually grew earnings last year relative to '19. So they provided nice stability relative to the auto exposure we had in interlayers and PF. 
But as we continue to grow the circular economy, which is a value up and better margins, as we continue to grow products like Tritan and everything else, whether it's the paint protection films or pretty much anything in performance films has very attractive margins. The acoustics, heads-up display interlayers, very attractive. Electronic vehicles are another big lever for us where we see significant upside. 
So it turns out to need a lot more glass than an EV. When you put batteries underneath people, their head goes up to the ceiling of the car because you don't want to raise the roof height because of aerodynamics. And so what they're doing is making windshields bigger and putting on bigger sunroofs to not make the cabin claustrophobic. So we're getting a lot more real estate of the car in glass with every EV. 
And then they have much higher functionality requirements in that space. So they want better acoustics. When you don't have the engine noise, which is sort of white noise, you now have more -- other noises that people focus on, they're more sensitive to, and you actually have to not just have more acoustics, but you have to be able to have the capability to tune it to different frequency bands. They still want heads-up display for safety reasons. They want more color that they're using in parts of the windows as part of how they're adding more glass. And they want solar rejection to reduce air conditioning load. 
So all these functionalities in, it takes tremendous technical sophistication to put all that functionality into 1 interlayer. And we're the world leader in how to do that. And so when we look at EVs, it's probably 2 to 3x more value per car that we're capturing. And we already have some great adoption on some of these products with a very significant leader in this space. And we expect that to continue across all the brands. So we see volumes growing, mix growing cost being controlled, spreads being managed, as I discussed earlier. And so the earnings growth will improve and the margins will incrementally improve year-to-year."

Do you think you have to start-up the plant first and see how it works? Or if demand is strong enough, could you think about expansions maybe sometime in the next 12 months or so?"
109103,710704832,2264901,"Eastman Chemical Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Eastman Chemical Company","Executives","Yes. So we're not going to wait to start this plant up before we start building another plant necessarily. I mean, it will depend on the demand we see for our products internally, and it will depend on this partnership conversation. I mentioned earlier ab",526,"Yes. So we're not going to wait to start this plant up before we start building another plant necessarily. I mean, it will depend on the demand we see for our products internally, and it will depend on this partnership conversation. I mentioned earlier about how we're talking to people about building additional plants around the world that would be focused more on PET than our specialty plastics, but we could take a stream of that output and use it for specialty plastics if we wanted to. 
But for sure, if you ask me, where are we going to be 5, 10 years from now, our goal, as we said in the sustainability report last December, is to make all of our cellulosic plastics and our polyesters from plastic waste. That's our long-term goal. So we're not stopping at this first plant. And we're -- and what we're seeing so far gives us great confidence that, that vision is possible. 
It's a very attractive return for shareholders. We get better margins. We get to accelerate growth of our highest value products, and it's just a great story. So yes, I expect we'll be building more than this plant, but we're focused on doing this plant well first and having success in filling it up, and seeing if this alternative business model is something that's going to work with customers and partners. 
I would also note that, that's not our only sustainability play. We've been the original biopolymer company, right? We've been making cellulose acetate for over 100 years and brought it into a wide range of products. So it's a sustainable biopolymer. It's biodegradable in a lot of applications. And now we have a very unique capability on the planet to add recycled content to the other half of that polymer, right? So half of it is made from certified and sustainable forest, the other half today is obviously made from fossil fuels in acetic anhydride to make those cellulosic products. 
As we add recycled content to the other half of it, it's an extremely compelling polymer compared to anything else on the market because it's biopolymer, it's biodegradable, and it has recycled content in it and based on a wide spectrum of waste plastic, including our ability to take back products from our customers like textiles, right? 
So Naia has just been a phenomenal growth story for us this year and especially in how fast it's recovered in the first quarter. And it's just got a great story as a biopolymer that's led to a lot of success, and now we're adding the Renew recycled content part of it to the story. And we expected just a tremendous amount of growth of that. And there's a bunch of cellulosic plastics and Advanced Materials that we see in the durable space. And we also think there's probably significant upside in the single-use plastics space as well. And that's very early stage. 
So that's a whole another dimension of growth at better margins, higher value, great asset leverage to our existing capacity because there, we don't have to add capital. It's just leveraging existing capability and capacity."

We're also looking at how we expand, and we're making higher investments this year to ensure that we can capture not only the existing demand, but the future demand, including expanding our interlayers facilities this year. We're bringing on amines capacity as well here in Q2 during the shutdown and as Mark has already highlighted, converting a polymer unit ahead of schedule on Tritan. So -- and we, additionally, we get roughly 2% to 3% capacity creep. So you'll get the cost benefits in Q2, Q3, but more importantly, it's about the mix upgrade and the continued growth that we're focused on and deploying the capital to do that."

So as we think about what we've delivered, we ultimately started our COVID action plans at the end of Q1 last year, and then we accelerated transformational efforts towards the back end. As we came around here into Q1, we benefited from those cost actions year-over-year. I would point out, as you think about also our SG&A line, you probably see that going up a little bit. And as I highlighted, I believe last year, the fact that we had some market-based comp, specifically deferred comp, that was a benefit last year that's not repeating this year just due to the financial market declines. 
But we're well set up and focused, so that those variable margins that we talked about last year fall through to the bottom line. Obviously, there'll be a little bit of denominator math just due to the price inflations that we're dealing with."

So we're really excited about what we're doing with the gasifier and changing it from gasifying coal to what's technically called reforming plastic. And so that plastic waste, we're just getting started, Bob. It's got huge growth potential. That's the speech I just gave a moment ago about biopolymers and all the opportunities we see to grow in specialty plastics as well as in textiles. 
So the great good news is it's incremental capital to continue adding plastic waste. And the great thing about the gasifier is that it can take any kind of plastic waste, mixed plastic waste, which is great. It gives us a unique advantage in buying raw materials because we can buy a puddle of plastic and then separate out the polyester and put it in the methanolysis and put the remainder into the gasifier, which gives us the ability to buy very low-cost feedstock that hasn't been sort of cleaned up. And we're really excited about that. 
So no, we see a tremendous amount of growth in that space, as excited about that as methanolysis and what we can do with our polymer capacity, and we have a lot of capacity to leverage. So no, it's going to be great.

And we're really excited about the results we had in the second quarter. And to your point, really excited about the momentum we're building in our specialties as we go forward into the back half of the year, which will be the driving force for earnings in the back half.
When you think about it, we had strong volume and mix growth in the specialties, especially relative to last year or '19 or even '18 in the progress that we're making. And that momentum will continue into the back half of this year. Now some of that strength in volume and mix growth was offset by sort of temporarily high sort of distribution costs and some of the other supply chain factors that we faced in the second quarter and expect those to abate. So not only do you get the volume and mix growth, you get some improvement in spreads relative to the first half. So that's going to drive a nice improvement for specialties. And I would say that it's going to hold up better, I think, in the fourth quarter than what is normal seasonality as we look at the lack of restocking customers have made to date. And we don't think that they're going to make much progress on it really through this year, and that will extend into next year. So that's a big driver.
In addition to that, you've got lower shutdown costs. A lot of that hit AFP in particular. So you've got that as a benefit. You've got lower operating costs from all of our operational transformation work, and as I mentioned earlier, this distribution coming off the service spike that it was.
There are, of course, headwinds as we expect some moderation in spreads in Chemical Intermediates, and we have increasing gross spend. So there are some factors that offset some of that, but it's definitely much more of a specialty story and how you deliver a back half that's better than the first."

So we're really excited about how -- our circular economy investments are both solving a serious challenge in the planet, a dual challenge really, of getting plastic waste out environment and deploying a technology that avoid us",683,"Yes. Mike, great question. So we're really excited about how -- our circular economy investments are both solving a serious challenge in the planet, a dual challenge really, of getting plastic waste out environment and deploying a technology that avoid using fossil fuels and does it in a way that has a lower carbon footprint than our current traditional process. So really a win on both fronts.
And our customers see that benefit, and it's important. Both elements are really important in the solution. And we've had tremendous engagement. As we talked about in the first quarter, you saw a spectrum of brands signing on to take our recycled content both from our polyester renewal technology as well as our carbon renewal technology into the biopolymers. And getting P&G and Fergonlonar and a variety of other brands to sign on top is putting us in a great position to fill out this first facility that we're building that will come online.
Now we're already getting benefit from this because we have a bridging capacity in place with our current assets. So we're building volume and momentum this year and into next. That's part of our growth story. But with these commitments, we're going to be in a good position to sort of fill out that plant really quickly with specialty products, which is great. And that's the best way to build a plant is when it ramps up full, especially in specialty product line that's not normal and certainly improves the return.
And yes, there are interest in going beyond this. We have, of course, specialty strategy we're really excited about, and we're going to continue to invest in that. But beyond that, a lot of customers out there in the fast-moving consumer goods world still have to do a lot of packaging. And they realize that the best carbon footprint is plastic. It's important to keep that in mind when you think about solving these problems because in our world of polyester, glass has doubled the carbon footprint even with much higher recycling rates than polyester day, and aluminum's 50% higher. So we need to solve this problem. Our brands understand this problem needs to be solved by recycling polymer as the best carbon footprint solution as well as a way to get the waste out of the environment.
So we have a number of countries actually engage with us about how to help them think about solving their waste problem, and we have a number of brands engaged with us on how we would potentially build facilities for their packaging needs that really solves this dual challenge. And  so we're engaged.
But to be clear, we're not going to get back into the sort of merchant PET business. We are happy to get back into making this product, but it's got to be in a more air gas model. We bring a lot to the table in the technology that's proven and scalable. We have a lot of operational capability, a lot of ability to build and scale up facilities as well as operate them really well and a lot of history with methanolysis that allows us to know exactly how to operate this kind of technology, which is difficult when you've got a variable feed stream of content coming into it.
And for what we bring to the table, we want sort of spread stability. So we need to have long-term contracts with customers that give us a sort of predictable margin and as well feel certain we've got access to raw material supply, which is significant but still complicated to access.
So we meet these conditions, we'll for sure build these facilities. And we think that return on capital and the amount of EBITDA each of these facilities could generate would be quite substantial. We're not going to get into the details of that now. But we're really excited about doing this, but it depends on the customers and the countries engaging in the right way. And hopefully, we'll be able to build several of these plants going forward."

Also, over the past couple of years, we've highlighted the fact of the headwinds in the 1/3, many of those being macro with trade, also the competition. So as we assess this business, as you know, the accounting rules don't let us reallocate the goodwill back to the purchase date. So overall, we've got a strong portfolio and have transformed, but we also need to move forward. And I think we've been decisive with those actions.
And yes, it's resulting in a $500 million write-off, but we believe we've contributed -- created a tremendous amount of value. And now we're wanting to focus on what Mark just spoke about, which is investing in the circular economy and growing the 2/3."

So when you think about polyester in the U.S., just around the first point we're building here, there's about 20 billion pounds of polyester waste annually produced in this country that goes into packaging, textiles and carpet. 40% -- only 40% of it is actually packaging. And when you look at what can be mechanically recycled of that 40%, only 25% to 30% can realistically be mechanically recycled, and the vast majority of that recycling is actually into textiles, not back into bottles because you have to have extremely clean polymer to clean up and melt back into a bottle. So it's very limited on how you can actually solve the packaging problem with mechanical recycling. And then all the carpet and textiles pretty much ends up in landfill because mechanical recycling, again, doesn't really have an ability to do something with it.
So under any of these scenarios, when you look at all this waste, and we want as much mechanical recycling to happen as possible because it has a good carbon footprint, it's going to be very limited. And it also doesn't have a long-term life because, through mechanical recycling, the polymer breaks down after sort of 5 cycles. So molecular recycling, which is what we're doing, is essential to really solving this problem. And again, it's essential because the alternative materials have a worse carbon footprint.
So we're really excited to be a leader in how to solve this. And the advantage of being a leader for our feedstock teams are out there engaging on multiple sources is we're way ahead of everyone else and going to commercial scale, right? We only -- in the polyester world, we only have other sort of small start-ups attempting to get into this space on the planet. And they don't have the resources that we have in technology, operations, how to build a skeletal plant, et cetera. So when we engage with the brands, we have a compelling story, not just of a solution but our ability to actually deliver it and be scalable in how we do it.
And when you're willing to assign value to a waste that's going to landfill versus landfill, customer -- suppliers engage quite actively. And so we're feeling very good about being able to access that. So we're not going to get into what the price is. We're keeping our strategy and details of how we're accessing feedstock confidential as a competitive advantage in our point of view, but we're very confident we can access waste at a very affordable level.
And then on the customer side, the customers recognize that recycled content is going to be at a premium. As we shared with you all the way back in January, the premium that RPD is getting relative to fossil fuel-based PET is substantial, 60% to 80% premium in Europe right now. And the premiums aren't that far behind as they're now starting to climb in the U.S. as well. So they know that this is going to cost additional money. And what we can provide is more certainty on the price and predictability than what you can get from the spot or PET market that's at the food-grade level. So that's also part of a value proposition in our Airgas models. While we want to make long -- while we have to have long-term good mines for our customers to make our economics work, it also is structured in a way that gives them a lot more price certainty in how to manage their business. So I think it works for both parties."

And yes, it's quite the recovery in Chemical Intermediates like many other companies who have similar kind of products versus last year. And it's a combination of better volume but significantly better spread that's driving that success in the portfolio.
But before I get to the spread part, I want to just get to the composition of CI first, as you asked. So about 25% of the revenue in CI is actually amines -- functional amines. They're mostly on cost pass-through contracts. And so they've had very steady spread since we've, frankly, bought Taminco in the way their business is structured. And they've had a nice solid steady volume growth over time, delivering very predictable and attractive earnings. And they've got a few accelerants on top of that beyond just the normal ad growth.
So we've got a plant that we just built and are ramping up for Corteva for their Enlist product that's giving us a lot more additional growth on top of that core business. So that's just been a nice, great steady business.
Then you do have plasticizers, which has been a very attractive business. We've been a leader in non-deleplasticizers for a long time. And so we get not just underlying market growth but above-market growth in that business as we've been replacing other plasticizers. And the spreads there, of course, connected to the oil find chain have done quite well this year. But it's not just spreads, it's also a nice growth story with the position we have in that marketplace.
And then you've got olefins and acetyls. Olefins and that set of intermediates that we make there is by far a bigger part of the business than acetyls. And spreads have obviously significantly improved with the dynamics in propylene relative to propane. So that's been a driver of the performance.
Acetyls is a much smaller business for us. And it's important to remember, we're not really in acetic acid very much. It's just a co-product. We make acetic anhydride. We're the largest player in acetic anhydride in the world to make cellulosics, right? So when we look at the value of that stream with all the specialties that are made off of that in Advanced Materials, AFP, and of course, Fibers, the margins are -- that integrated acetyl stream is quite significant and above company average.
So it's really about the olefins part where we're having some benefits, obviously, right now as well as -- at some point, we'll expect moderation. But even there, we've made investments to improve CI and stability. So we have a lot of that business on cost pass-through contracts versus spot because we want a predictable earnings that really showed a lot of benefit in how well CI held up on an annual basis in '19 and '20 relative to '18. So we did quite a bit better than others on that front.
And of course, we're getting a benefit this year. We're not quite the same spot prices as some others might have. And we're happy to make that trade-off. But we've done on other things like the RGP investment, which has been a phenomenal investment to give us the ability to reduce the amount of ethylene we produce when it's not attractive and still make it when it is. So that's been a great way to stabilize that business.
And we've optimized sites like taking Singapore down, which has been one of the highest parts of olefin volatility in our portfolio. And shutting that down will improve, not just earnings but reduce volatility. So a lot of things going on across the board to optimize value here.
And it's important to keep in mind, Chemical Intermediates exists to support the specialties, which are growing really well. And part of the reason you'll see volume going down this business is because the specialties are consuming it so fast in their growth. So overall, it's playing its role, creating the value of reliability for customers, creating value to optimize our cost structure. And we're really proud of the team in how they've optimized value here in the first half of the year."

So part of our commentary is that -- propane was about $0.90 on average in the second quarter. It's $1.10 in July. So you've got some propane headwind. The prices are holding up well.
Now our guidance includes some expectation that prices will start to normalize as we go through the back half of this year. I think there's a wide range of opinions about the rate at which prices may or may not normalize in the back half of the year. I'd say we're probably in the middle of the road on -- relative to the commentary out there, where we expect some but not dramatic. And we said we're getting out of the olefin forecasting business a long time ago, and we're going to stick with that. It's a little hard to predict the pace at which these markets can change.
But appreciate the earnings. It's actually been a nice balance as we're working pricing relative to raws and the specialties. And so these sort of neutralize each other out in some ways. And on the spread front, our strategy is focused on growing high-value volume and mix through innovation in the specialties, which is the vast majority of who we are.

So on the specialty side, I'd say our view is demand is going to be strong and hold up well in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter, so not that normal seasonal drop as we don't see a lot of progress in customers making sort of improvements in their inventory situation, especially in some markets like automotive or construction. And those kind of markets clearly are being sort of rate limited by supply chain challenges in the way they're serving underlying market demand, which is very strong around the world.
And so they're going to continue to want to sort of ramp up production whenever they get raw materials to serve that need. So we think that continues -- that sort of strength continues in the back half of this year, and frankly, into next year in those kind of end markets.
And then you got other steady markets that are just constantly growing like care chemicals, water treatment, ag, et cetera, that will -- that always provides stability. So we think it's going to hold up better on that side. When it comes to Chemical Intermediates, I think I already hit that, which is at some point, we expect normalization of spreads.

It's a nice high-margin product for us and a way to sort of repurpose all of the Fiber's capacity that was making tow.

The challenge we had in the second quarter was the spike in distribution costs on top of the raw materials. A lot of it was just airfreighting, right? So it's not just price per unit delivered, but it's a mode that we had to use to keep our customers supplied. So there just was a tremendous amount of airfreighting going on. We expect that to abate back to more normal modes and as well as sort of calm down a bit.
Now we're getting some price to cover some of those costs, but not all of it, and that's part of the offset that you saw in the second quarter. So as we go into the back half, we feel really quite good about keeping up with raws and managing the distribution total cost. So that's not really our concern. We're focused on just trying to get volume and mix delivered to customers.
And the market demand out there is really good, well above our logistics capabilities that we can access.

We've also talked about how we do maintenance, maintenance turnarounds, I'll call it spans and layers across our operations front. And we've made those implementations at the end of -- I'll call it end of 2020 going into '21. And we expect as that's fully implemented, there will be additional tailwinds from those actions.
Additionally, as we continue to think about leveraging our sites for other partners as another way of creating value and gaining, I'll call it, earnings from additional capacities that we have. And we're continuing to make progress on those fronts as well.
Year in and year out, our goal is to not -- I'll call it in normal operations is to offset inflation. And also, as you think about going from '21 to '22, I would say on -- the variable comp will also be a tailwind as we manage all 3 of those buckets."

So I'm going to sort of answer the first part of that question, and then I'm going to hand it off to Willie for more of the detail. But first of all, I just want to sort of recognize, we really are proud of how well our teams have managed and delivered free cash flow and the stability in which we've been able to do it in both good and challenging times. Really, when we reflect on it, it's been a decade journey to get to this kind of performance.
When you go back to where we were before the Solutia transaction, our free cash flow, frankly, wasn't as strong. And Solutia dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio along with Taminco being less capital-intensive and improving our free cash flow. So in addition to earnings, there was a significant benefit that came out of the Solutia acquisition on the free cash flow side.
And then we've had just tremendous success in growing these high-value innovation products that are quite attractive margins, which means they generate a lot of cash, and improving the cash flow of the portfolio that way. And then, of course, there's recent actions we've taken in optimizing our portfolio like selling tires that's going to give us additional cash. So we're in a very strong sort of strategic position from a cash and balance sheet point of view.
And as we look at it going forward, just to reiterate our priorities, first and foremost is doing CapEx consistent with our specialty innovation growth strategy and making sure we have the capacity in place to support our growth. Then of course, there's this acceleration opportunity around the circular economy. The first step is just part of our strategy, which is how do we add recycled content to our specialty products. But as we've discussed on this call, there's this opportunity to build additional plants in this Airgas model that could substantially add to our EBITDA. And so we're going to be looking at those as an option for cash.
And then you get to share repurchases and bolt-on M&A as the next steps. Of course, we always have a growing dividend that is part of that overall cash story. So it's -- the priorities are clear there. To be clear, we're not looking at large M&A, if that question's out there. And we think that pulling all these levers in concert is a way to create a nice balanced growth story for the company.
I'll let Willie give you a little more details around exactly where the cash position sits at this point."

Our balance sheet is in great shape. We're below 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and expect to also from a rating agency view to achieve 2.5x or below by year-end. We're in a great position. And as we think about going forward, we have roughly $1.2 billion remaining on our current stock repurchase authorization.

It's been many years of how well this performance films business has done both in the window film and the paint protection film. It's been a tremendous growth story. Last year, they grew in a very downmarket because this category, paint protection film in particular, is just dramatically growing in how people want to protect their paint.
And we just launched a new Gen 3 product that is substantially better than our existing products, which were still market-leading in their performance, but it's much easier to install. It performs better in protecting the paint, and it now actually has the gloss of ceramic coating. If you're familiar with the car industry, so it actually has a better gloss when you put this on than the original clear coat of the car.
I just came back from visiting a bunch of dealers out West and getting their direct feedback about how this is going, and we're just incredibly excited about that. And it's not just the product. We've also rolled out a new software program called CORE that has superior pattern cutting, which is a really difficult part of doing paint protection film well when you think about all the different car shapes there and getting the film to fit properly around the car. And this software allows them to make very precise cuts and install much easier with the patterns of all the cars in the last 10 years, which is a nontrivial task to create, I might add.
So it's done really well. And then the channel strategies we've deployed about working with auto dealers in addition the retail market has expanded our market tremendously over the last 5 years. So it's a great business, it's growing well, high-value mix upgrade to the segment. And even with the auto market slowing down, we're seeing this business continue to do well because dealers are trying to focus on what they can upsell onto their car with limited volume they have to sell.

And look, we think we're making tremendous progress on changing our portfolio and our performance towards specialty. We've done the analysis, and I know all of you can go do it. But if you go look at how we've held up margins, over the '18 to now or '17 to now, as a total company how we've delivered earnings performance, we're much more in the specialty category than in the commodity category of our peer set. The data is actually quite clear. At some point, I'll show it to you.
So I think we've actually held up really well. There's no question that people sort of focus on the CI question right now. And the way I look at CI is it's an incredibly valuable part of our vertical integration and our reliability to our customers. We've proven the value to customers multiple times on how it supports that. And in times like this, where they get some expansion, while prices are catching up to raws and some other parts of the business, it actually gives us more stable earnings. That diversity actually creates economic stability. So I don't see what's wrong with that.
And as I look at '22, we certainly expect some moderation of CI in its spreads as we go into that year relative to this year. But when you look at all the growth that we have going for ourselves and improvements in the cost structure, we're actually quite confident we can deliver quite attractive earnings growth in '22 relative to '21, including the offset of the moderation in CI.
So when you got -- look at it from a market's point of view, a lot of markets that are still going to be in recovery mode next year, whether it's auto, building construction, medical, aviation, you've got restocking that will still continue into next year, I think. And then you've got really steady growth markets like care chemicals, ag water treatment consumables that about -- those sort of stable markets that are about 40% of our revenue.
On top of that, you've got all the innovation driving growth across the whole portfolio, whether it's performance films I just discussed; Tritan, we've hit on. We still got next-gen acoustics and HUD and interlayers growing. We've got Tetrashield and food and beverage packaging, textiles, entertain, et cetera. And then you got the circular economy driving more growth. And then we've got good smart segmentation strategies in the business we're in. So we're in the right parts of the markets like luxury cars and EVs, et cetera.
And it's not just volume. You've got to remember all these things that are growing really well are high-value mix. The challenges we had in '19 and '20 were not spread, right? It was -- as a company, we're in the specialties. It was just that high-value mix coming off, and it's now coming back. And we said, you'll see the mirror image benefit of that, and you're seeing it this year and you'll see it next year.
In addition to that, you got costs coming up by $100 million on the operational level, plus another $50 million in lower distribution and shutdown costs seem to sort of the onetime things. And then you've got where you think spreads might go and you've got increased growth spend. So when you put it all together, net, we're well positioned to deliver EPS growth in '22 relative to this year."

As we look at Advanced Materials, we actually expect very strong growth in Advanced Materials next year relative to this year. So that story is going to continue to be strong and be even more compelling next year. So that's really exciting.
When you look at AFP and look at the 2/3 of AFP, in other words, without tires and adhesives in it, the earnings this year are expected to be a bit better than 2018 levels when you look at that portfolio. And a lot of that is just tremendous growth in coatings in line with our customers in addition to good steady growth in things like ag and animal nutrition and care chemicals as well as fluids.
So a good story across the board, and that even includes the aviation headwind when I say that about this year being better than 2018 for the 2/3 of AFP. So -- and that's also positioned to keep growing both through recovering markets and innovation next year. Not quite as much as AM because they're still earlier in their innovation cycle, but still delivering nice growth. So those 2 grow well. Fibers being quite stable, an improving cost structure gives you a very solid position."

And we're really excited about the results we had in the second quarter. And to your point, really excited about the momentum we're building in our specialties as we go forward into the back half of the year, which will be the driving force for earnings in the back half.
When you think about it, we had strong volume and mix growth in the specialties, especially relative to last year or '19 or even '18, and the progress that we're making. And that momentum will continue into the back half of this year. Now some of that strength in volume and mix growth was offset by sort of temporarily high sort of distribution costs and some of the other supply chain factors that we faced in the second quarter and expect those to abate. So not only do you get the volume and mix growth, you get some improvement in spreads relative to the first half. So that's going to drive a nice improvement for specialties. 
And I would say that it's going to hold up better, I think, in the fourth quarter than what is normal seasonality as we look at the lack of restocking customers have made to date. And we don't think that they're going to make much progress on it really through this year, and that will extend into next year. So that's a big driver.
In addition to that, you've got lower shutdown costs. A lot of that hit AFP in particular. So you've got that as a benefit. You've got lower operating costs from all of our operational transformation work and, as I mentioned earlier, this distribution coming off the service spike that it was.
There are, of course, headwinds as we expect some moderation in spreads in Chemical Intermediates, and we have increasing gross spend. So there are some factors that offset some of that, but it's definitely much more of a specialty story and how you deliver a back half that's better than the first."

So we're really excited about how -- our circular economy investments are both solving a serious challenge in the planet, a dual challenge really, of getting plastic waste out of the environment and deploying a technology that a",685,"Yes. Mike, great question. So we're really excited about how -- our circular economy investments are both solving a serious challenge in the planet, a dual challenge really, of getting plastic waste out of the environment and deploying a technology that avoid using fossil fuels and does it in a way that has a lower carbon footprint than our current traditional process. So really a win on both fronts.
And our customers see that benefit, and it's important. Both elements are really important in the solution. And we've had tremendous engagement. As we talked about in the first quarter, you saw a spectrum of brands signing on to take our recycled content both from our polyester renewal technology as well as our carbon renewal technology into the biopolymers. And getting P&G and Ferragamo and a variety of other brands to sign on top is putting us in a great position to fill out this first facility that we're building that will come online.
Now we're already getting benefit from those because we have a bridging capacity in place with our current assets. So we're building volume and momentum this year and into next. That's part of our growth story. But with these commitments, we're going to be in a good position to sort of fill out that plant really quickly with specialty products, which is great. And that's the best way to build a plant is when it ramps up full, especially in specialty product line that's not normal and certainly improves the return.
And yes, there are interest in going beyond this. We have, of course, specialty strategy we're really excited about, and we're going to continue to invest in that. But beyond that, a lot of customers out there in the fast-moving consumer goods world still have to do a lot of packaging. And they realize that the best carbon footprint is plastic. It's important to keep that in mind when you think about solving these problems. Because in our world of polyester, glass has doubled the carbon footprint even with much higher recycling rates than polyester day, and aluminum's 50% higher. 
So we need to solve this problem. Our brands understand this problem needs to be solved by recycling polymer as the best carbon footprint solution as well as a way to get the waste out of the environment.
So we have a number of countries actually engage with us about how to help them think about solving their waste problem, and we have a number of brands engaged with us on how we would potentially build facilities for their packaging needs that really solves this dual challenge. And so we're engaged.
But to be clear, we're not going to get back into the sort of merchant PET business. We are happy to get back into making this product, but it's got to be in a more Airgas model. We bring a lot to the table in the technology that's proven and scalable. We have a lot of operational capability, a lot of ability to build and scale up facilities as well as operate them really well and a lot of history with methanolysis that allows us to know exactly how to operate this kind of technology, which is difficult when you've got a variable feed stream of content coming into it.
And for what we bring to the table, we want sort of spread stability. So we need to have long-term contracts with customers that give us a sort of predictable margin and as well feel certain we've got access to raw material supply, which is significant but still complicated to access.
So we meet these conditions, we'll for sure build these facilities. And we think that the return on capital and the amount of EBITDA each of these facilities could generate would be quite substantial. We're not going to get into the details of that now. But we're really excited about doing this, but it depends on the customers and the countries engaging in the right way. And hopefully, we'll be able to build several of these plants going forward."

I would also highlight the Solutia was a transformative acquisition that's created significant shareholder value and positioned us for growth through the innovation and the innovation-driven growth model that we have. And that's been highlighted in interlayers, performance films and specialty fluids, which are doing incredibly well right now. And we've highlighted that on many calls.
Also, over the past couple of years, we've highlighted the fact of the headwinds in the 1/3. Many of those being macro with trade, also the competition. So as we assess this business, as you know, the accounting rules don't let us reallocate the goodwill back to the purchase date. So overall, we've got a strong portfolio and have transformed, but we also need to move forward. And I think we've been decisive with those actions.
And yes, it's resulting in a $500 million write-off, but we believe we've contributed -- created a tremendous amount of value. And now we're wanting to focus on what Mark just spoke about, which is investing in the circular economy and growing the 2/3."

So when you think about polyester in the U.S., just around the first point we're building here, there's about 20 billion pounds of polyester waste annually produced in this country that goes into packaging, textiles and carpet. 40% -- only 40% of it is actually packaging. And when you look at what can be mechanically recycled of that 40%, only 25% to 30% can realistically be mechanically recycled. And the vast majority of that recycling is actually into textiles, not back into bottles because you have to have extremely clean polymer to clean up and melt back into a bottle. So it's very limited on how you can actually solve the packaging problem with mechanical recycling. And then all the carpet and textiles pretty much ends up in landfill because mechanical recycling, again, doesn't really have an ability to do something with it.
So under any of these scenarios, when you look at all this waste, and we want as much mechanical recycling to happen as possible because it has a good carbon footprint, it's going to be very limited. And it also doesn't have a long-term life because, through mechanical recycling, the polymer breaks down after sort of 5 cycles. So molecular recycling, which is what we're doing, is essential to really solving this problem. And again, it's essential because the alternative materials have a worse carbon footprint.
So we're really excited to be a leader in how to solve this. And the advantage of being a leader for our feedstock teams are out there engaging on multiple sources is we're way ahead of everyone else and going to commercial scale, right? We only -- in the polyester world, we only have other sort of small start-ups attempting to get into this space on the planet. And they don't have the resources that we have in technology, operations, how to build a skeletal plant, et cetera. So when we engage with the brands, we have a compelling story, not just of a solution but our ability to actually deliver it and be scalable in how we do it.
And when you're willing to assign value to a waste that's going to landfill versus landfill, customer -- suppliers engage quite actively. And so we're feeling very good about being able to access that. So we're not going to get into what the price is. We're keeping our strategy and details of how we're accessing feedstock confidential as a competitive advantage in our point of view, but we're very confident we can access waste at a very affordable level.
And then on the customer side, the customers recognize that recycled content is going to be at a premium. As we shared with you all the way back in January, the premium that rPET is getting relative to fossil fuel-based PET is substantial, 60% to 80% premium in Europe right now. And the premiums aren't that far behind as they're now starting to climb in the U.S. as well. So they know that this is going to cost additional money. And what we can provide is more certainty on the price and predictability than what you can get from the spot or PET market that's at the food-grade level. 
So that's also part of a value proposition in our Airgas models. While we want to make long -- while we have to have long-term commitments for our customers to make our economics work, it also is structured in a way that gives them a lot more price certainty in how to manage their business. So I think it works for both parties."

And yes, it's quite the recovery in Chemical Intermediates like many other companies who have similar kind of products versus last year. And it's a combination of better volume but significantly better spread that's driving that success in the portfolio.
But before I get to the spread part, I want to just get to the composition of CI first, as you asked. So about 25% of the revenue in CI is actually amines -- functional amines. They're mostly on cost pass-through contracts. And so they've had very steady spread since we've, frankly, bought Taminco in the way their business is structured. And they've had a nice solid steady volume growth over time, delivering very predictable and attractive earnings. And they've got a few accelerants on top of that beyond just the normal ag growth.
So we've got a plant that we just built and are ramping up for Corteva for their Enlist product that's giving us a lot more additional growth on top of that core business. So that's just been a nice, great steady business.
Then you do have plasticizers, which has been a very attractive business. We've been a leader in non-phthalate plasticizers for a long time. And so we get not just underlying market growth but above-market growth in that business as we've been replacing other plasticizers. And the spreads there, of course, connected to the olefin chain have done quite well this year. But it's not just spreads, it's also a nice growth story with the position we have in that marketplace.
And then you've got olefins and acetyls. Olefins and that set of intermediates that we make there is by far a bigger part of the business than acetyls. And spreads have obviously significantly improved with the dynamics in propylene relative to propane. So that's been a driver of the performance.
Acetyls is a much smaller business for us. And it's important to remember, we're not really in acetic acid very much. It's just a co-product. We make acetic anhydride. We're the largest player in acetic anhydride in the world to make cellulosics, right? So when we look at the value of that stream with all the specialties that are made off of that in Advanced Materials, AFP, and of course, Fibers, the margins are -- that integrated acetyl stream is quite significant and above company average.
So it's really about the olefins part where we're having some benefits, obviously, right now as well as -- at some point, we'll expect moderation. But even there, we've made investments to improve CI and stability. So we have a lot of that business on cost pass-through contracts versus spot because we want a predictable earnings that really showed a lot of benefit in how well CI held up on an annual basis in '19 and '20 relative to '18. So we did quite a bit better than others on that front. And of course, we're getting a benefit this year, not quite the same spot prices as some others might have. And we're happy to make that trade-off. 
But we've done other things like the RGP investment, which has been a phenomenal investment to give us the ability to reduce the amount of ethylene we produce when it's not attractive and still make it when it is. So that's been a great way to stabilize that business.
And we've optimized sites like taking Singapore down, which has been one of the highest parts of olefin volatility in our portfolio. And shutting that down will improve not just earnings, but reduce volatility. 
So a lot of things going on across the board to optimize value here. And it's important to keep in mind, Chemical Intermediates exists to support the specialties, which are growing really well. And part of the reason you'll see volume going down this business is because the specialties are consuming it so fast in their growth. So overall, it's playing its role, creating the value of reliability for customers, creating value to optimize our cost structure. And we're really proud of the team in how they've optimized value here in the first half of the year."

So part of our commentary is that -- propane was about $0.90 on average in the second quarter. It's $1.10 in July. So you've got some propane headwind. The prices are holding up well.
Now our guidance includes some expectation that prices will start to normalize as we go through the back half of this year. I think there's a wide range of opinions about the rate at which prices may or may not normalize in the back half of the year. I'd say we're probably in the middle of the road on -- relative to the commentary out there, where we expect some but not dramatic. And we said we're getting out of the olefin forecasting business a long time ago, and we're going to stick with that. It's a little hard to predict the pace at which these markets can change.
But appreciate the earnings. It's actually been a nice balance as we're working pricing relative to raws and the specialties. And so these sort of neutralize each other out in some ways. And on the spread front, our strategy is focused on growing high-value volume and mix through innovation in the specialties, which is the vast majority of who we are. It's nice to get these benefits out of CI, but it's also nice that it's a small part of the company and not a big driver of our long-term growth story."

So on the specialty side, I'd say our view is demand is going to be strong and hold up well in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter, so not that normal seasonal drop as we don't see a lot of progress in customers making sort of improvements in their inventory situation, especially in some markets like automotive or construction. And those kind of markets clearly are being sort of rate limited by supply chain challenges in the way they're serving underlying market demand, which is very strong around the world.
And so they're going to continue to want to sort of ramp up production whenever they get raw materials to serve that need. So we think that continues -- that sort of strength continues in the back half of this year, and frankly, into next year in those kind of end markets.
And then you got other steady markets that are just constantly growing like care chemicals, water treatment, ag, et cetera, that will -- that always provides stability. So we think it's going to hold up better on that side. When it comes to Chemical Intermediates, I think I already hit that, which is at some point, we expect normalization of spreads.

And the other half now is going to have recycled content in it through our recycling technology. And it's -- as a microfiber, it's certified as biodegradable. So it's a hat trick of solving the environmental problems that are out there. 
And we see really strong engagement from customers on that. It's a nice high-margin product for us and a way to sort of repurpose all of the fiber's capacity that was making tow. So we're spending a lot of time driving that, and it's just a great success story.
And when you think about just this year, the amount of growth we're having in textiles is offsetting the decline in tow and the onetime hit we took in that discontinued specialty product, which was $10 million alone. So really great progress by that team.
And yes, there is the opportunity in addition to that to look at polyester fiber with recycled content in it.

To your point, we've delivered greater free cash flow this year, almost $450 million in the first 6 months. And that's facing raw material pricing inflation of about $200 million higher than last year.
As Mark highlighted earlier, the supply chains continue, I'll call it, to be, I'll call it thin. And we're looking to ensure security of supply. So there would be choices that we would make to ensure in our specialties that we have the ability to meet our demands of our customers, and we would make those trade-offs.

So I think we're doing well on managing prices in the specialties. As we look through the second quarter and the way we're increasing prices here in the third quarter, we think we're well on track to managing prices relative to raw material costs and really incredibly proud of the teams in how they're doing that.
The challenge we had in the second quarter was the spike in distribution costs on top of the raw materials. A lot of it was just airfreighting, right? So it's not just price per unit delivered, but it's a mode that we had to use to keep our customers supplied. So there just was a tremendous amount of airfreighting going on. We expect that to abate back to more normal modes and as well as sort of calm down a bit.
Now we're getting some price to cover some of those costs, but not all of it, and that's part of the offset that you saw in the second quarter. So as we go into the back half, we feel really quite good about keeping up with raws and managing the distribution total cost. So that's not really our concern. We're focused on just trying to get volume and mix delivered to customers.
And the market demand out there is really good, well above our logistics capabilities that we can access. And so the constraint is going to be more about just access to logistics on how we drive demand in the back half of the year and how much that could limit the level of growth in the back half relative to the second quarter.

But first of all, I just want to sort of recognize, we really are proud of how well our teams have managed and delivered free cash flow and the stability in which we've been able to do it in both good and challenging times. Really, when we reflect on it, it's been a decade journey to get to this kind of performance.
When you go back to where we were before the Solutia transaction, our free cash flow, frankly, wasn't as strong. And Solutia dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio along with Taminco being less capital-intensive and improving our free cash flow. So in addition to earnings, there was a significant benefit that came out of the Solutia acquisition on the free cash flow side.
And then we've had just tremendous success in growing these high-value innovation products that are quite attractive margins, which means they generate a lot of cash and improving the cash flow of the portfolio that way. And then, of course, there's recent actions we've taken in optimizing our portfolio like selling tires. That's going to give us additional cash. So we're in a very strong sort of strategic position from a cash and balance sheet point of view.
And as we look at it going forward, just to reiterate our priorities, first and foremost, is doing CapEx consistent with our specialty innovation growth strategy and making sure we have the capacity in place to support our growth. Then of course, there's this acceleration opportunity around the circular economy. The first step is just part of our strategy, which is how do we add recycled content to our specialty products. But as we've discussed on this call, there's this opportunity to build additional plants in this Airgas model that could substantially add to our EBITDA. And so we're going to be looking at those as an option for cash.
And then you get to share repurchases and bolt-on M&A as the next steps. Of course, we always have a growing dividend that is part of that overall cash story. So it's -- the priorities are clear there. To be clear, we're not looking at large M&A, if that question's out there. And we think that pulling all these levers in concert is a way to create a nice balanced growth story for the company.

And then repurpose those PET assets to making our traditional copolyesters and then repurchasing those polymer assets to make Tritan.
And we did a bunch of expansions in 2018 to support growth across the entire company portfolio and are doing a number of them here that we started last year, expecting recovery on the back end of COVID and the need for growth assets. Tritan's one of those many projects that we have going on, where we've converted a copolyester line in the second quarter of this year to Tritan and will come online this quarter.
And that's a continuous story, in addition to probably -- we're getting to a point where we're probably going to add polymer capacity because the growth across the portfolio, not just Tritan, has been so robust. But I think that, that really has been a big driver of the story. Greg wants to talk. So Greg, go ahead."

So they buy a lot of recycled content today from those companies. And working with them and encouraging them to broaden what they do beyond just easy-to-recycle product and making this broader waste stream available to us is a point of collaboration for us.
So there's collaboration with the existing infrastructure and encouragement for them to improve their capabilities. There's also collaboration at the political level, both national and state level and even local level on policy that supports the improvement in recycling infrastructure, encourages the consumers to have the right behavior. There's a lot of different ways to get at that with what's called EPRs, expand and produce responsibility, or bottle bills, et cetera, that can drive more recycling and ensuring that the value of recycling material versus putting at landfill has more value. And policy comes in play there, too.
So there's a lot to be done at multiple levels. And I think P&G, and frankly, a number of other brands that we're talking to are going to be really valuable partners in advocating to help improve our ability to sort of be responsible with this valuable resource and create a true circular economy."

And it's not been a couple of quarters, it's been many years of how well this performance films business has done both in the window film and the paint protection film. It's been a tremendous growth story. Last year, they grew in a very downmarket because this category of paint protection film in particular, is just dramatically growing in how people want to protect their paint.
And we just launched a new Gen 3 product that is substantially better than our existing products, which were still market-leading in their performance, but it's much easier to install. It performs better in protecting the paint, and it now actually has the gloss of ceramic coating, if you're familiar with the car industry. So it actually has a better gloss when you put this on than the original clear coat of the car.
I just came back from visiting a bunch of dealers out West and getting their direct feedback about how this is going, and we're just incredibly excited about that. And it's not just the product. We've also rolled out a new software program called Core that has superior pattern cutting, which is a really difficult part of doing paint protection film well when you think about all the different car shapes there and getting the film to fit properly around the car. And this software allows them to make very precise cuts and install much easier with the patterns of all the cars in the last 10 years, which is a nontrivial task to create, I might add.
So it's done really well. And then the channel strategies we've deployed about working with auto dealers, in addition, in the retail market has expanded our market tremendously over the last 5 years. So it's a great business, it's growing well, high-value mix upgrade to the segment. And even with the auto market slowing down, we're seeing this business continue to do well because dealers are trying to focus on what they can upsell onto the car with the limited volume they have to sell. So we're getting good engagement as we're trying to add features to what they're selling."

Obviously, the CI earnings are maybe making that a little more challenging for people to embrace. And we've seen some pretty good devaluation in your stock over the last few months, almost akin to you being lumped in with some of the peak fears that are out there on some other maybe more commoditized names. 
So I guess, how do you see CI -- I mean is it going to fade and create a big step-down that sort of robs from the aggregate growth? As the specialty businesses grow, do you think it can stabilize? And I was just looking at consensus numbers, and it looks like something like 2% EBITDA growth in '22 and '23. Can you give us some inspiration that, that is inadequate?"

And look, we think we're making tremendous progress on changing our portfolio and our performance towards specialty. We've done the analysis. And I know all of you can go do it. But if you go look at how we've held up",582,"Yes. So Bob, thanks for the question. And look, we think we're making tremendous progress on changing our portfolio and our performance towards specialty. We've done the analysis. And I know all of you can go do it. But if you go look at how we've held up margins over the '18 to now or '17 to now as a total company, how we've delivered earnings performance, we're much more in the specialty category than in the commodity category of our peer set. The data is actually quite clear. At some point, I'll show it to you.
So I think we've actually held up really well. There's no question that people sort of focus on the CI question right now. And the way I look at CI is it's an incredibly valuable part of our vertical integration and our reliability to our customers. We've proven the value to customers multiple times on how it supports that. 
And in times like this, where they get some expansion, while prices are catching up to raws and some other parts of the business, it actually gives us more stable earnings. That diversity actually creates economic stability. So I don't see what's wrong with that.
And as I look at '22, we certainly expect some moderation of CI in its spreads as we go into that year relative to this year. But when you look at all the growth that we have going for ourselves and improvements in the cost structure, we're actually quite confident we can deliver quite attractive earnings growth in '22 relative to '21, including the offset of the moderation in CI.
So when you got -- look at it from a market's point of view, a lot of markets that are still going to be in recovery mode next year, whether it's auto, building construction, medical, aviation, you've got restocking that will still continue into next year, I think. And then you've got really steady growth markets like care chemicals, ag, water treatment, consumables that are about -- those sort of stable markets that are about 40% of our revenue.
On top of that, you've got all the innovation driving growth across the whole portfolio, whether it's performance films I just discussed; Tritan, we've hit on. We still got next-gen acoustics and HUD and interlayers growing. We've got Tetrashield and food and beverage packaging, textiles, et cetera. And then you got the circular economy driving more growth. And then we've got good, smart segmentation strategies in the business we're in. So we're in the right parts of the markets like luxury cars and EVs, et cetera.
And it's not just volume. You've got to remember all these things that are growing really well are high-value mix. The challenges we had in '19 and '20 were not spread, right? It was -- as a company, we're in the specialties. It was just that high-value mix coming off, and it's now coming back. And we said, you'll see the mirror image benefit of that, and you're seeing it this year and you'll see it next year.
In addition to that, you got costs coming up by $100 million on the operational level, plus another $50 million in lower distribution and shutdown costs, sort of the onetime things. And then you've got where you think spreads might go and you've got increased growth spend. So when you put it all together, net, we're well positioned to deliver EPS growth in '22 relative to this year."

So thinking about that growth rate of 8% to 12%, I think, is a reasonable way to think about next year at the EPS level.

So that story is going to continue to be strong and be even more compelling next year. So that's really exciting.
When you look at AFP and look at the 2/3 of AFP, in other words, without tires and adhesives in it, the earnings this year are expected to be a bit better than 2018 levels when you look at that portfolio. And a lot of that is just tremendous growth in coatings in line with our customers in addition to good steady growth in things like ag and animal nutrition and care chemicals as well as fluids.
So a good story across the board, and that even includes the aviation headwind when I say that about this year being better than 2018 for the 2/3 of AFP. So -- and that's also positioned to keep growing both through recovering markets and innovation next year. Not quite as much as AM because they're still earlier in their innovation cycle, but still delivering nice growth. So those 2 grow well.

When you think about the overall segments, obviously, when you start with the specialty businesses, as we've noted here, there's just tremendous growth that we see possible on a number of factors, right? We've got volum",697,"Sure. So -- and here for me, David. When you think about the overall segments, obviously, when you start with the specialty businesses, as we've noted here, there's just tremendous growth that we see possible on a number of factors, right? We've got volume and mix that should be a significant driver with the economy, to some degree, growing with the markets in it. And there's also a lot of pent-up demand out there to drive added additional growth versus GDP as consumers fulfill desires that they can't get due to supply chain constraints and we're restocking inventory, which has not at all happened yet in this year. So that's quite positive. 
And when you think about that, especially the pent-up demand part, I think that's more significant in the AM segment. So we've given you a breakdown of AM being about 70% of that variable margin improvement versus AFP. The innovation is also incredibly strong, especially in AM, where we're going to continue to outperform the underlying markets in a significant way. You've seen this in this year. You saw it last year in AM. You've seen it for the last decade. [ Recur ] offerings are also accelerating a lot of growth for us in the SP business. You've seen $600 million in new business revenue from innovation. So that's a good momentum that we take into next year. 
So again, those are a bit more biased towards the AM as AFP businesses also getting traction. And then market segment strategies. We continue to sort of focus on the markets that are growing, whether it's luxury EVs, water treatment, care chemicals, where we pick up a lot of just natural market growth. 
And importantly, keep in mind, a lot of the growth I just described, all of its high-value mix, both within the segment and certainly at the corporate level. So there's a lot of leverage to have AM have a significant increase in earnings next year when you think about those elements. And that's also true for AFP to have good solid growth. 
And then on the spread side, it's the same thing. You've got really headwinds obviously this year and prices catching up to raws through the year. And there will be -- with the price actions we're taking through the fourth quarter and a lot of effective price increases on January 1 in businesses, you're going to see a pretty big step-up in earnings there from spreads getting better as long as you believe raw materials are going to plateau relative to the back half of this year and then trend off in the back half of next year, which is sort of our underlying assumption. 
So then you pick up a pretty significant spread tailwind. It's the same thing. AFP has done a better job of sort of keeping track with prices this year because they have a lot more cost pass-through contracts. Half of the price increase in the third quarter was CPTs and AFP. Whereas AM, the interlayers business, in particular, has a lot of annual price contracts. So it takes a while to get those prices moving up. So again, that sort of supports that 70-30 split on the spread side, too. 
So those businesses are both going to deliver considerable growth in earnings in AM as well as when you look at AFP on a recasted basis, minus the divestitures. So that's a lot of the growth there. Fibers, I think, will also be renegotiating, putting prices in on probably more than half of their revenue come January 1. And so earnings will improve there. 
And then, of course, in CI, you've got normalization. That's going to happen in that business, but it's going to be offset by volume growth that will be pretty substantial next year relative to this year in ag, plasticizers and some other growth opportunities that we have as well as less shutdown. 
So that all helps out. And of course, there's the cost tailwinds that we've given to you that's spread across all of these segments that give them sort of added growth. So that's sort of how it balances out, David."

We think that AM, AFP businesses are very well positioned to deliver strong growth and earnings and increasingly improving margins. And the Fibers and the olefins part or the CI part of the business is an integral part of our integration, scale, cash flow, et cetera. So we like the portfolio as it's configured right now as we look at deploying capital to your question, Kevin, on delivering more growth from the total company. 
When it comes to capital deployment, obviously, our free cash flow remains incredibly strong. And our balance sheet now is also strong, with delevering being in our rearview mirror. So as we look forward, I think we should think about how we deploy capital on sort of multiple fronts. 
First, you should expect CapEx to increase a bit next year as we have the combination of specialty growth and the first methanolysis plant that we're building here in Kingsport. So normal CapEx growth to support our specialty strategy is in that $500 million to $600 million range. And then, of course, you've got a good portion of that $250 million of the Kingsport plant being spent next year. 
Now we're balancing some of the specialty CapEx between next year and pushing some of it to '23 to keep this sort of imbalance across the 2 years, but CapEx will be a bit higher for that. 
Then after that, you look at how am I going to deploy the balance sheet and cash, and there's really sort of four buckets. The first is the potential to continue investing in the circular economy. We're pursuing multiple projects beyond this first plant. If we can achieve the conditions that we've talked about in the past about those being very attractive investments and very stable sources of earnings, those projects could be very accretive to earnings and ROIC. They're very attractive from a return point of view. And that could be a use of where we go with our balance sheet. 
The second, of course, is bolt-on M&A where we'd like to ramp up that level from where we've been in the last couple of years. This is returning cash to shareholders, which I think will be significant as we move forward. And, of course, a growing dividend. 
So it will be a balance of capital deployment, I think, like we've always had across these areas. There's a lot of attractive investment opportunities for us right now. And so we're really excited about how we can sort of deploy capital and create growth for our shareholders."

That's another one of the differences, AFPs. Their automotive exposure is about half refinish and half OEMs. So they're a lot more balanced in the OEM production drama as refinished is just continuing to improve. 
But on the OEM side, the supply chain is really short between OEM production and the production of our interlayers. So that actually happens pretty quickly. So as they're adjusting their production rates weekly, we're adjusting right there with them. So we're realizing that in a pretty quick fashion. 
The performance films business has actually done really well through the third quarter because companies -- the dealers -- the auto dealers are out there trying to upgrade the value they were getting on each car. And so selling our paint protection films, window films was a nice adder to the few cars that they have to sell. But even that, seem start to catch up to us on what they have to sell right now. 
So we're feeling a bit of that as we go into the third -- the fourth quarter. 
But I think that as they have more cars to sell or produce more cars, you're going to see that pickup in sales happen pretty quickly for us because there's really no inventory in the channel between us and the primary market. So that, I think, is good news, as supply chains at some point are going to start getting back in control and production will be there. 
Clearly, end market demand is quite strong. So there's plenty of pent-up demand of people who want to buy cars. When you look at just how much they're paying for used cars right now, they're clearly -- there's a lot of demand out there. So I think if we have a recovery, it will be pretty fast.

The two obvious questions that come up in the past is Fibers and olefins. On the Fibers front, I remind everyone that it is deeply integrated into our overall cellulosic biopolymer business. We have a lot of biopolymers, especially as we're selling off of the stream in Advanced Materials and AFP. And with the significant change in the world's view around waste plastic and climate, we just have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us in both AM and AFP, with that integrated stream. 
You're going to learn a lot more about that at Innovation Day where we're going to identify a bunch of new opportunities we're pursuing that can be quite substantial. And textiles growth in itself, and Fibers, has been actually quite strong. It's incredible how the textile growth had been 80% up year-over-year, obviously, on the challenged market that still tremendous growth, offsetting not just -- market decline, but also that discontinued product. 
So that business as well is at the position now where textile growth will offset to market decline or better. And where, in fact, demand exceeding our expectations, where we're having to pull forward conversion of tow assets to making textiles. So that business is on track and it generates a huge amount of cash flow that supports all the investments we're making in growth in AM and AFP. 
Olefins, it's a bit of a similar story where we're dramatically improving the quality of the earnings in that business. Obviously, it's doing really well. But we've been taking a lot of actions over the last 3 years to improve what is a new normal for this business, which is more likely probably around $300 million. 
And there are things like closing the Singapore plant where we had a very disadvantaged raw material energy position. That's a big upgrade in the quality of that business with it closed. A lot of operational cost transformation work that we're doing across the company does flow into the big assets that flow into Chemical Intermediates. The RGP investment is giving us flexibility to reduce ethylene when it's not attractive and make it when it is that. It reduces sort of volatility around that. And we've got a new investment, we'll tell you about an Innovation Day for modest capital that will significantly improve our olefin production flexibility. 
And mix is getting better, right? The [ amines ] business inside that overall portfolio is great, growing and stable. And we have a lot of our businesses on cost pass-through contracts that give us a certain amount of stability, probably about 40% of ROCE. 
There's a lot of things in the olefins space we've done to improve it. We're obviously disciplined about our portfolio. But as you look at the significant growth opportunities we have in front of us and that balance sheet strength that we want to leverage, deploy and grow the company, the cash from both Fibers and olefins creates a lot of value. So when we look at the portfolio today for what we want to do now, this is the right portfolio to grow."

There's just a tremendous amount of opportunities when you've got a polymer that's 60% biopolymer with our new recycling technology there, 40% recycled plastic waste. And the biodegradability of the product is tunable for different applications. And that last part about biodegradability is increasingly important, and we'll tell you more about that in Innovation Day and some of the opportunities in front of us. 
So we see a lot of growth in capital deployment in that direction to deliver a lot of organic growth from the portfolio we have right now, where we don't really feel the pressure to run out and do some large M&A. And at the prices today for large M&A that's really attractive, you're going to have a challenged situation in getting a good return. So we don't really -- we're not really focusing on that."

The advantage we have right now is we're pretty much ahead of the industry and going to commercial scale and building the largest molecular recycling plant on the planet, I think, at this point. So that gives us an advantage in how we show up with different suppliers for what we need. 
There's no doubt that there's plenty of plastic waste. I mean, when you look at polyester just in the U.S., you've got over 20 million pounds of waste a year. About 40% of that is packaging and only about 25% to 30% of that can be recycled today. So -- and when it gets recycled, frankly, most of it goes into textiles, not bottle to bottle. 
So as you tap into that stream and the advantage of methanolysis is it can use what can't be mechanical recycled from packaging, but it can also use carpet textiles, which almost all end up in landfill. So accessing 100,000 tons of feedstock out of that significantly large number when you're the first showing up to sort of secure it is challenging but doable. 
And the infrastructure out there clearly needs to improve in the U.S. as we get consumers to recycle more and policy to support it and infrastructure in place to sort of recycle it as we look at plants 2, 3 and 4. 
But as we look at the first one, we're confident that we can do this, and we will provide more detail in Innovation Day. You're going to hear that a lot today about -- you'll get more detailed innovation day, but it's a better forum to provide more detail on this question, which is incredibly important, and we're very focused on it."

So when you think about it in the specialty plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in Tritan.

So when you think about it in the specialty plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in Tritan. Market demand exceeding our logistics capability serving the market, and we're even capacity constrained into the second quarter, which is why we converted line over to serve Tritan. And now we've got that capacity coming in -- came online through the third quarter and a position to serve growth next year. 
And it's coming from a range of markets. So there's the traditional markets that are being driven with accelerated growth with our renewed recycled content like hydration that's delivering a lot of growth in housewares, those traditional markets that we've always grown in are being accelerated. 
And then on top of that, we're getting access to new markets that we wouldn't have normally had. The story we shared with you with Stanley Black & Decker a great example. I mean, it's a power tool. We're not normally in power tools. We normally go into optical clarity kind of applications with Tritan but this is the housings for power tools. And that customer adopted us because one, they're committed to addressing their Scope 3 climate from suppliers and recycled content was a way to start making progress on that, especially as our technology has a lower carbon footprint in a meaningful way relative to a normal fossil fuel process. 
And they wanted to maintain their quality, right? So a lot of these applications you can't use mechanical recycling at all because when you're just blending mechanical recycling with virgin, the quality of the product goes down on multiple dimensions. And you can't have that kind of a compromise in the power tool. So we were able to provide recycled content, carbon footprint improvement, zero compromise on the performance of the product. And that's an incredibly important aspect of why we're growing. 
And then the third part of it was actually a partnership for them. So they want to make sure they're aligned with a company that could scale with them and it was going to be a reliable supplier of this product. There's a lot of companies starting up out there, but they're start-ups, right? And they haven't scaled their technology. 
So when we can show up and provide a product where we've been -- have a 40-year history in doing methanolysis and we've got 100 years of history of supplying products to people very reliably, that was incredibly important to them and who they're going to choose. And we've had 10 other -- sign up in this quarter -- in the third quarter for those sort of similar set of reasons, which we'll tell you more about. 
But we're really well positioned. It's not just Tritan. It's crystal renew, which is our high clarity copolyester recycled content and cosmetic packaging. It's a wide spectrum of things, including our cellulosic into eyewear, et cetera. So a lot of growth in SP. 
Obviously, the interlayers in performance films businesses are tied to the auto production recovery as we discussed. But mix is still important, and we still see the mix improving faster than the absolute volume in production because the first thing that the OEMs are going to produce are more luxury high-end value cars when they start addressing their chip and component shortages. And we'll pick up that volume with our products are aligned with that market and the mix value of that is also incredibly important. So a lot of growth that can occur across the entire segment."

So add to them ramping up just to build inventory to serve the seasonal demand next year is good as the supply chain issues continue to get resolved on a availability point of view. So I think we'll continue to see very strong growth there. 
The care chemicals business has great steady growth, same with water treatment that will continue going into next year. And then almatricion is really accelerating their growth in higher-value formulated solutions through the 3F acquisition. And there's, of course, recovery in the aviation business. So there's a lot of different vectors across the entire segment that remains that's well positioned for growth in the markets that it serves.

As. demand gets a little bit more sort of balanced, those spot sales go away, and that's a bit of that headwind you're going to see from 3Q to 4Q for CI. 
But the overall fundamental dynamics of these markets at the derivative level, in particular, I think we expect to remain reasonably tight as we go into the first half of next year and then assume normalization towards that $300 million level in long term. So -- and I already went through all the details of how we've raised that, what is normal up in the actions that we've taken. I won't repeat it.

As you think about offsetting dilution and paying taxes, that will raise the number up to roughly $1.5 billion or so. We're going to put that money to work starting here in Q4 with the tires closing, which we expect here in the near term. 
With that, also given our balance sheet on the tires position, we don't expect to pay down any debt related to that.

And that is based on -- when you look at it relative to '21, an improvement in volume and mix that's been meaningful. 
Spreads are probably a bit challenged relative to '18 just as pricing is still catching up to raws. But overall, very well-positioned segment to deliver pretty strong earnings growth next year relative to that recast number. 
And that volume mix comes from everywhere. It's coatings, it's animal nutrition, it's care chemicals water treatment, even specialty fluids except for aviation in '21.

The important part of our strategy and our story is not spread, right? We've been very clear about this, right? Our strategy is growing volume and high-value mix in that volume against an asset base that we continue to upgrade with that mix to deliver increasing ROIC as well as deploying more capital for that high-value mix.

So there's a huge amount of upside as you're pointing out, and where I think our stock price can go from today. And as that all plays out, and our balance sheet strength that is quite significant now going forward gets deployed, there's a huge amount of upside. And we're confident investors are going to see that value and and invest in the company. And that's why we're doing our Innovation Day in December is to say, lay that all out for you to make sure all of you can see sort of how that can create compounded growth in earnings and cash flow as we go forward."

It's been a traditional structure in this market since we bought it with these annual contracts. We are looking at how we negotiate both price and structure to these contracts going forward. 
Obviously, in years of declining raw materials, we like them. In years where raw materials spike up, especially when they spike up like this, it's a problem. It's the same issue in Fibers, where you've got these annual or multi-annual contracts where the prices are locked in. And so when you had that huge spike up in energy and raw materials in the back half of this year, you're going to sort of have to wait until January to sort of recover it. But we are aggressively going out with price increases in both interlayers and Fibers, Jan 1."

We were thinking we have swing assets where we can make our specialty plastics or PET for packaging. And we thought we'd actually be selling a lot of PET for packaging, and that's looking like that's not going to be the case because the specialty demand is so strong. 
So I think we're in very good position for loading the asset pretty quickly into the markets. We're not going to disclose the specific percent number. But I think it's going to be quite robust and quick. 
As regards to demand that goes beyond our first plant, yes, the demand is very much there. And that's why we're working so diligently right now with countries and brands around the world, especially in U.S. and Europe right now who want to solve those challenges. 
When the brands look at this situation, right? They've got two goals. They got to address packaging waste, specifically plastic waste is getting a lot of attention. But if you switch to plastics on the [ else ], you still got to manage that waste. 
And so as you look at this, they've committed to very high recycled content targets, and there isn't remotely enough mechanical recycling product out there to supply that need reliably. In addition, the price of mechanical recycled rPET is going up dramatically in Europe and now as well in the U.S. And the brands are worried about how much that's going to keep going up. 
And they are also doing life cycle analysis on the carbon footprint of not just plastic, but alternative materials that they could consider. And unfortunately, you run into a problem, which is all the alternative materials have a worse climate footprint. You recently saw Wendy's switched from coated paper cups to plastic because plastics got a much better climate footprint and can be recycled where the coated paper cannot be recycled. 
So the brands are very focused on how to recycle plastic for a lot of applications and realizing that molecular recycling is the only way forward, especially long term, if you want to keep your product quality the same, then mechanical recycle is limited in how it can be used. And it degrades over time. So if you want an infinite solution, you've got to have molecular recycling as part of the solution. 
So engagement is strong. The need to build more plants is there. And we're driving to find a way to do that under the right conditions. And they are attracted to us because our scale -- our technology is scalable now where the start-ups are still sort of piloting and trying to figure out how to scale up. So that's also drawing a lot of attention to us. 
So we feel good about where we're at. We're excited about doing this. But to be clear, we're not going to build any additional plants unless we get the sort of contractual commitments for offtake to give us stable earnings."

Well, first of all, they're actually a great complement of technologies together at this site because we have a unique proprietary way to separate unsorted waste plastic that just separate it from polyester to everything else at a much lower cost. So that's one of the feedstock sourcing advantage that we have that I should have mentioned earlier. 
And that allows us to take that mixed waste plastic in the CRT, take it into our acetyl stream and make cellulosic biopolymers that gives us a lot of sourcing flexibility. So we see both technologies creating a lot of value, and the CRT is also, through the cellulosic, drawing a lot of attention. 
We've always had -- we've had a biopolymer for 100 years, if you want to go back to acetate film with Kodak. And we've created this huge spectrum of applications off of that core technology in AM, AFP and Fibers. 
But with the recent change in focusing on climate, focusing on plastic waste, instead of recycling, you can also have biodegradable products as a way to sort of have circular life and that's drawing a lot of attention around the cellulose. We can take back polymer and put it back in the CRT or we can also provide ones that biodegrade based on the application. So a lot of interesting growth there as well that we're really excited about."

I think what I'd say is we're sharing our best thinking with you right now of what we know. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty in the future. 
Things we're certain about is we know we can control our costs, right? And we have a very aggressive transformation program going that when you look at operational transformation cost cutting plus variable comp tailwind, that's about $200 million of tailwind that offsets about $80 million to $100 million of inflation. 
We know that we're going to invest in growing this business. We have tremendous growth opportunities right there across our portfolio. And so we have growth investments in that sort of $50 million to $75 million range that is controllable. We can control the pace of that based on the market is doing. And that does include some preproduction expense on starting up methanol and some other plants when you think about that number. 
But those are controllable. Obviously, there's uncertainty about where CI is going to go. I think we've got a reasonable assumption, but we'll see. We'll defer to the -- to some other companies on that and where the markets are. 
And then on the specialty side, what I'd say is we do feel good about the growth potential, the innovation to create levered growth on these markets and that spreads will be a tailwind. But there's still a lot of uncertainty about automotive demand as many of these questions have highlighted, there's uncertainty about where raw materials are going to trend and how they progress from where we are now into next year as well as distribution costs. So there's a lot of uncertainties out there that none of us can, frankly, predict. 
So what we're confident is if you look at it in three buckets, you've got divested earnings offset by share repurchases. You got a bucket of CI spread normalization offset by cost reductions. And then you're asking a question, which is can specialties grow next year relative to this year in variable margin.

We've got volume and mix that should be a significant driver with the economy, to some degree, growing with the markets in it. 
And there's also a lot of pent-up demand out there to drive added additional growth versus GDP as consumers fulfill desires that they can't get due to supply chain constraints and we're restocking inventory, which has not at all happened yet in this year. So that's all quite positive. 
And when you think about that, especially the pent-up demand part, I think that's more significant in the AM segment. So we've given you a breakdown of AM being about 70% of that variable margin improvement versus AFP. The innovation is also incredibly strong, especially in AM, where we're going to continue to outperform the underlying markets in a significant way. You've seen this in this year. 
You saw it last year in AM. You've seen it for the last decade. [ Recur ] offerings are also accelerating a lot of growth for us in the SP business. You've seen $600 million in new business revenue from innovation. So that's a good momentum that we take into next year.

We continue to sort of focus on the markets that are growing, whether it's luxury EVs, water treatment, care chemicals, where we pick up a lot of just natural market growth. 
And importantly, keep in mind, a lot of the growth I just described, all of its high-value mix, both within the segment and certainly at the corporate level. So there's a lot of leverage to have AM have a significant increase in earnings next year when you think about those elements. And that's also true for AFP to have good solid growth. 
And then on the spread side, it's the same thing. You've got really headwinds obviously this year and prices catching up to raws through the year. 
And there will be -- with the price actions we're taking through the fourth quarter and a lot of effective price increases on January 1 in businesses, you're going to see a pretty big step-up in earnings there from spreads getting better as long as you believe raw materials are going to plateau relative to the back half of this year and then trend off in the back half of next year, which is sort of our underlying assumption. 
So then you pick up a pretty significant spread tailwind. It's the same thing. AFP has done a better job of sort of keeping track with prices this year because they have a lot more cost pass-through contracts. Half of the price increase in the third quarter was CPTs and AFP. Whereas AM, the interlayers business, in particular, has a lot of annual price contracts. 
So it takes a while to get those prices moving up. So again, that sort of supports that 70-30 split on the spread side, too. 
So those businesses are both going to deliver considerable growth in earnings in AM as well as when you look at AFP on a recasted basis, minus the divestitures. So that's a lot of the growth there. Fibers, I think, will also be renegotiating, putting prices in on probably more than half of their revenue come January 1. And so earnings will improve there. 
And then, of course, in CI, you've got normalization. That's going to happen in that business, but it's going to be offset by volume growth that will be pretty substantial next year relative to this year in ag, plasticizers and some other growth opportunities that we have as well as less shutdown. 
So that all helps out. And of course, there's the cost tailwinds that we've given to you that's spread across all of these segments that give them sort of added growth. So that's sort of how it balances out, David."

So we certainly like the portfolio we now have. We think that AM, AFP businesses are very well-positioned to deliver strong growth and earnings and increasingly improving margins. And the Fibers and the olefins part or the CI part of the business is",435,"Yes. So we certainly like the portfolio we now have. We think that AM, AFP businesses are very well-positioned to deliver strong growth and earnings and increasingly improving margins. And the Fibers and the olefins part or the CI part of the business is an integral part of our integration, scale, cash flow, et cetera. 
So we like the portfolio as it's configured right now as we look at deploying capital to your question, Kevin, on delivering more growth from the total company. 
When it comes to capital deployment, obviously, our free cash flow remains incredibly strong. And our balance sheet now is also strong, with delevering being in our rearview mirror. So as we look forward, I think we should think about how we deploy capital on sort of multiple fronts. 
First, you should expect CapEx to increase a bit next year as we have the combination of specialty growth and the first methanolysis plant that we're building here in Kingsport. So normal CapEx growth to support our specialty strategy is in that $500 million to $600 million range. And then, of course, you've got a good portion of that $250 million of the Kingsport plant being spent next year. 
Now we're balancing some of the specialty CapEx between next year and pushing some of it to '23 to keep this sort of imbalance across the 2 years, but CapEx will be a bit higher for that. 
Then after that, you look at how am I going to deploy my balance sheet and cash, and there's really sort of four buckets. The first is the potential to continue investing in the circular economy. We're pursuing multiple projects beyond this first plant. 
If we can achieve the conditions that we've talked about in the past about those being very attractive investments and very stable sources of earnings, those projects could be very accretive to earnings and ROIC. They're very attractive from a return point of view. And that could be a use of where we go with our balance sheet. 
The second, of course, is bolt-on M&A where we'd like to ramp up that level from where we've been in the last couple of years. This is returning cash to shareholders, which I think will be significant as we move forward. And, of course, a growing dividend. 
So it will be a balance of capital deployment, I think, like we've always had across these areas. There's a lot of attractive investment opportunities for us right now. And so we're really excited about how we can sort of deploy capital and create growth for our shareholders."

That's another one of the differences, AFPs. Their automotive exposure is about half refinish and half OEMs. So they're a lot more balanced in the OEM production drama as refinished is just continuing to improve. 
But on the OEM side, the supply chain is really short between OEM production and the production of our interlayers. So that actually happens pretty quickly. So as they're adjusting their production rates weekly, we're adjusting right there with them. So we're realizing that in a pretty quick fashion. 
The performance films business has actually done really well through the third quarter because companies -- the dealers -- the auto dealers are out there trying to upgrade the value they were getting on each car. And so selling our paint protection films, window films was a nice adder to the few cars that they have to sell. 
But even that, seem start to catch up to us on what they have to sell right now. 
So we're feeling a bit of that as we go into the third -- the fourth quarter. 
But I think that as they have more cars to sell or produce more cars, you're going to see that pickup in sales happen pretty quickly for us because there's really no inventory in the channel between us and the primary market. So that, I think, is good news, as supply chains at some point are going to start getting back in control and production will be there. 
Clearly, end market demand is quite strong. So there's plenty of pent-up demand of people who want to buy cars. When you look at just how much they're paying for used cars right now, they're clearly -- there's a lot of demand out there. So I think, if we have a recovery, it will be pretty fast.

The two obvious questions that come up in the past is Fibers and olefins. On the Fibers front, I remind everyone that it is deeply integrated into our overall cellulosic biopolymer business. We have a lot of biopolymers, [indiscernible] as we're selling off of the stream in Advanced Materials and AFP. 
And with the significant change in the world's view around waste plastic and climate, we just have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us in both AM and AFP, with that integrated stream. 
You're going to learn a lot more about that at Innovation Day where we're going to identify a bunch of new opportunities we're pursuing that can be quite substantial. And textiles growth in itself, and Fibers, has been actually quite strong. It's incredible how the textile growth had been 80% up year-over-year, obviously, on the challenged market that still tremendous growth, offsetting not just total market decline, but also that discontinued product. 
So that business as well is at the position now where textile growth will offset to market decline or better. And where, in fact, demand exceeding our expectations, where we're having to pull forward conversion of tow assets to making textiles. So that business is on track and it generates a huge amount of cash flow that supports all the investments we're making in growth in AM and AFP. 
Olefins, it's a bit of a similar story where we're dramatically improving the quality of the earnings in that business. Obviously, it's doing really well. But we've been taking a lot of actions over the last 3 years to improve what is a new normal for this business, which is more likely probably around $300 million. 
And there are things like closing the Singapore plant where we had a very disadvantaged raw material energy position. That's a big upgrade in the quality of that business with it closed. A lot of operational cost transformation work that we're doing across the company does flow into the big assets that flow into Chemical Intermediates. 
The RGP investment is giving us flexibility to reduce ethylene when it's not attractive and make it when it is that it reduces sort of volatility around that. And we've got a new investment, we'll tell you about an Innovation Day for modest capital that will significantly improve our olefin production flexibility. 
And mix is getting better, right? The amines business inside that overall portfolio is great, growing and stable. And we have a lot of our businesses on cost pass-through contracts that give us a certain amount of stability, probably about 40% of ROCE. 
There's a lot of things in the olefins space we've done to improve it. We're obviously disciplined about our portfolio. But as you look at the significant growth opportunities we have in front of us and that balance sheet strength that we want to leverage, deploy and grow the company, the cash from both Fibers and olefins creates a lot of value. So when we look at the portfolio today for what we want to do now, this is the right portfolio to grow."

And so like many other chemical companies, you have to constantly fight that battle between businesses commoditizing and then innovating.

And obviously, we did significant portfolio change way ahead of many with the addition [ solutaminco ] and divesting a lot of commodity businesses. It's easy to forget history sometimes, but we moved out about $3.5 billion of commodities and added $4.2 billion of revenue in specialties out of $10 billion is a huge portfolio change. 
So we do really like a portfolio we have now. And yes, we had to optimize it around some underperforming businesses. And I'm proud of our teams delivering on that restructuring activity, which is never easy to sort of get to where we are. 
We don't really feel the need to get a lot bigger. We think we're at a good scale to continue to invest in fundamental R&D, product development as well as application development to grow. And I think that the circular economy, on top of very attractive specialty growth and where we could take that with multiple plants, is a game changer for how we can grow the company and how it could be valued. 
So we really are focusing a lot on how we focus on circular. We've got two extremely advantaged streams. Polyester and the way we can do circular economy is a very advantaged stream to grow in this current macro environment that wants to get rid of plastic waste and improve our impact on climate. 
And the cellulosic stream is also incredibly compelling. There's just a tremendous amount of opportunities when you've got a polymer that's 60% biopolymer with our new recycling technology there, 40% recycled plastic waste. And the biodegradability of the product is tunable for different applications. 
And that last part about biodegradability is increasingly important, and we'll tell you more about that in Innovation Day and some of the opportunities in front of us. 
So we see a lot of growth in capital deployment in that direction to deliver a lot of organic growth from the portfolio we have right now, where we don't really feel the pressure to run out and do some large M&A. And at the prices today for large M&A that's really attractive, you're going to have a challenged situation in getting a good return. So we don't really -- we're not really focusing on that."

There's no doubt that there's plenty of plastic waste. I mean, when you look at polyester just in the U.S., you've got over 20 million pounds of waste a year.

So as you tap into that stream and the advantage of methanolysis is it can use what can't be mechanical recycled from packaging, but it can also use carpet textiles, which almost all end up in landfill. So accessing 100,000 tons of feedstock out of that significantly large number when you're the first showing up to sort of secure, it is challenging but doable. 
And the infrastructure out there clearly needs to improve in the U.S. as we get consumers to recycle more and policy to support it and infrastructure in place to sort of recycle it as we look at plants 2, 3 and 4. 
But as we look at the first one, we're confident that we can do this, and we will provide more detail in Innovation Day. You're going to hear that a lot today about -- you'll get more detailed Innovation Day, but it's a better forum to provide more detail on this question, which is incredibly important, and we're very focused on it."

So when you think about it in the specialty plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in Tritan. Market demand exceeding our logistics capability serving the market, and we're even capacity constrained into the second quarter, which is why we co",592,"Yes. So when you think about it in the specialty plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in Tritan. Market demand exceeding our logistics capability serving the market, and we're even capacity constrained into the second quarter, which is why we converted line over to serve Tritan. And now, we've got that capacity coming in -- came [ online ] through the third quarter and a position to serve growth next year. 
And it's coming from a range of markets. So there's the traditional markets that are being driven with accelerated growth with our renewed recycled content like hydration that's delivering a lot of growth in housewares, those traditional markets that we've always grown in are being accelerated. 
And then on top of that, we're getting access to new markets that we wouldn't have normally had. The story we shared with you with Stanley Black & Decker a great example. I mean, it's a power tool. We're not normally in power tools. We normally go into optical clarity kind of applications with Tritan but this is the housings for power tools. 
And that customer adopted us because one, they're committed to addressing their Scope 3 climate from suppliers and recycled content was a way to start making progress on that, especially as our technology has a lower carbon footprint in a meaningful way relative to a normal fossil fuel process. 
And they wanted to maintain their quality, right? So a lot of these applications, you can't use mechanical recycling at all because when you're just blending mechanical recycling with virgin, the quality of the product goes down on multiple dimensions. 
And you can't have that kind of a compromise in the power tool. So we were able to provide recycled content, carbon footprint improvement, zero compromise on the performance of the product. And that's an incredibly important aspect of why we're growing. 
And then the third part of it was actually a partnership for them. So they want to make sure they're aligned with a company that could scale with them and it was going to be a reliable supplier of this product. There's a lot of companies starting up out there, but they're start-ups, right? And they haven't scaled their technology. 
So when we can show up and provide a product where we've been -- have a 40-year history in doing methanolysis and we've got 100 years of history of supplying products to people very reliably, that was incredibly important to them and who they're going to choose. And we've had 10 other AM's sign up in this quarter -- in the third quarter for those sort of similar set of [ reasons ], which we'll tell you more about. 
But we're really well positioned. It's not just Tritan. It's crystal renew, which is our high clarity copolyester recycled content and cosmetic packaging. It's a wide spectrum of things, including our cellulosic into eyewear, et cetera. So a lot of growth in SP. 
Obviously, the interlayers in performance films businesses are tied to the auto production recovery as we discussed. But mix is still important, and we still see the mix improving faster than the absolute volume in production because the first thing that the OEMs are going to produce are more luxury high-end value cars when they start addressing their chip and component shortages. 
And we'll pick up that volume with our products are aligned with that market and the mix value of that is also incredibly important. So a lot of growth that can occur across the entire segment."

So add to them ramping up just to build inventory to serve the seasonal demand next year is good as the supply chain issues continue to get resolved on a availability point of view. So I think, we'll continue to see very strong growth there. 
The care chemicals business has great steady growth, same with water treatment that will continue going into next year. And then [ Animal Nutrition ] is really accelerating their growth in higher-value formulated solutions through the 3F acquisition. And there's, of course, recovery in the aviation business. So there's a lot of different vectors across the entire segment that remains that's well-positioned for growth in the markets that it serves. 
And then of course, we've got innovation like Tetrashield in the packaging that will be a vector of growth. And continued growth in some of the care chemical opportunities and some really exciting new ones that we'll tell you about on Innovation Day."

As. demand gets a little bit more sort of balanced, those spot sales go away, and that's a bit of that headwind you're going to see from 3Q to 4Q for CI. 
But the overall fundamental dynamics of these markets at the derivative level, in particular, I think we expect to remain reasonably tight as we go into the first half of next year and then assume normalization towards that $300 million level in long-term.

And that is based on -- when you look at it relative to '21, an improvement in volume and mix that's been meaningful. 
Spreads are probably a bit challenged relative to '18 just as pricing is still catching up to raws. But overall, very well-positioned segment to deliver pretty strong earnings growth next year relative to that recast number.

Raw materials  are up everywhere, but obviously, prices are up more than raw materials and CI where we're lagging price-wise in the specialties. 
Those two do hedge each other out. That actually provides earnings stability. So if you're focused on earnings stability, a bit of a balance when you've got CI at just 20% of your earnings actually provides some benefits in times like this as your prices are catching up to specialties. And the opposite will be true next year as the price and spreads will improve and the specialty, obviously, you're going to have some spread normalization in CI. 
The important part of our strategy and our story is not spread, right? We've been very clear about this, right? Our strategy is growing volume and high-value mix in that volume against an asset base that we continue to upgrade with that mix to deliver increasing ROIC as well as deploying more capital for that high-value mix.

We were thinking we have swing assets where we can make our specialty plastics or PET for packaging. And we thought we'd actually be selling a lot of PET for packaging, and that's looking like that's not going to be the case because the specialty demand is so strong. 
So I think, we're in very good position for loading the asset pretty quickly into the markets. We're not going to disclose the specific percent number. But I think, it's going to be quite robust and quick. 
As regards to demand that goes beyond our first plant, yes, the demand is very much there. And that's why we're working so diligently right now with countries and brands around the world, especially in U.S. and Europe right now, who want to solve those challenges. 
When the brands look at this situation, right? They've got two goals. They got to address packaging waste, specifically plastic waste is getting a lot of attention. But if you switch to plastics [indiscernible] else, you still got to manage that waste. 
And so as you look at this, they've committed to very high recycled content targets, and there isn't remotely enough mechanical recycling product out there to supply that need reliably. In addition, the price of mechanical recycled rPET is going up dramatically in Europe and now as well in the U.S. And the brands are worried about how much that's going to keep going up. 
And they are also doing life cycle analysis on the carbon footprint of not just plastic, but alternative materials that they could consider. And unfortunately, you run into a problem, which is all the alternative materials have a worse climate footprint. You recently saw Wendy's switched from coated paper cups to plastic because plastics got a much better climate footprint and can be recycled where the coated paper cannot be recycled. 
So the brands are very focused on how to recycle plastic for a lot of applications and realizing that molecular recycling is the only way forward, especially long-term, if you want to keep your product quality the same, then mechanical recycle is limited in how it can be used. And it degrades over time. 
So if you want an infinite solution, you've got to have molecular recycling as part of the solution. 
So engagement is strong. The need to build more plants is there. And we're driving to find a way to do that under the right conditions. And they are attracted to us because our scale -- our technology is scalable now where the start-ups are still sort of piloting and trying to figure out how to scale up. So that's also drawing a lot of attention to us. 
So we feel good about where we're at. We're excited about doing this. But to be clear, we're not going to build any additional plants unless we get the sort of contractual commitments for offtake to give us stable earnings."

Well, first of all, they're actually a great complement of technologies together at this site because we have a unique proprietary way to separate unsorted waste plastic that just separate it from polyester to everything else at a much lower cost. So",233,"Yes. Well, first of all, they're actually a great complement of technologies together at this site because we have a unique proprietary way to separate unsorted waste plastic that just separate it from polyester to everything else at a much lower cost. So that's one of the feedstock sourcing advantage that we have that I should have mentioned earlier. 
And that allows us to take that mixed waste plastic in the CRT, take it into our acetyl stream and make cellulosic biopolymers that gives us a lot of sourcing flexibility. So we see both technologies creating a lot of value, and the CRT is also, through the cellulosic, drawing a lot of attention. 
We've always had -- we've had a biopolymer for 100 years, if you want to go back to acetate film with Kodak. And we've created this huge spectrum of applications off of that core technology in AM, AFP and Fibers. 
But with the recent change in focusing on climate, focusing on plastic waste, instead of recycling, you can also have biodegradable products as a way to sort of have circular life and that's drawing a lot of attention around the cellulosic stream. We can take back polymer and put it back in the CRT or we can also provide ones that biodegrade based on the application. So a lot of interesting growth there as well that we're really excited about."

I think, what I'd say is we're sharing our best thinking with you right now of what we know. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty in the future. 
Things we're certain about is we know we can control our costs, right? And we have a very aggressive transformation program going that when you look at operational transformation cost cutting plus variable comp tailwind, that's about $200 million of tailwind that offsets about $80 million to $100 million of inflation. 
We know that we're going to invest in growing this business. We have tremendous growth opportunities right there across our portfolio. And so we have growth investments in that sort of $50 million to $75 million range that is controllable. We can control the pace of that based on how the market is doing. And that does include some preproduction expense on starting up methanol and some other plants when you think about that number. 
But those are controllable. Obviously, there's uncertainty about where CI is going to go. I think we've got a reasonable assumption, but we'll see. We'll defer to the -- to some other companies on that and where the markets are. 
And then on the specialty side, what I'd say is we do feel good about the growth potential, the innovation to create levered growth on these markets and that spreads will be a tailwind. But there's still a lot of uncertainty about automotive demand as many of these questions have highlighted, there's uncertainty about where raw materials are going to trend and how they progress from where we are now into next year as well as distribution costs. 
So there's a lot of uncertainties out there that none of us can, frankly, predict. 
So what we're confident is if you look at it in three buckets, you've got divested earnings offset by share repurchases. You got a bucket of CI spread normalization offset by cost reductions. And then you're asking a question, which is can specialties grow next year relative to this year in variable margin. And I think we've laid out a case where we think the answer to that is very much yes. 
But I'm not going to get into trying to be more precise about that until we get to January. We're going to have a better look at the world we live in at that point."
