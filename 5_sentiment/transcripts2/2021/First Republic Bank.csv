We have been consistently profitable each year for the 35 years since our founding in 1985. 2020 loan origination volume was over $50 billion, a record. Importantly, we were able to fully fund our loan growth with deposit book. Wealth management assets grew more than $43 billion during the year and are now just short of $200 billion. Importantly, the majority of the growth during the year was driven by net client inflows. 
This year has proven, once again, the resilience of our high-touch, client-centric service model, both delivered in person and through digital channels. The trusted relationships between our bankers and our clients have proven to be more important than their social proximity. In fact, early results show that our 2020 Net Promoter Score, the major of our client satisfaction is at least as high as the prior year. This client satisfaction level is more than twice the banking industry's average, and is our growth driver. 
Gaye will discuss in a moment how we are further using technology to enhance this client service experience. Our continuing consistent performance under a wide range of economic conditions, demonstrates the stability and long-term nature and power of our client service model. Let me cover a few metrics for the year. Total loans outstanding were up 22%. The total deposits have grown 28%, and wealth management assets increased 29%. This strong growth, in turn, has led to strong financial performance. 
Year-over-year, our revenues grew 17%. Net interest income grew 18%. And and the real bottom line, tangible book value per share has increased more than 14% during the year. Most importantly, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Maintaining consistently strong credit in all economic and market environments is a hallmark and a focus of First Republic. Net charge-offs for the entire year were only $2.4 million, less than 1 single basis points of average loans. During the year, we did add $157 million to our reserves. In the fourth quarter, we actually had net recoveries of $600,000, and nonperforming assets have ended the year at only 13 basis points. 
Our capital remains quite strong. At year-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.14%. This includes the benefit of 3 successful capital raises during 2020. Mike will touch on these in a moment. 
I would note that First Republic does not engage in common share buybacks. As we head into 2021, our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is quite strong. Our pipeline is up from the same time last year. The lower rate environment continued to represent a terrific opportunity for single-family residential purchases and refinance. Single-family residential lending continues to be the primary driver of our growth, representing 2/3 of our loan growth during the year. I would note that loan originations have some seasonality, with the fourth quarter typically being quite strong and the first quarter typically being a little bit slower. December was the 10th anniversary of our second IPO, which we did shortly after we bought First Republic bank back from the BoFA in 2010. During these 10 years, total loans have grown 20% compounded annually, total deposits have grown 20% compounded annually, and total bank assets have grown 20% compounded annually. And wealth management assets have grown 28% compounded annually. 
Our shareholders have also done well. In 2010, we went public at a price of $25.50 per share. Shareholder value has compounded at 21% per year since that time, including dividends. This is more than 2x the S&P 500 during the same period, and nearly 3.5x the KBW Bank index for the same period. 
These results reflect our steadfast focus on delivering extraordinary client service, which, in turn, drives consistent organic growth. 
Overall, it was a very successful quarter and a very successful full year. Now let me turn the call over to Guy Erkan, our President."
272383,699728255,2172294,"First Republic Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,"Earnings Calls","First Republic Bank","Executives","Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic.

We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more than 600 net new colleagues to the organization, and rolled out a number of new benefits to support the well-being of our colleagues. We made more than 4,000 client fanal loan modifications for our clients impacted by COVID. We delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and nonprofit clients. We did this all, while originating a record number of loans. 
Let me now turn to an update on lendings. Loan originations for the year, excluding PPP, were $51 billion. Single-family residential volume for the year was a record at $24 billion. 
Refinance activity, which was particularly robust, accounted for 66% of single-family volume during the year. As we have noted before, refinance continues to be a strong means of acquiring new clients. In terms of credit, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the year was just 55%. 
Turning to business banking, growth of loans and line commitments was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the Paycheck Protection Program. During the fourth quarter, business line utilization increased to 38%. This is in line with our historical utilization range of mid- to high 30s. 
In terms of funding, it was a record year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, or 28% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Check-in deposits represented 67% of total deposits at year-end. Business deposits represented 57% of total deposits at year-end. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 11 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 31 basis points. 
In wealth Management, assets grew 29% year-over-year and are now over $194 billion. Well over half of this growth came from net client inflow. Our integrated banking and wealth management model continues to attract very successful wealth managers. During 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed 8 new wealth management teams, including 2 teams in Bellview, Washington, a key part of the greater Seattle market. We plan to open a preferred banking office in Bellview later this year to further establish our presence in the market. 
As we grow our business safely and organically, we continue to make investments to further reinforce and scale our differentiated service model through an agile tech strategy and continuous process improvements. Our strategy is focused on using technology to enhance human-to-human relationships between clients and our bankers, not to replace them. We are doing this by empowering our bankers with actionable insights and tools to reduce transactional time and maximize emotional time with their clients, and also by rapidly developing and rolling out additional digital capabilities, which allow for a customized and convenient experience for our clients. 
2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy. During the year, and in the midst of the pandemic, approximately 70% of our mortgage applications were submitted digitally. We redesigned our corporate mobile app, leading to an increase in active users by more than 40%. We tripled the number of digital deposit account openings. We released one new digital banking feature per week on average. We doubled task automation and gave back 150,000 hours annually to our bankers to further delight their clients. These time savings are equivalent to a 1.5% workforce expansion. 
These achievements were enabled by our unique tech strategy, continued operational investments and focus on omnichannel client experience with enhanced connectivity to their trusted bankers. As a result, over the past several years, the number of client households served per banker has increased significantly, while we have maintained our Net Promoter Score consistently double the industry average, as Jim mentioned earlier. 
Overall, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at First Republic, we have successfully navigated a challenging year. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Michael Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Let me review the results for the year and quarter and also offer some guidance for 2021. Our capital position remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we successfully raised $225 million of common stock and completed the redemption of the Series F preferred stock. In total, during 2020, we added over $900 million of net new Tier 1 capital. Liquidity also remains strong, as high-quality liquid assets were 12.8% of average total assets in the fourth quarter. 
Our credit quality remains excellent. Our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $35 million. This provision was driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth. As Jim mentioned, for the entire year, net charge-offs were only $2.4 million, 1/4 of 1 basis point of average loans. 
Over this period, we added $157 million to our reserves. We're pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At year-end, COVID modifications totaled only 1.1% of the total portfolio, down from 3.7% on September 30. 
In 2020, loans were up a very strong 22%, excluding PPP. For 2021, loan growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range. Our net interest margin has remained stable at 2.73% for the fourth quarter and 2.72% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, consistent with current levels. Within this range, our net interest margin may be influenced by higher cash levels as a result of current economic conditions and government stimulus. 
Our efficiency ratio was 61.6% for the fourth quarter and 61.9% for the full year 2020. As a reminder, the efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced marketing, travel and events due to the pandemic. 
For 2021, a the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 62% to 64% as we continue to invest in our business and regulatory infrastructure. 
Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%, assuming no change to the corporate tax rate. 
Overall, it was a very strong year that speaks to the sustainable power of our client service model. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

The problem on the purchase side of supply, actually, not demand. I would think that the -- with 66% of our loan business in single-family this year was refinanced. That would probably slow down, and, in fact, we think it may anyway because the rates are already up a little bit. We don't worry about a move that will be destructive to the market. Rates -- mortgage rates are going out at the high 2s, low 3s, but mostly high 2s. I don't think the low 3s to the mid-3s slows down purchase finance very much. It does slow down refinance, I think."

Office space is clearly available in the cities we operate in. We can't speak about others, but the cities we operate in, there's, all of a sudden, a bit of an excess of office space.

And we see that we are getting the same great next-gen clients who are actually slightly further along in their lives, and closer to buying a home or already refinancing with us. So -- and the digital investments in the next-gen population, while they value the human-to-human relationship, at least the clients who choose First Republic, digital and mobile-first is important. So all the investments we have been making all along have been paying off handsomely in serving our clients in the next-gen population."

So we're seeing less of a penetration into the jumbo market more into the conforming and the [ 30 ] fixed base. What I would say just from a -- to take a step back, from a model perspective is fintechs are disrupting the banking sector. The scarce commodity increasingly is going to be the trusted team and relationships and the customization elements that are going to be harder to find. And that's exactly our First Republic shines. So we see fintechs more partnerships and collaborations that actually decreases transactional time and increases emotional time to allow for further customization. So we are using a lot of such collaborations to do that as well as internal direct investments into technology to further empower the client and our bankers who are actually making the magic happen. So if you put all that together, the models actual balance itself, and in the markets that we are in, we after so may -- 35-plus years, we still have just about 5% market share. Great opportunity in the Seattle market, for example, in Florida and Wyoming, and a very successful next-gen millennial strategy.

We have been consistently profitable each year for the 35 years since our founding in 1985. 2020 loan origination volume was over $50 billion, a record. Importantly, we were able to fully fund our loan growth with deposit book. Wealth management assets grew more than $43 billion during the year and are now just short of $200 billion. Importantly, the majority of the growth during the year was driven by net client inflows.
This year has proven, once again, the resilience of our high-touch, client-centric service model, both delivered in person and through digital channels. The trusted relationships between our bankers and our clients have proven to be more important than their social proximity. In fact, early results show that our 2020 Net Promoter Score, the measure of our client satisfaction, is at least as high as the prior year. This client satisfaction level is more than twice the banking industry's average, and is our growth driver.
Gaye will discuss in a moment how we are further using technology to enhance this client service experience. Our continuing consistent performance under a wide range of economic conditions demonstrates the stability and long-term nature and power of our client service model.
Let me cover a few metrics for the year. Total loans outstanding were up 22%. The total deposits have grown 28%, and wealth management assets increased 29%. This strong growth, in turn, has led to strong financial performance. 
Year-over-year, our revenues grew 17%. Net interest income grew 18%. And the real bottom line, tangible book value per share has increased more than 14% during the year. Most importantly, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Maintaining consistently strong credit in all economic and market environments is a hallmark and a focus of First Republic.
Net charge-offs for the entire year were only $2.4 million, less than 1 single basis points of average loans. During the year, we did add $157 million to our reserves. In the fourth quarter, we actually had net recoveries of $600,000, and nonperforming assets have ended the year at only 13 basis points.
Our capital remains quite strong. At year-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.14%. This includes the benefit of 3 successful capital raises during 2020. Mike will touch on these in a moment.
I would note that First Republic does not engage in common share buybacks. As we head into 2021, our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is quite strong. Our pipeline is up from the same time last year. The lower rate environment continued to represent a terrific opportunity for single-family residential purchases and refinance. Single-family residential lending continues to be the primary driver of our growth, representing 2/3 of our loan growth during the year. 
I would note that loan originations have some seasonality, with the fourth quarter typically being quite strong and the first quarter typically being a little bit slower. December was the 10th anniversary of our second IPO, which we did shortly after we bought First Republic Bank back from the BoFA in 2010. During these 10 years, total loans have grown 20% compounded annually, total deposits have grown 20% compounded annually, and total bank assets have grown 20% compounded annually and wealth management assets have grown 28% compounded annually.
Our shareholders have also done well. In 2010, we went public at a price of $25.50 per share. Shareholder value has compounded at 21% per year since that time, including dividends. This is more than 2x the S&P 500 during the same period and nearly 3.5x the KBW Bank Index for the same period. These results reflect our steadfast focus on delivering extraordinary client service, which, in turn, drives consistent organic growth.
Overall, it was a very successful quarter and a very successful full year. Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, our President."

We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more",679,"Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more than 600 net new colleagues to the organization, and rolled out a number of new benefits to support the well-being of our colleagues. We made more than 4,000 client [indiscernible] loan modifications for our clients impacted by COVID. We delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and nonprofit clients. We did this all while originating a record number of loans. 
Let me now turn to an update on lending. Loan originations for the year, excluding PPP, were $51 billion. Single-family residential volume for the year was a record at $24 billion. Refinance activity, which was particularly robust, accounted for 66% of single-family volume during the year. As we have noted before, refinance continues to be a strong means of acquiring new clients. In terms of credit, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the year was just 55%. 
Turning to business banking. Growth of loans and line commitments was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the Paycheck Protection Program. During the fourth quarter, business line utilization increased to 38%. This is in line with our historical utilization range of mid- to high 30s. 
In terms of funding, it was a record year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, or 28% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Check-in deposits represented 67% of total deposits at year-end. Business deposits represented 57% of total deposits at year-end. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 11 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 31 basis points.
In wealth management, assets grew 29% year-over-year and are now over $194 billion. Well over half of this growth came from net client inflow. Our integrated banking and wealth management model continues to attract very successful wealth managers. During 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed 8 new wealth management teams, including 2 teams in Bellevue, Washington, a key part of the greater Seattle market. We plan to open a preferred banking office in Bellevue later this year to further establish our presence in the market.
As we grow our business safely and organically, we continue to make investments to further reinforce and scale our differentiated service model through an agile tech strategy and continuous process improvements. Our strategy is focused on using technology to enhance human-to-human relationships between clients and our bankers, not to replace them. We are doing this by empowering our bankers with actionable insights and tools to reduce transactional time and maximize emotional time with their clients, and also by rapidly developing and rolling out additional digital capabilities, which allow for a customized and convenient experience for our clients.
2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy. During the year, and in the midst of the pandemic, approximately 70% of our mortgage applications were submitted digitally. We redesigned our corporate mobile app, leading to an increase in active users by more than 40%. We tripled the number of digital deposit account openings. We released one new digital banking feature per week on average. We doubled task automation and gave back 150,000 hours annually to our bankers to further delight their clients. These time savings are equivalent to a 1.5% workforce expansion.
These achievements were enabled by our unique tech strategy, continued operational investments and focus on omnichannel client experience with enhanced connectivity to their trusted bankers. As a result, over the past several years, the number of client households served per banker has increased significantly, while we have maintained our Net Promoter Score consistently double the industry average, as Jim mentioned earlier. 
Overall, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at First Republic, we have successfully navigated a challenging year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Let me review the results for the year and quarter and also offer some guidance for 2021. Our capital position remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we successfully raised $225 million of common stock and completed the redemption of the Series F preferred stock. In total, during 2020, we added over $900 million of net new Tier 1 capital. Liquidity also remains strong, as high-quality liquid assets were 12.8% of average total assets in the fourth quarter. 
Our credit quality remains excellent. Our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $35 million. This provision was driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth. As Jim mentioned, for the entire year, net charge-offs were only $2.4 million, one quarter of 1 basis point of average loans. 
Over this period, we added $157 million to our reserves. We're pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At year-end, COVID modifications totaled only 1.1% of the total portfolio, down from 3.7% on September 30. 
In 2020, loans were up a very strong 22%, excluding PPP. For 2021, loan growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range. Our net interest margin has remained stable at 2.73% for the fourth quarter and 2.72% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%, consistent with current levels. Within this range, our net interest margin may be influenced by higher cash levels as a result of current economic conditions and government stimulus.
Our efficiency ratio was 61.6% for the fourth quarter and 61.9% for the full year 2020. As a reminder, the efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced marketing, travel and events due to the pandemic. For 2021, a the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 62% to 64% as we continue to invest in our business and regulatory infrastructure. 
Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%, assuming no change to the corporate tax rate. 
Overall, it was a very strong year that speaks to the sustainable power of our client service model. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

Why you will have a rise in rates at the -- you'll have a rise -- a slowdown in refinance. Purchase finance may not slow down all that much because demand is very high. The problem on the purchase side is supply, actually, not demand. I would think that the -- 66% of our loan business in single-family this year was refinance. That would probably slow down, and, in fact, we think it may anyway because the rates are already up a little bit. 
We don't worry about a move that will be destructive to the market. Rates -- mortgage rates are going out at the high 2s, low 3s, but mostly high 2s. I don't think the low 3s to the mid-3s slows down purchase finance very much. It does slow down refinance, I think."

Office space is clearly available in the cities we operate in. We can't speak about others, but the cities we operate in, there's, all of a sudden, a bit of an excess of office space. New York is particularly, I think, hit hard. But it's also -- but rental, particularly in new A buildings are finding a rental level that is being signed up, probably down 15% from what it was before. 
The question is, how far down it will ripple in the quality stream from A to B to C properties. And that's not yet clear. Single-family is another matter.

I just take the average 5 years of loan growth, you're also up 20% a year. Like what response would you have to someone who says that maybe your 15% is probably just a little bit too low?

Our client-facing people, their role is to serve the client need and client demand for whatever it might exist, be it deposit activity, wealth activity or home loan buying or businesses. So when we sort of start the year, we feel that, that's an appropriate measure based on sort of client demand, maybe the economic environment, how we're feeling about our different geographies. And we've, obviously, outperformed that over a sustained period of time, but we're not going to chase either.
The first question, I think, we're talking about higher rates. And does that impact volume? That does impact some refinance activity and a lot of our refinance activity comes from other banks. And so that also has an impact. So I think we think it's a prudent way to plan and to estimate, but also do what the good business is right in front of us and not try to stretch for it."

And we remain conservative in terms of repayments generally within 180 days. So -- and then on the single-family residential side, 66% of the originations were refi.

And Gaye mentioned some of the agency paper at 1.25% is not really attractive right now. And given our loan demand, we'd rather carry a bit of cash balance and put it into client activity versus securities. I mean, I think the last couple of quarters, our margin has been very stable 2.72%, 2.73%. And we've sort of found a pretty good place with the example Gaye gave about current loan yields or earning asset yields around 3% and funding cost 30 or slightly less.
The variability largely, I think, will come from the amount of cash we hold, right? So I think you saw the cash balances up on average a little bit in the fourth quarter. And yet, we still were around -- the margin was actually expanded slightly. So we're in a pretty good place, but I don't think that -- unless competition moves up mortgage rates, I don't think there's a big chance of sort of outside of the range at this point."

So we're seeing less of a penetration into jumbo market more into the conforming and the 30-year fixed base. What I would say just from a -- to take a step back, from a model perspective is fintechs are disrupting the banking sector. The scarce commodity increasingly is going to be the trusted team and relationships and the customization elements that are going to be harder to find. And that's exactly our First Republic shines. So we see fintechs more partnerships and collaborations that actually decreases transactional time and increases emotional time to allow for further customization. 
So we are using a lot of such collaborations to do that as well as internal direct investments into technology to further empower the client and our bankers who are actually making the magic happen. So if you put all that together, the models actually balance itself, and in the markets that we are in, we are -- after so may -- 35-plus years, we still have just about 5% market share. Great opportunity in the Seattle market, for example, in Florida and Wyoming, and a very successful next-gen millennial strategy. So bringing back to some of the expense questions, there are so many great, safe and sound organic growth opportunities ahead of First Republic. So we're bound to take advantage of those even in the face of the disruption, which actually allows us to increase the customization."

We have been consistently profitable each year for the 35 years since our founding in 1985. 2020 loan origination volume was over $50 billion, a record. Importantly, we were able to fully fund our loan growth with deposit book. Wealth management assets grew more than $43 billion during the year and are now just short of $200 billion. Importantly, the majority of the growth during the year was driven by net client inflows.
This year has proven, once again, the resilience of our high-touch, client-centric service model, both delivered in person and through digital channels. The trusted relationships between our bankers and our clients have proven to be more important than their social proximity. In fact, early results show that our 2020 Net Promoter Score, the measure of our client satisfaction, is at least as high as the prior year. This client satisfaction level is more than twice the banking industry's average, and is our growth driver.
Gaye will discuss in a moment how we are further using technology to enhance this client service experience. Our continuing consistent performance under a wide range of economic conditions demonstrates the stability and long-term nature and power of our client service model.
Let me cover a few metrics for the year. Total loans outstanding were up 22%. The total deposits have grown 28%, and wealth management assets increased 29%. This strong growth, in turn, has led to strong financial performance. 
Year-over-year, our revenues grew 17%. Net interest income grew 18%. And the real bottom line, tangible book value per share has increased more than 14% during the year. Most importantly, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Maintaining consistently strong credit in all economic and market environments is a hallmark and a focus of First Republic.
Net charge-offs for the entire year were only $2.4 million, less than 1 single basis points of average loans. During the year, we did add $157 million to our reserves. In the fourth quarter, we actually had net recoveries of $600,000, and nonperforming assets have ended the year at only 13 basis points.
Our capital remains quite strong. At year-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.14%. This includes the benefit of 3 successful capital raises during 2020. Mike will touch on these in a moment.
I would note that First Republic does not engage in common share buybacks. As we head into 2021, our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is quite strong. Our pipeline is up from the same time last year. The lower rate environment continued to represent a terrific opportunity for single-family residential purchases and refinance. Single-family residential lending continues to be the primary driver of our growth, representing 2/3 of our loan growth during the year. 
I would note that loan originations have some seasonality, with the fourth quarter typically being quite strong and the first quarter typically being a little bit slower. December was the 10th anniversary of our second IPO, which we did shortly after we bought First Republic Bank back from the BoFA in 2010. During these 10 years, total loans have grown 20% compounded annually, total deposits have grown 20% compounded annually, and total bank assets have grown 20% compounded annually and wealth management assets have grown 28% compounded annually.
Our shareholders have also done well. In 2010, we went public at a price of $25.50 per share. Shareholder value has compounded at 21% per year since that time, including dividends. This is more than 2x the S&P 500 during the same period and nearly 3.5x the KBW Bank Index for the same period. These results reflect our steadfast focus on delivering extraordinary client service, which, in turn, drives consistent organic growth.
Overall, it was a very successful quarter and a very successful full year. Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, our President."
272383,699728255,2172408,"First Republic Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,"Earnings Calls","First Republic Bank","Executives","Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more",679,"Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more than 600 net new colleagues to the organization, and rolled out a number of new benefits to support the well-being of our colleagues. We made more than 4,000 client [indiscernible] loan modifications for our clients impacted by COVID. We delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and nonprofit clients. We did this all while originating a record number of loans. 
Let me now turn to an update on lending. Loan originations for the year, excluding PPP, were $51 billion. Single-family residential volume for the year was a record at $24 billion. Refinance activity, which was particularly robust, accounted for 66% of single-family volume during the year. As we have noted before, refinance continues to be a strong means of acquiring new clients. In terms of credit, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the year was just 55%. 
Turning to business banking. Growth of loans and line commitments was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the Paycheck Protection Program. During the fourth quarter, business line utilization increased to 38%. This is in line with our historical utilization range of mid- to high 30s. 
In terms of funding, it was a record year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, or 28% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Check-in deposits represented 67% of total deposits at year-end. Business deposits represented 57% of total deposits at year-end. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 11 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 31 basis points.
In wealth management, assets grew 29% year-over-year and are now over $194 billion. Well over half of this growth came from net client inflow. Our integrated banking and wealth management model continues to attract very successful wealth managers. During 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed 8 new wealth management teams, including 2 teams in Bellevue, Washington, a key part of the greater Seattle market. We plan to open a preferred banking office in Bellevue later this year to further establish our presence in the market.
As we grow our business safely and organically, we continue to make investments to further reinforce and scale our differentiated service model through an agile tech strategy and continuous process improvements. Our strategy is focused on using technology to enhance human-to-human relationships between clients and our bankers, not to replace them. We are doing this by empowering our bankers with actionable insights and tools to reduce transactional time and maximize emotional time with their clients, and also by rapidly developing and rolling out additional digital capabilities, which allow for a customized and convenient experience for our clients.
2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy. During the year, and in the midst of the pandemic, approximately 70% of our mortgage applications were submitted digitally. We redesigned our corporate mobile app, leading to an increase in active users by more than 40%. We tripled the number of digital deposit account openings. We released one new digital banking feature per week on average. We doubled task automation and gave back 150,000 hours annually to our bankers to further delight their clients. These time savings are equivalent to a 1.5% workforce expansion.
These achievements were enabled by our unique tech strategy, continued operational investments and focus on omnichannel client experience with enhanced connectivity to their trusted bankers. As a result, over the past several years, the number of client households served per banker has increased significantly, while we have maintained our Net Promoter Score consistently double the industry average, as Jim mentioned earlier. 
Overall, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at First Republic, we have successfully navigated a challenging year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

During the fourth quarter, we successfully raised $225 million of common stock and completed the redemption of the Series F preferred stock. In total, during 2020, we added over $900 million of net new Tier 1 capital. Liquidity also remains strong, as high-quality liquid assets were 12.8% of average total assets in the fourth quarter. 
Our credit quality remains excellent. Our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $35 million. This provision was driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth. As Jim mentioned, for the entire year, net charge-offs were only $2.4 million, one quarter of 1 basis point of average loans. 
Over this period, we added $157 million to our reserves. We're pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At year-end, COVID modifications totaled only 1.1% of the total portfolio, down from 3.7% on September 30. 
In 2020, loans were up a very strong 22%, excluding PPP. For 2021, loan growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range. Our net interest margin has remained stable at 2.73% for the fourth quarter and 2.72% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%, consistent with current levels. Within this range, our net interest margin may be influenced by higher cash levels as a result of current economic conditions and government stimulus.
Our efficiency ratio was 61.6% for the fourth quarter and 61.9% for the full year 2020. As a reminder, the efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced marketing, travel and events due to the pandemic. For 2021, a the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 62% to 64% as we continue to invest in our business and regulatory infrastructure. 
Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%, assuming no change to the corporate tax rate. 
Overall, it was a very strong year that speaks to the sustainable power of our client service model. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

Why you will have a rise in rates at the -- you'll have a rise -- a slowdown in refinance. Purchase finance may not slow down all that much because demand is very high. The problem on the purchase side is supply, actually, not demand. I would think that the -- 66% of our loan business in single-family this year was refinance. That would probably slow down, and, in fact, we think it may anyway because the rates are already up a little bit. 
We don't worry about a move that will be destructive to the market. Rates -- mortgage rates are going out at the high 2s, low 3s, but mostly high 2s. I don't think the low 3s to the mid-3s slows down purchase finance very much. It does slow down refinance, I think."

Office space is clearly available in the cities we operate in. We can't speak about others, but the cities we operate in, there's, all of a sudden, a bit of an excess of office space. New York is particularly, I think, hit hard.

So on the capital call line, private equity has been quite strong with active deal flow, stronger realized gains and a new fund formation, particularly towards the end of the year. The strong momentum we expect to continue into 2021 as well, given the low yields and all-time high equities attracting more investors into private equity. And the utilization rates do vary. So we look at the commitments growth, as you have seen that the commitments growth has been quite strong, especially in the capital call line, about 35% sales growth and commitments. And we remain conservative in terms of repayments generally within 180 days. So -- and then on the single-family residential side, 66% of the originations were refi. Out of those refis, over 60% were acquiring new clients, clients with loans at other banks. So continues to be a very strong means of client acquisition."

I think that we're entering the year with the market enthusiastic about potential curve steepening. So as we think about the net interest margin range, which has stayed steady, how should we think about -- at what level of front book rates, would you be more compelled to redeploy the cash that you have?

And Gaye mentioned some of the agency paper at 1.25% is not really attractive right now. And given our loan demand, we'd rather carry a bit of cash balance and put it into client activity versus securities. I mean, I think the last couple of quarters, our margin has been very stable 2.72%, 2.73%. And we've sort of found a pretty good place with the example Gaye gave about current loan yields or earning asset yields around 3% and funding cost 30 or slightly less.
The variability largely, I think, will come from the amount of cash we hold, right? So I think you saw the cash balances up on average a little bit in the fourth quarter. And yet, we still were around -- the margin was actually expanded slightly. So we're in a pretty good place, but I don't think that -- unless competition moves up mortgage rates, I don't think there's a big chance of sort of outside of the range at this point."

And that's a result of a slowdown in competition during the sort of first half of the year, at least, and actually still continuing.

So we're seeing less of a penetration into jumbo market more into the conforming and the 30-year fixed base. What I would say just from a -- to take a step back, from a model perspective is fintechs are disrupting the banking sector. The scarce commodity increasingly is going to be the trusted team and relationships and the customization elements that are going to be harder to find. And that's exactly our First Republic shines. So we see fintechs more partnerships and collaborations that actually decreases transactional time and increases emotional time to allow for further customization. 
So we are using a lot of such collaborations to do that as well as internal direct investments into technology to further empower the client and our bankers who are actually making the magic happen. So if you put all that together, the models actually balance itself, and in the markets that we are in, we are -- after so may -- 35-plus years, we still have just about 5% market share. Great opportunity in the Seattle market, for example, in Florida and Wyoming, and a very successful next-gen millennial strategy. So bringing back to some of the expense questions, there are so many great, safe and sound organic growth opportunities ahead of First Republic. So we're bound to take advantage of those even in the face of the disruption, which actually allows us to increase the customization."

We have been consistently profitable each year for the 35 years since our founding in 1985. 2020 loan origination volume was over $50 billion, a record. Importantly, we were able to fully fund our loan growth with deposit book. Wealth management assets grew more than $43 billion during the year and are now just short of $200 billion. Importantly, the majority of the growth during the year was driven by net client inflows.
This year has proven, once again, the resilience of our high-touch, client-centric service model, both delivered in person and through digital channels. The trusted relationships between our bankers and our clients have proven to be more important than their social proximity. In fact, early results show that our 2020 Net Promoter Score, the measure of our client satisfaction, is at least as high as the prior year. This client satisfaction level is more than twice the banking industry's average and is our growth driver.
Gaye will discuss in a moment how we are further using technology to enhance this client service experience. Our continuing consistent performance under a wide range of economic conditions demonstrates the stability and long-term nature and power of our client service model.
Let me cover a few metrics for the year. Total loans outstanding were up 22%. The total deposits have grown 28%, and wealth management assets increased 29%. This strong growth, in turn, has led to strong financial performance. 
Year-over-year, our revenues grew 17%. Net interest income grew 18%. And the real bottom line, tangible book value per share has increased more than 14% during the year. Most importantly, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Maintaining consistently strong credit in all economic and market environments is a hallmark and a focus of First Republic.
Net charge-offs for the entire year were only $2.4 million, less than 1 single basis points of average loans. During the year, we did add $157 million to our reserves. In the fourth quarter, we actually had net recoveries of $600,000, and nonperforming assets have ended the year at only 13 basis points.
Our capital remains quite strong. At year-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.14%. This includes the benefit of 3 successful capital raises during 2020. Mike will touch on these in a moment.
I would note that First Republic does not engage in common share buybacks. As we head into 2021, our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is quite strong. Our pipeline is up from the same time last year. The lower rate environment continued to represent a terrific opportunity for single-family residential purchases and refinance. Single-family residential lending continues to be the primary driver of our growth, representing 2/3 of our loan growth during the year. 
I would note that loan originations have some seasonality, with the fourth quarter typically being quite strong and the first quarter typically being a little bit slower. December was the 10th anniversary of our second IPO, which we did shortly after we bought First Republic Bank back from the BoFA in 2010. During these 10 years, total loans have grown 20% compounded annually, total deposits have grown 20% compounded annually, and total bank assets have grown 20% compounded annually and wealth management assets have grown 28% compounded annually.
Our shareholders have also done well. In 2010, we went public at a price of $25.50 per share. Shareholder value has compounded at 21% per year since that time, including dividends. This is more than 2x the S&P 500 during the same period and nearly 3.5x the KBW Bank Index for the same period. These results reflect our steadfast focus on delivering extraordinary client service, which, in turn, drives consistent organic growth.
Overall, it was a very successful quarter and a very successful full year. Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, our President."
272383,699728255,2249290,"First Republic Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,"Earnings Calls","First Republic Bank","Executives","Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time.

We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more than 600 net new colleagues to the organization and rolled out a number of new benefits to support the well-being of our colleagues. We made more than 4,000 client [indiscernible] loan modifications for our clients impacted by COVID. We delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and nonprofit clients. We did this all while originating a record number of loans. 
Let me now turn to an update on lending. Loan originations for the year, excluding PPP, were $51 billion. Single-family residential volume for the year was a record at $24 billion. Refinance activity, which was particularly robust, accounted for 66% of single-family volume during the year. As we have noted before, refinance continues to be a strong means of acquiring new clients. In terms of credit, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the year was just 55%. 
Turning to business banking. Growth of loans and line commitments was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the Paycheck Protection Program. During the fourth quarter, business line utilization increased to 38%. This is in line with our historical utilization range of mid- to high 30s. 
In terms of funding, it was a record year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, or 28% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Check-in deposits represented 67% of total deposits at year-end. Business deposits represented 57% of total deposits at year-end. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 11 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 31 basis points.
In wealth management, assets grew 29% year-over-year and are now over $194 billion. Well over half of this growth came from net client inflow. Our integrated banking and wealth management model continues to attract very successful wealth managers. During 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed 8 new wealth management teams, including 2 teams in Bellevue, Washington, a key part of the greater Seattle market. We plan to open a preferred banking office in Bellevue later this year to further establish our presence in the market.
As we grow our business safely and organically, we continue to make investments to further reinforce and scale our differentiated service model through an agile tech strategy and continuous process improvements. Our strategy is focused on using technology to enhance human-to-human relationships between clients and our bankers, not to replace them. We are doing this by empowering our bankers with actionable insights and tools to reduce transactional time and maximize emotional time with their clients, and also by rapidly developing and rolling out additional digital capabilities, which allow for a customized and convenient experience for our clients.
2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy. During the year, and in the midst of the pandemic, approximately 70% of our mortgage applications were submitted digitally. We redesigned our corporate mobile app, leading to an increase in active users by more than 40%. We tripled the number of digital deposit account openings. We released one new digital banking feature per week on average. We doubled task automation and gave back 150,000 hours annually to our bankers to further delight their clients. These time savings are equivalent to a 1.5% workforce expansion.
These achievements were enabled by our unique tech strategy, continued operational investments and focus on omnichannel client experience with enhanced connectivity to their trusted bankers. As a result, over the past several years, the number of client households served per banker has increased significantly, while we have maintained our Net Promoter Score consistently double the industry average, as Jim mentioned earlier. 
Overall, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at First Republic, we have successfully navigated a challenging year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Let me review the results for the year and quarter and also offer some guidance for 2021. Our capital position remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we successfully raised $225 million of common stock and completed the redemption of the Series F preferred stock. In total, during 2020, we added over $900 million of net new Tier 1 capital. Liquidity also remains strong, as high-quality liquid assets were 12.8% of average total assets in the fourth quarter. 
Our credit quality remains excellent. Our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $35 million. This provision was driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth. As Jim mentioned, for the entire year, net charge-offs were only $2.4 million, one quarter of 1 basis point of average loans. 
Over this period, we added $157 million to our reserves. We're pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At year-end, COVID modifications totaled only 1.1% of the total portfolio, down from 3.7% on September 30. 
In 2020, loans were up a very strong 22%, excluding PPP. For 2021, loan growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range. Our net interest margin has remained stable at 2.73% for the fourth quarter and 2.72% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%, consistent with current levels. Within this range, our net interest margin may be influenced by higher cash levels as a result of current economic conditions and government stimulus.
Our efficiency ratio was 61.6% for the fourth quarter and 61.9% for the full year 2020. As a reminder, the efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced marketing, travel and events due to the pandemic. For 2021, the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 62% to 64% as we continue to invest in our business and regulatory infrastructure. 
Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%, assuming no change to the corporate tax rate.

The problem on the purchase side is supply, actually, not demand. I would think that the -- 66% of our loan business in single-family this year was refinance. That would probably slow down, and, in fact, we think it may anyway because the rates are already up a little bit. 
We don't worry about a move that will be destructive to the market. Rates -- mortgage rates are going out at the high 2s, low 3s, but mostly high 2s. I don't think the low 3s to the mid-3s slows down purchase finance very much. It does slow down refinance, I think."

Office space is clearly available in the cities we operate in. We can't speak about others, but the cities we operate in, there's, all of a sudden, a bit of an excess of office space. New York is particularly, I think, hit hard. But it's also -- but rental, particularly in new A buildings are finding a rental level that is being signed up, probably down 15% from what it was before. 
The question is, how far down it will ripple in the quality stream from A to B to C properties. And that's not yet clear. Single-family is another matter.

The variability largely, I think, will come from the amount of cash we hold, right? So I think you saw the cash balances up on average a little bit in the fourth quarter.

That usually gives us a larger balance sheet going into the recovery moment, which you're looking at, at this very second. The balance sheet growth this year was unusually strong even for us. And that's a result of a slowdown in competition during the sort of first half of the year, at least, and actually still continuing. And it's not just competition pulling back, it's delivery quality and things of that nature. Our pickup of new households this year is probably a record number, both in absolute and percentage wise.

So we are using a lot of such collaborations to do that as well as internal direct investments into technology to further empower the client and our bankers who are actually making the magic happen. So if you put all that together, the models actually balance itself, and in the markets that we are in, we are -- after so may -- 35-plus years, we still have just about 5% market share.

Your estimate -- I think we had about $4 million of what I'll call extra accretion of the fees in the fourth quarter. There's only $24 million left and that's going to come in over the next couple of quarters. So it supports the margin ever so slightly probably in the first half of the year."

We have been consistently profitable each year for the 35 years since our founding in 1985. 2020 loan origination volume was over $50 billion, a record. Importantly, we were able to fully fund our loan growth with deposit book. Wealth management assets grew more than $43 billion during the year and are now just short of $200 billion. Importantly, the majority of the growth during the year was driven by net client inflows.
This year has proven, once again, the resilience of our high-touch, client-centric service model, both delivered in person and through digital channels. The trusted relationships between our bankers and our clients have proven to be more important than their social proximity. In fact, early results show that our 2020 Net Promoter Score, the measure of our client satisfaction, is at least as high as the prior year. This client satisfaction level is more than twice the banking industry's average and is our growth driver.
Gaye will discuss in a moment how we are further using technology to enhance this client service experience. Our continuing consistent performance under a wide range of economic conditions demonstrates the stability and long-term nature and power of our client service model.
Let me cover a few metrics for the year. Total loans outstanding were up 22%. The total deposits have grown 28%, and wealth management assets increased 29%. This strong growth, in turn, has led to strong financial performance. 
Year-over-year, our revenues grew 17%. Net interest income grew 18%. And the real bottom line, tangible book value per share has increased more than 14% during the year. Most importantly, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Maintaining consistently strong credit in all economic and market environments is a hallmark and a focus of First Republic.
Net charge-offs for the entire year were only $2.4 million, less than 1 single basis points of average loans. During the year, we did add $157 million to our reserves. In the fourth quarter, we actually had net recoveries of $600,000, and nonperforming assets have ended the year at only 13 basis points.
Our capital remains quite strong. At year-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.14%. This includes the benefit of 3 successful capital raises during 2020. Mike will touch on these in a moment.
I would note that First Republic does not engage in common share buybacks. As we head into 2021, our clients remain very active and our loan pipeline is quite strong. Our pipeline is up from the same time last year. The lower rate environment continued to represent a terrific opportunity for single-family residential purchases and refinance. Single-family residential lending continues to be the primary driver of our growth, representing 2/3 of our loan growth during the year. 
I would note that loan originations have some seasonality, with the fourth quarter typically being quite strong and the first quarter typically being a little bit slower. December was the 10th anniversary of our second IPO, which we did shortly after we bought First Republic Bank back from the BoFA in 2010. During these 10 years, total loans have grown 20% compounded annually, total deposits have grown 20% compounded annually, and total bank assets have grown 20% compounded annually and wealth management assets have grown 28% compounded annually.
Our shareholders have also done well. In 2010, we went public at a price of $25.50 per share. Shareholder value has compounded at 21% per year since that time, including dividends. This is more than 2x the S&P 500 during the same period and nearly 3.5x the KBW Bank Index for the same period. These results reflect our steadfast focus on delivering extraordinary client service, which, in turn, drives consistent organic growth.
Overall, it was a very successful quarter and a very successful full year. Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, our President."
272383,699728255,2249297,"First Republic Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,"Earnings Calls","First Republic Bank","Executives","Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more",679,"Thank you, Jim. 2020 was indeed a very successful year for First Republic. We delivered record results, while also supporting our colleagues, clients and communities during this challenging time. For example, in 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed more than 600 net new colleagues to the organization and rolled out a number of new benefits to support the well-being of our colleagues. We made more than 4,000 client [indiscernible] loan modifications for our clients impacted by COVID. We delivered over 11,500 PPP loans to small business and nonprofit clients. We did this all while originating a record number of loans. 
Let me now turn to an update on lending. Loan originations for the year, excluding PPP, were $51 billion. Single-family residential volume for the year was a record at $24 billion. Refinance activity, which was particularly robust, accounted for 66% of single-family volume during the year. As we have noted before, refinance continues to be a strong means of acquiring new clients. In terms of credit, we continue to maintain our conservative underwriting standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the year was just 55%. 
Turning to business banking. Growth of loans and line commitments was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the Paycheck Protection Program. During the fourth quarter, business line utilization increased to 38%. This is in line with our historical utilization range of mid- to high 30s. 
In terms of funding, it was a record year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, or 28% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Check-in deposits represented 67% of total deposits at year-end. Business deposits represented 57% of total deposits at year-end. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 11 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 31 basis points.
In wealth management, assets grew 29% year-over-year and are now over $194 billion. Well over half of this growth came from net client inflow. Our integrated banking and wealth management model continues to attract very successful wealth managers. During 2020, we are pleased to have welcomed 8 new wealth management teams, including 2 teams in Bellevue, Washington, a key part of the greater Seattle market. We plan to open a preferred banking office in Bellevue later this year to further establish our presence in the market.
As we grow our business safely and organically, we continue to make investments to further reinforce and scale our differentiated service model through an agile tech strategy and continuous process improvements. Our strategy is focused on using technology to enhance human-to-human relationships between clients and our bankers, not to replace them. We are doing this by empowering our bankers with actionable insights and tools to reduce transactional time and maximize emotional time with their clients, and also by rapidly developing and rolling out additional digital capabilities, which allow for a customized and convenient experience for our clients.
2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy. During the year, and in the midst of the pandemic, approximately 70% of our mortgage applications were submitted digitally. We redesigned our corporate mobile app, leading to an increase in active users by more than 40%. We tripled the number of digital deposit account openings. We released one new digital banking feature per week on average. We doubled task automation and gave back 150,000 hours annually to our bankers to further delight their clients. These time savings are equivalent to a 1.5% workforce expansion.
These achievements were enabled by our unique tech strategy, continued operational investments and focus on omnichannel client experience with enhanced connectivity to their trusted bankers. As a result, over the past several years, the number of client households served per banker has increased significantly, while we have maintained our Net Promoter Score consistently double the industry average, as Jim mentioned earlier. 
Overall, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at First Republic, we have successfully navigated a challenging year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Let me review the results for the year and quarter and also offer some guidance for 2021. Our capital position remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we successfully raised $225 million of common stock and completed the redemption of the Series F preferred stock. In total, during 2020, we added over $900 million of net new Tier 1 capital. Liquidity also remains strong, as high-quality liquid assets were 12.8% of average total assets in the fourth quarter. 
Our credit quality remains excellent. Our provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $35 million. This provision was driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth. As Jim mentioned, for the entire year, net charge-offs were only $2.4 million, one quarter of 1 basis point of average loans. 
Over this period, we added $157 million to our reserves. We're pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At year-end, COVID modifications totaled only 1.1% of the total portfolio, down from 3.7% on September 30. 
In 2020, loans were up a very strong 22%, excluding PPP. For 2021, loan growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range. Our net interest margin has remained stable at 2.73% for the fourth quarter and 2.72% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, our net interest margin is expected to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%, consistent with current levels. Within this range, our net interest margin may be influenced by higher cash levels as a result of current economic conditions and government stimulus.
Our efficiency ratio was 61.6% for the fourth quarter and 61.9% for the full year 2020. As a reminder, the efficiency ratio has benefited from reduced marketing, travel and events due to the pandemic. For 2021, the efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of 62% to 64% as we continue to invest in our business and regulatory infrastructure. 
Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the full year 2020, in line with our guidance. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%, assuming no change to the corporate tax rate.

Why you will have a rise in rates at the -- you'll have a rise -- a slowdown in refinance. Purchase finance may not slow down all that much because demand is very high. The problem on the purchase side is supply, actually, not demand. I would think that the -- 66% of our loan business in single-family this year was refinance. That would probably slow down, and, in fact, we think it may anyway because the rates are already up a little bit. 
We don't worry about a move that will be destructive to the market. Rates -- mortgage rates are going out at the high 2s, low 3s, but mostly high 2s. I don't think the low 3s to the mid-3s slows down purchase finance very much. It does slow down refinance, I think."

I think that you're right, being just under 62% for the year definitely did benefit from a lack of travel, a lack of in-person client events. My guess is, we're at least 1% higher if you have those items at a normal rate. 
In terms of positive operating leverage, obviously, we're pleased with the year. I do think those costs will start to come back in 2021. And that's probably later in the year, they'll start to come back because of vaccines and people wanting to get out. So I think that's why the range sort of went to 62% to 63% to 64%.
We also are continuing to invest in the franchise. We've talked about on several calls, Hudson Yards coming online this year.,, The core conversion being worked on. And so we're continuing to support the franchise and the way we think that the range is appropriate for next year. And the other side that's important is the margin being relatively stable."

So we're seeing less of a penetration into jumbo market more into the conforming and the 30-year fixed base.

The scarce commodity increasingly is going to be the trusted team and relationships and the customization elements that are going to be harder to find. And that's exactly our First Republic shines. So we see fintechs more partnerships and collaborations that actually decreases transactional time and increases emotional time to allow for further customization. 
So we are using a lot of such collaborations to do that as well as internal direct investments into technology to further empower the client and our bankers who are actually making the magic happen. So if you put all that together, the models actually balance itself, and in the markets that we are in, we are -- after so many -- 35-plus years, we still have just about 5% market share.

We're off to a very strong start in 2021, with terrific growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. First Republic's differentiated business model continues to perform very well.

First Republic's differentiated business model continues to perform very well. In addition to strong earnings, we're quite pleased today to announce a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share per quarter. This is our tenth consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Since 1985, First Republic's success and durability have been grounded in a culture of taking care of each client one at a time, while continuing to operate in a very safe and sound manner. Our long-term steady approach has led to consistent success through a wide variety of environments, including this unprecedented pandemic. 
We are extraordinarily proud of our team's dedication, hard work and commitment to client service and to each other throughout this period. It's been absolutely amazing. A key part of our success is to take great care of our people who, in turn, take great care of the clients. 
We're pleased to have recently increased our company-wide minimum wage to $30 per hour, up from $25, which we instituted in 2018. The unwavering dedication of our clients is also the reason for our latest client satisfaction level as reflected in very strong 2020 Net Promoter Score. 
This strong score once again validates our client service model. Our Net Promoter Score actually improved during the year and remains more than twice the U.S. banking industry average. Client satisfaction among those who identify us as their lead bank is nearly 2.5x the industry average. 
This satisfaction level leads to long-term deep relationships and more referrals, which are the ultimate drivers of our growth. Let me summarize briefly the first quarter results. Total loans outstanding were up 24% year-over-year. Total deposits grew 37% year-over-year. Wealth management assets are up 59% year-over-year, and they now exceed $200 billion. 
This growth across the enterprise drove a very strong financial performance. Total revenue year-over-year has grown 24%. Net interest income is up 25%. And importantly, tangible book value per share increased 14.5% year-over-year. Our strength, safety and soundness continue to be reflected in strong capital, liquidity and credit quality. 
During the first quarter, for instance, we raised an additional $914 million of Tier 1 capital. Our total equity increased 25% year-over-year, supporting our strong growth. We don't engage in share buybacks. 
Strong credit has been for almost 36 years, the core pillar of First Republic and is a key to our strong results and stability. Net charge-offs for this quarter were only $487,000, a fraction of 1 basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 11 basis points of total assets. 
During the first quarter, we did reduce our reserve for credit losses. This is the result of CECL guidelines, leading us to a much improved economic outlook. Plus a substantial resumption of loan payments among our covered modified loans. Mike will discuss this more in a moment. 
Looking to the rest of the year, we are very optimistic. Our clients continue to be very liquid and quite active. Our markets are on a solid path to returning to normal, it would appear, and fiscal and monetary stimulus, as we all know, are very considerable. Overall, it's a great start to 2021, and we are extremely pleased. 
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, President."

It was a terrific quarter that benefited from continued organic growth across the franchise, leading to strong net interest income and wealth management revenues. As Jim mentioned, this is the direct outcome of the exceptional service provided by our caring colleagues and the resulting satisfied and loyal clients. 
Over the past year, while working mostly remotely, our high flight service model has been further strengthened by our continued focus on technology and process improvements. For example, we implemented new digital features that further empower our clients including the ability to connect with their personal banker directly and securely through our mobile app. 
This digital to human service delivery provides greater convenience by allowing our clients to bank in a way that is customized to their needs. Today, more than 3/4 of our clients are using our mobile app. Importantly, our clients know that there is always a trusted human at the heart of their relationship with us, even in the case of our digital experience. 
We are a people-first organization and have always believed that exceptional service starts with our colleagues. With that in mind, we continually do more to support and empower our colleagues so that they can be their best. 
As Jim mentioned, we recently increased our company-wide minimum wage to $30 per hour. We also expanded our health and well-being benefits to support colleagues through this pandemic. And we enhanced our employee home loan program with more than 30% of our colleagues currently participating. 
By taking great care of our colleagues, we are empowering them to deliver unparalleled service to clients. This, in turn, leads to repeat business and more client referrals. Let me now provide some additional comments about the quarter. Loan origination volume was $15.7 billion, our best first quarter ever. 
I would note that the average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the first quarter remained conservative at 55%. Single-family residential volume was $6.9 billion. Refinance accounted for 65% of single-family residential volume during the first quarter. 
The majority of the refinance activity continues to come from clients who formerly had loans at other institutions. Turning to Business Banking. Business loans and line commitments were up 27% year-over-year, excluding PPP loans. The growth in outstanding balances was driven by a utilization rate of 38.5% as well as new commitments. 
During the quarter, we participated in round 2 of the Paycheck Protection Program, helping our small business and nonprofit clients obtain an additional 4,500 PPP loans. Our efforts have provided a much needed lifeline for many during a difficult time. 
Since the program started, we have helped to support over 100,000 jobs. In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 37% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Checking deposits increased by $9.5 billion in the first quarter and now represent over 67% of total deposits. 
Business deposits represented 59% of total deposits, up slightly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 9 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 24 basis points. 
Turning to Wealth Management. Assets under management increased to $219 billion. Since January 1, 2020, assets under management are up 45%, of which fully 60% was net client inflow. During the quarter, we welcomed 3 new Wealth Management teams to First Republic. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality teams. Our first quarter results demonstrate the power of our service culture and the creativity, care and dedication of our colleagues. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

As Jim mentioned, we run the bank with strong credit, capital and liquidity at all times. In the first quarter, we're pleased to have raised $914 million of net new Tier 1 capital, including both preferred and common stock. We issued the Series L preferred stock and redeemed the Series G during the first quarter. 
Following these 2 actions, we expect our quarterly dividend on preferred stock to be approximately $24 million going forward. We also raised $331 million of common equity during the quarter, and as a result, we expect our diluted share count to be approximately $179 million in the second quarter. 
We are very pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At March 31, COVID modifications were down more than 75% from their peak and now represent less than 1% of the bank's total loan portfolio. 
Let me touch on this quarter's provision for credit losses. Historically, the bank increased its loan loss reserve by approximately $20 million to $30 million per quarter as a result of loan growth. This quarter, however, we reduced our reserves by $15 million as the loan growth-related provision was more than offset by 2 positive factors. First was the substantially improved economic outlook since year-end, which largely offset any necessary provision for loan growth. Second was the resumption of regular consistent loan payments following the end of the COVID modification period. 
For some perspective, since we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, we have recorded $142 million of net provisions over 5 quarters, while only recognizing $3 million of net charge-offs. Net interest income was up a very strong 5% from the fourth quarter and 25% year-over-year. This reflects our robust growth in earning assets. 
Our net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.67. This is down from the fourth quarter due to the elevated cash position resulting from our exceptionally strong deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 2.65 to 2.75. 
Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 63.5%. We're very pleased with given the extraordinary revenue growth in the quarter and over the past year, that our expenses have remained in line with revenue growth. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 62% to 64%. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.9%. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a great quarter and a very strong start to the year. And thank you. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

And not to forget strong organic growth across the entire franchise, the NII is what pays the bills the net interest income, and we have been very pleased with the strong growth in that, which offset some fluctuations in NIM."

And the second thing, and this is maybe harder to see is every prediction we made before didn't end up as bad as you thought it might. So the portfolio is just that much stronger. There are a few COVID modifications that have some specific allocated reserves to them, but those are relatively modest in nature from this point going forward. 
And so we would anticipate if we kept growing the portfolio that there likely is some positive amount of reserve that gets recorded in future periods."

And we've gotten, I think, a bit more than our share of that because of the way that we operate and the trust that clients have in us. But nonetheless, as Gaye has said earlier, the average account size of the bank is up. And what we don't know is how much of that is temporary or permanent, we are guessing that a fair amount of it will be spent and thus become economic stimulus, and that's, of course, how the system works.

We look for opportunities we also take into account, first, the lending opportunities for clients, and we want to keep a pretty ALM match book. So we're slightly asset sensitive. So that drives the investment philosophy and the securities portfolio. 
To your point, rising longer-term rates in the quarter allowed us to opportunistically purchase municipal bonds in our investment portfolio, we made about $3 billion purchases, close to 3% TY, just short of it. And it strengthened the NII growth. And given the marginal funding cost, it was right in the -- within the NIM guidance. 
Our liquidity position remains very strong. It's driven to a great extent by the HQLA purchases that you're doing as well as the elevated cash levels. That's why you're seeing a 15.3% HQLA ratio today, which, to some extent, reflects both the purchase and the elevated cash levels. 
So we feel comfortable with 12%, 12.25% and above that, that we're going to be disciplined to keep it above that level."

If you -- again, in our investor deck, but about 80% or more of our lending is either to existing clients every year that are doing more business with us. That's about 50% to 55%. And another 20% to 25% is their direct referrals. 
So to some extent, we march inside of our business and their referrals and not so much in the general market. And that's why our growth rate can be fundamentally different."

In addition to strong e",566,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a very strong start in 2021, with terrific growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. First Republic's differentiated business model continues to perform very well. In addition to strong earnings, we're quite pleased today to announce a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share per quarter. This is our tenth consecutive year of quarterly dividend increases.
Since 1985, First Republic's success and durability have been grounded in a culture of taking care of each client one at a time, while continuing to operate in a very safe and sound manner. Our long-term steady approach has led to consistent success through a wide variety of environments, including this unprecedented pandemic.
We are extraordinarily proud of our team's dedication, hard work and commitment to client service and to each other throughout this period. It's been absolutely amazing. A key part of our success is to take great care of our people who in turn take great care of the clients.
We're pleased to have recently increased our company-wide minimum wage to $30 per hour, up from $25, which we instituted in 2018. The unwavering dedication of our clients is also the reason for our latest client satisfaction level as reflected in very strong 2020 Net Promoter Score. This strong score once again validates our client service model. Our Net Promoter Score actually improved during the year and remains more than twice the U.S. banking industry average. Client satisfaction among those who identify us as their lead bank is nearly 2.5x the industry average. This satisfaction level leads to long-term deep relationships and more referrals, which are the ultimate drivers of our growth.
Let me summarize briefly the first quarter results. Total loans outstanding were up 24% year-over-year. Total deposits grew 37% year-over-year. Wealth management assets are up 59% year-over-year, and they now exceed $200 billion. This growth across the enterprise drove a very strong financial performance. Total revenue year-over-year has grown 24%. Net interest income is up 25%. And importantly, tangible book value per share increased 14.5% year-over-year. Our strength, safety and soundness continue to be reflected in strong capital, liquidity and credit quality.
During the first quarter, for instance, we raised an additional $914 million of Tier 1 capital. Our total equity increased 25% year-over-year, supporting our strong growth. We don't engage in share buybacks.
Strong credit has been for almost 36 years, the core pillar of First Republic and is a key to our strong results and stability. Net charge-offs for this quarter were only $487,000, a fraction of 1 basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 11 basis points of total assets.
During the first quarter, we did reduce our reserve for credit losses. This is the result of CECL guidelines, leading us to a much improved economic outlook plus a substantial resumption of loan payments among our COVID modified loans. Mike will discuss this more in a moment.
Looking to the rest of the year, we are very optimistic. Our clients continue to be very liquid and quite active. Our markets are on a solid path to returning to normal, it would appear, and fiscal and monetary stimulus, as we all know, are very considerable. Overall, it's a great start to 2021, and we are extremely pleased.
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, President."

It was a terrific quarter that benefited from continued organic growth across the franchise, leading to strong net interest income and wealth management revenues. As Jim mentioned, this is the direct outcome of the exceptional service provided by our caring colleagues and the resulting satisfied and loyal clients.
Over the past year, while working mostly remotely, our high-touch service model has been further strengthened by our continued focus on technology and process improvements. For example, we implemented new digital features that further empower our clients including the ability to connect with their personal banker directly and securely through our mobile app. This digital to human service delivery provides greater convenience by allowing our clients to bank in a way that is customized to their needs. Today, more than 3/4 of our clients are using our mobile app. Importantly, our clients know that there is always a trusted human at the heart of their relationship with us, even in the case of our digital experience.
We are a people-first organization and have always believed that our exceptional service starts with our colleagues. With that in mind, we continually do more to support and empower our colleagues so that they can do their best.
As Jim mentioned, we recently increased our company-wide minimum wage to $30 per hour. We also expanded our health and well-being benefits to support colleagues through this pandemic. And we enhanced our employee home loan program with more than 30% of our colleagues currently participating. By taking great care of our colleagues, we are empowering them to deliver unparalleled service to clients. This in turn leads to repeat business and more client referrals.
Let me now provide some additional comments about the quarter. Loan origination volume was $15.7 billion, our best first quarter ever. I would note that the average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the first quarter remained conservative at 55%. Single-family residential volume was $6.9 billion. Refinance accounted for 65% of single-family residential volume during the first quarter. The majority of the refinance activity continues to come from clients who formerly had loans at other institutions.
Turning to business banking. Business loans and line commitments were up 27% year-over-year, excluding PPP loans. The growth in outstanding balances was driven by a utilization rate of 38.5% as well as new commitments.
During the quarter, we participated in round 2 of the Paycheck Protection Program, helping our small business and nonprofit clients obtain an additional 4,500 PPP loans. Our efforts have provided a much needed lifeline for many during a difficult time. Since the program started, we have helped to support over 100,000 jobs.
In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 37% from a year ago. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Checking deposits increased by $9.5 billion in the first quarter and now represent over 67% of total deposits. Business deposits represented 59% of total deposits, up slightly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 9 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 24 basis points.
Turning to wealth management. Assets under management increased to $219 billion. Since January 1, 2020, assets under management are up 45%, of which fully 60% was net client inflow. During the quarter, we welcomed 3 new wealth management teams to First Republic. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality teams.
Our first quarter results demonstrate the power of our service culture and the creativity, care and dedication of our colleagues.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

As Jim mentioned, we run the bank with strong credit, capital and liquidity at all times. In the first quarter, we're pleased to have raised $914 million of net new Tier 1 capital, including both preferred and common stock. We issued the Series L preferred stock and redeemed the Series G during the first quarter. Following these 2 actions, we expect our quarterly dividend on preferred stock to be approximately $24 million going forward. We also raised $331 million of common equity during the quarter, and as a result, we expect our diluted share count to be approximately 179 million in the second quarter.
We are very pleased with the progress of our COVID loan modifications. At March 31, COVID modifications were down more than 75% from their peak and now represent less than 1% of the bank's total loan portfolio.
Let me touch on this quarter's provision for credit losses. Historically, the bank increased its loan loss reserve by approximately $20 million to $30 million per quarter as a result of loan growth. This quarter, however, we reduced our reserves by $15 million as the loan growth-related provision was more than offset by 2 positive factors. First was the substantially improved economic outlook since year-end, which largely offset any necessary provision for loan growth. Second was the resumption of regular consistent loan payments following the end of the COVID modification period.
For some perspective, since we adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, we have recorded $142 million of net provisions over 5 quarters, while only recognizing $3 million of net charge-offs. Net interest income was up a very strong 5% from the fourth quarter and 25% year-over-year. This reflects our robust growth in earning assets. Our net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.67%. This is down from the fourth quarter due to the elevated cash position resulting from our exceptionally strong deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%.
Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 63.5%. We're very pleased with given the extraordinary revenue growth in the quarter and over the past year that our expenses have remained in line with said revenue growth. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 62% to 64%.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.9%. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a great quarter and a very strong start to the year.

And the second thing, and this is maybe harder to see is every prediction we made before didn't end up as bad as we thought it might. So the portfolio is just that much stronger. There are a few COVID modifications that have some specific allocated reserves to them, but those are relatively modest in nature from this point going forward.

There's a very starting of the Hudson Yards expense in the first quarter, just in March, that will start to pick up here in the second half of the year. And then the third one that's maybe not as self-evident is given the revenue growth that you've mentioned, there is a variable nature to a bit of our compensation that's tied to the revenue growth, be it in wealth management fees, the very strong checking growth that we've talked about and loan volume, which year-over-year, I think, is up about 50%.

And we've gotten, I think, a bit more than our share of that because of the way that we operate and the trust that clients have in us. But nonetheless, as Gaye has said earlier, the average account size of the bank is up. And what we don't know is how much of that is temporary or permanent, we are guessing that a fair amount of it will be spent and thus become economic stimulus, and that's, of course, how the system works.
So the last time we've seen anything close to this was a while ago. And in fact, we've never experienced this level of stimulus before. But it will flow out into the economy in due course. So our deposit growth in the future will not be this high."

To your point, rising longer-term rates in the quarter allowed us to opportunistically purchase municipal bonds. In our investment portfolio, we made about $3 billion purchases, close to 3% TY, just short of it. And it strengthened the NII growth. And given the marginal funding cost, it was right in the -- within the NIM guidance.
Our liquidity position remains very strong. It's driven to a great extent by the HQLA purchases that we're doing as well as the elevated cash levels. That's why you're seeing 15.3% HQLA ratio today, which, to some extent, reflects both the purchase and the elevated cash levels. So we feel comfortable with 12%, 12.25% and above that, that we're going to be disciplined to keep it above that level."

So the stimulus, obviously, we talked about the average balance and the median balances being up compared to a year ago, kind of translated through the savings rate in the accounts. So that could basically, to some extent, reverse itself. More competition for funding as rates are going up. But again, as we listen to the Fed Chairman, that it's going to be a while before the short end of the curve coming up. But hypothetically speaking, alternatives whether it's money market, mutual funds or other alternative competition in there, that could also yield to higher costs.
But putting costs aside for a second and the percent checking is much higher than we used to have at over 6% to 7%, so that's kind of driven by the stimulus as well to some extent. So we're not going to have a 37% year-over-year growth, which is kind of driven by stimulus. But at the same time, we have expanded our toolkit so much on the funding side, deposits and beyond, we remain in the A-plus credit on the asset side and the safety and soundness of the bank. The funding has not been an issue, it's just a matter of the pricing, as you point out."

If you -- again, in our investor deck, but about 80% or more of our lending is either to existing clients every year that are doing more business with us. That's about 50% to 55%. And another 20% to 25% is their direct referrals. So to some extent, we march inside of our business and their referrals and not so much in the general market.

It was another very strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets.

It was another very strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. Our client-centric business model is continuing to perform very well across all of our segments and all of our geographic markets. Since 1985, First Republic's success has been grounded in colleague empowerment and a service culture of taking care of each client one at a time while operating in a very safe and sound manner. This straightforward and personal approach has led to very consistent organic growth for 36 years. The growth is not predicated on mergers or acquisitions. 
Let me review for a moment the results of the second quarter. Total loans outstanding were up 18.9% year-to-date annualized. Total deposits have grown 37% year-over-year. Wealth management assets were up 55% year-over-year to a total of more than $240 billion. This across the board, very organic growth drove our strong financial performance. Total revenue year-over-year has grown 34% and net interest income was up 27%. Quite importantly, tangible book value per share increased 15.5% year-over-year. The safety and soundness of the First Republic franchise continues to reflect our strong credit quality. Net charge-offs for the quarter were only $1.2 million, just a fraction of a basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 8 basis points of total assets. 
We remain, as always, focused on capital and liquidity. At quarter end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.05% and our HQLA was 14.3% of total average assets during the second quarter. This included higher-than-normal cash levels. Our clients remain very active as the reopening of our urban coastal markets takes hold. This is particularly evident in the strong growth of single-family home loans during the quarter and so far this year. As represented -- this growth represented a substantial portion of the quarter's total loan activities, including both purchase and refinance. 
For some perspective on the long-term stability of First Republic's model, residential loans have remained steady at approximately 60% of our loan portfolio for the entire past 2 decades. This is a very safe asset class, particularly with our stringent underwriting standards and is a key to us attracting new households. During the second quarter, we opened our first banking offices in Hudson Yards. Clients are responding well to our presence in the area and foot traffic has been actually quite good. Our other new markets, including Palm Beach and Jackson Wyoming, continue to perform very well. Overall, it's been a strong and successful first half of 2021. 
Before turning the call to Gaye, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate her on her appointment as co-CEO. Gaye has been an inviable contributor to our performance, and I'm really delighted to continue our successful partnership at this new level. Working together, we intend to ensure the consistency of First Republic's culture, which is particularly important as we emerge from the pandemic. 
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, Co-CEO and President."

I'm honored to be appointed co-CEO and continue to serve this truly special organization alongside you and our leadership team. We will work hard to keep scaling our people-first culture, with an unwavering focus on safety and soundness and doing more of what we do best, delivering exceptional service to our clients. I'm excited about opportunities ahead and look forward to continue to work with all of our extraordinary colleagues at First Republic. 
Turning to our earnings results, it was a terrific quarter that reflects our continued focus on safe, sound organic growth. Our top priority as an organization is taking care of our exceptional colleagues and empowering them to provide unparalleled client service. Our client satisfaction results in exceptionally low client attrition, which in turn fuels our growth through repeat business and client referrals. Happy people lead to happy clients, and the more happy clients we have, the more repeat business we do and the more client referrals we get. Each year, more than 75% of our safe organic growth comes from these sources. 
Over the past several years, we have continued to make strategic investments in technology and risk infrastructure. These investments allow us to scale our service model, while keeping our bank safe and sound. Our digital and tech investments are geared towards minimizing transactional time to create more time to build further trust and deepen relationships with clients and to serve our communities. 
Let me now provide some additional comments about the quarter. Loan origination volume was $16.8 billion, our best quarter ever. I would note that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the second quarter remained conservative at 58%. Single-family residential volume was $8.7 billion, also a record. Refinance accounted for 49% of single-family residential volume during the second quarter. A large percentage of refinance activity continues to come from clients with loans at other institutions, which provides us with great opportunities for new client acquisition. For perspective, throughout the past 10 years across varying interest rate environment, refinance activity has always accounted for at least 40% of single-family volume. 
Turning to business banking. Business loans and line commitments, excluding PPP loans, were up 27% year-over-year. Capital call outstanding balances were down quarter-over-quarter, driven mainly by a reduction in the utilization rate from 40% to 36%. This is in line with our historic utilization range of mid-30s to low 40s. In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 37% from a year ago, supported by client activity as well as a very meaningful impact from both fiscal and monetary policy. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Checking deposits increased by $5.3 billion in the second quarter and represented 68% of total deposits. Business deposits represented 61% of total deposits, up modestly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 7 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 20 basis points. 
Turning to wealth management, assets under management increased to $241 billion. This is an increase of $46 billion year-to-date, of which more than half was from net client inflows. Year-to-date, wealth management fees were up 39% from the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we welcomed 4 new wealth management teams to First Republic. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality teams. Our second quarter results demonstrate the power of our service model and the dedication of our exceptional colleagues. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, up 34% year-over-year. This was driven by strong organic growth across the franchise, including loans, deposits and wealth management assets. Our net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.68%. This includes the impact of our elevated cash position from fiscal and monetary policy, which has resulted in significant deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%%. Importantly, net interest income was up a very strong 27.5% year-over-year. This is due to the robust growth in earning assets and a stable net interest margin. 
We are pleased with our efficiency ratio, which was 62% for the second quarter. Our expense growth remains proportionate to our revenue growth as we continue to invest in the franchise to deliver outstanding client service. I would note that our 2020 Net Promoter Score actually increased from the prior year. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 62% to 64%. 
Let me talk for a moment about CECL, which has been in place for 6 quarters now. CECL's formulaic guidelines take into account our loan growth, loan mix and historic credit performance. In accordance with CECL, our provision for credit loss during the quarter was $16 million, reflecting our continued loan growth. Since CECL became effective at the start of 2020, we have added $160 million to our reserves, while only experiencing $4 million of losses. 
Turning to the tax rate, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. The decline in the tax rate from the prior quarter was due to increased tax benefits resulting from stock awards vesting during the second quarter. These tax benefits added $0.11 to earnings per share in the second quarter. This compares to $0.03 in the same quarter last year. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a great quarter in the first half of the year. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

So when I look at the average business of account balances versus the average consumer, the average business checking accounts are higher compared to the pre-pandemic levels and consumer is kind of plateauing a bit on the average account balances. So that's also reflecting into that, with the Fed -- and the Fed stimulus is also playing a role obviously, along with the yields in the market. That's also a lot of the business are keeping more cash on the sidelines. But I would reiterate that as part of the model, we follow our private banking clients to their businesses.

So not only do you get the quarterly revenue, but you get a little bit from the, call it, the stub period. If someone joined us February 1, there'll be 5 months of revenue in this quarter versus 3 because we don't bill until you get through the quarter process. And so a little bit of that will happen.

Right now, we have come from the 40s to down to the 36%. The one variable that we always look at it is or metric is the commitment growth. And the PVC activity continues to be strong. So you would expect the momentum in terms of the commitment growth to continue through the second half of the year. And the markets remain very active, very attractive for exits while the fundraising is going all above the pre-pandemic levels as well. So for that reason, I would look at the commitment growth and then still try to expect it to be somewhere between mid-30s to high 30s probably."

That's almost doubled, in fact, from what we were doing before under the student loan refi. And so it's actually the quality of those households is higher than the business.

We do run a very matched book, I think, as Gaye referred to earlier. And so if you look at our simulation models, why rising rate environment is not a particularly threatening thing, the inversion, which you implied in your question, I think, is always a little problematic. But the real problem buried in an inversion is what it does to the economy generally, not so much what it does to us in the short run Inversions don't last very long. So they generally don't mess with our balance sheet very much. 
The other thing that Gaye referred to, which is very important and somewhat unique to us, you have -- almost all banks have repayment rates on their portfolio, CPR. And ours is a little higher than the most for various reasons, the nature of our mortgages primarily. But what they don't have is the growth rate of 15% or so in the portfolio, which adds an additional priced to market of 15% per year, maybe 18% or whatever the growth rate is. And that -- those 2 items together equal 30 -- between 30% and 40% of the balance sheet. So we reprice the balance sheet about 30%, 40% every year from repayments and growth to market.

But -- so operating leverage is not -- it's on the table, but it's not our primary objective. Quality of delivery of service is a primary objective. 
And then we grow and we grow because the clients grow. As Gaye has said, 75% of our growth is driven by our clients or their direct referrals. That's actually not something we're reaching for, that's just coming in. And so we have to respond to it with the level of service that they're used to or expect from us will have a diminishing franchise and that we never intend to have.

And I think our philosophy remains similar as it has. we were pleased the first quarter to raise some capital at attractive pricing. We keep an eye on the market. We think about what our future opportunity to serve clients and grow is. And then we remain opportunistic when appropriate. And I think that philosophy has been here 36 years, I think, and will continue into the future. And it's as much a view of our outlook of future growth as anything, because we always want to fund that sort of in advance as we think about the future."

It was another very strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. Our client-centric business model is continuing to perform very well across all of our segments and all of",500,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It was another very strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. Our client-centric business model is continuing to perform very well across all of our segments and all of our geographic markets. Since 1985, First Republic's success has been grounded in colleague empowerment and a service culture of taking care of each client one at a time while operating in a very safe and sound manner. This straightforward and personal approach has led to a very consistent organic growth for 36 years. The growth is not predicated on mergers or acquisitions.  
Let me review for a moment the results of the second quarter. Total loans outstanding were up 18.9% year-to-date annualized. Total deposits have grown 37% year-over-year. Wealth management assets were up 55% year-over-year to a total of more than $240 billion. This across-the-board, very organic growth drove our strong financial performance. Total revenue year-over-year has grown 34% and net interest income was up 27%. Quite importantly, tangible book value per share increased 15.5% year-over-year. The safety and soundness of the First Republic franchise continues to reflect our strong credit quality. Net charge-offs for the quarter were only $1.2 million, just a fraction of a basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 8 basis points of total assets.  
We remain, as always, focused on capital and liquidity. At quarter end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.05% and our HQLA was 14.3% of total average assets during the second quarter. This included higher-than-normal cash levels. Our clients remain very active as the reopening of our urban coastal markets takes hold. This is particularly evident in the strong growth of single-family home loans during the quarter and so far this year. As represented -- this growth represented a substantial portion of the quarter's total loan activities, including both purchase and refinance.  
For some perspective on the long-term stability of First Republic's service model, residential loans have remained steady at approximately 60% of our loan portfolio for the entire past 2 decades. This is a very safe asset class, particularly with our stringent underwriting standards and is a key to us attracting new households. During the second quarter, we opened our first banking offices in Hudson Yards. Clients are responding well to our presence in the area and foot traffic has been actually quite good. Our other new markets, including Palm Beach and Jackson Wyoming, continue to perform very well. Overall, it's been a strong and successful first half of 2021.  
Before turning the call to Gaye, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate her on her appointment as co-CEO. Gaye has been an inviable contributor to our performance, and I'm really delighted to continue our successful partnership at this new level. Working together, we intend to ensure the consistency of First Republic's culture, which is particularly important as we emerge from the pandemic.  
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, Co-CEO and President."

I'm honored to be appointed co-CEO and continue to serve this truly special organization alongside you and our leadership team. We will work hard to keep scaling our people-first culture, with an unwavering focus on safety and soundness and doing more of what we do best, delivering exceptional service to our clients. I'm excited about opportunities ahead and look forward to continue to work with all of our extraordinary colleagues at First Republic.  
Turning to our earnings results, it was a terrific quarter that reflects our continued focus on safe, sound, organic growth. Our top priority as an organization is taking care of our exceptional colleagues and empowering them to provide unparalleled client service. Our client satisfaction results and exceptionally low client attrition, which in turn fuels our growth through repeat business and client referrals. Happy people lead to happy clients, and the more happy clients we have, the more repeat business we do and the more client referrals we get. Each year, more than 75% of our safe organic growth comes from these sources.  
Over the past several years, we have continued to make strategic investments in technology and risk infrastructure. These investments allow us to scale our service model, while keeping our bank safe and sound. Our digital and tech investments are geared towards minimizing transactional time to create more time to build further trust and deepen relationships with clients and to serve our communities.  
Let me now provide some additional comments about the quarter. Loan origination volume was $16.8 billion, our best quarter ever. I would note that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the second quarter remained conservative at 58%. Single-family residential volume was $8.7 billion, also a record. Refinance accounted for 49% of single-family residential volume during the second quarter. A large percentage of refinance activity continues to come from clients with loans at other institutions, which provides us with great opportunities for new client acquisition. For perspective, throughout the past 10 years across varying interest rate environments, refinance activity has always accounted for at least 40% of single-family volume.  
Turning to business banking. Business loans and line commitments, excluding PPP loans, were up 27% year-over-year. Capital call outstanding balances were down quarter-over-quarter, driven mainly by a reduction in the utilization rate from 40% to 36%. This is in line with our historic utilization range of mid-30s to low 40s.  
In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 37% from a year ago, supported by client activity as well as a very meaningful impact from both fiscal and monetary policy. We continue to maintain a diversified deposit funding base. Checking deposits increased by $5.3 billion in the second quarter and represented 68% of total deposits. Business deposits represented 61% of total deposits, up modestly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 7 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 20 basis points.
Turning to wealth management, assets under management increased to $241 billion. This is an increase of $46 billion year-to-date, of which more than half was from net client inflows. Year-to-date, wealth management fees were up 39% from the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we welcomed 4 new wealth management teams to First Republic. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality teams. Our second quarter results demonstrate the power of our service model and the dedication of our exceptional colleagues.  
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, up 34% year-over-year. This was driven by strong organic growth across the franchise, including loans, deposits and wealth management assets. Our net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.68%. This includes the impact of our elevated cash position from fiscal and monetary policy, which has resulted in significant deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 2.65% to 2.75%. Importantly, net interest income was up a very strong 27.5% year-over-year. This is due to the robust growth in earning assets and a stable net interest margin. We are pleased with our efficiency ratio, which was 62% for the second quarter. Our expense growth remains proportionate to our revenue growth as we continue to invest in the franchise to deliver outstanding client service. 
I would note that our 2020 Net Promoter Score actually increased from the prior year. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 62% to 64%.  
Let me talk for a moment about CECL, which has been in place for 6 quarters now. CECL's formulaic guidelines take into account our loan growth, loan mix and historic credit performance. In accordance with CECL, our provision for credit loss during the quarter was $16 million, reflecting our continued loan growth. Since CECL became effective at the start of 2020, we have added $160 million to our reserves, while only experiencing $4 million of losses.  
Turning to the tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. The decline in the tax rate from the prior quarter was due to increased tax benefits resulting from stock awards vesting during the second quarter. These tax benefits added $0.11 to earnings per share in the second quarter. This compares to $0.03 in the same quarter last year. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a great quarter in the first half of the year.  
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

If someone joined us February 1, there'll be 5 months of revenue in this quarter versus 3 because we don't bill until you get through the quarter process. And so a little bit of that will happen.

We do run a very matched book, I think, as Gaye referred to earlier. And so if you look at our simulation models, why rising rate environment is not a particularly threatening thing. The inversion, which you implied in your question, I think, is always a little problematic. But the real problem buried in an inversion is what it does to the economy generally, not so much what it does to us in the short run. Inversions don't last very long. So they generally don't mess with our balance sheet very much. 
The other thing that Gaye referred to, which is very important and somewhat unique to us, you have -- almost all banks have repayment rates on their portfolio, CPR. And ours is a little higher than the most for various reasons, the nature of our mortgages, primarily. But what they don't have is the growth rate of 15% or so in the portfolio, which adds an additional price to market of 15% per year, maybe 18% or whatever the growth rate is. And that -- those 2 items, together, equal 30 -- between 30% and 40% of the balance sheet. So we reprice the balance sheet about 30%, 40% every year from repayments and growth to market.

And on the government and agency HQLA which, again, Jim referred earlier to ALM matching from a duration management perspective, we have been doing some short-term barbell strategies there as well. The short-term agency HQLA is coming in around 75 bps and the traditional agency HQLA is around 1.5% to 2%. 
So all in all, we're seeing the additional marginal assets coming in, in the high 2s, more around the real estate assets coming in, in the 2.95% type of range, with a marginal funding cost about 20 basis points. And you put in the elevated cash levels, so that brings us to the lower half of the 2.65%, 2.75% as we have printed this quarter."

And that other institutions don't have that revenue growth or revenue production. And so we're always supporting how do you deliver client service while continuing to grow. And that has led to what we think is a very stable efficiency ratio in a pretty tight range while improving our Net Promoter Score, expanding offices like Hudson Yards was mentioned earlier to deliver client service. 
And so I think we think more about it that revenue growth and expense growth are relatively matched in terms of how they're growing. And so it may not be positive operating leverage that you mentioned, but it leads to a consistency and stability over a long period of time. And I think we view that as very important."

So operating leverage can be achieved by cost cutting, which others do. We're not in that game. We're in this for the long haul. It's a very long game. And so our approach has always been to maintain, as Mike just said so clearly, a balance of operating costs and invest continually in operating systems and procedures so that we have good backup and safety embedded. But -- so operating leverage is not -- it's on the table, but it's not our primary objective. Quality of delivery of service is a primary objective. 
And then we grow, and we grow because the clients grow. As Gaye has said, 75% of our growth is driven by our clients or their direct referrals. That's actually not something we're reaching for, that's just coming in. And so we have to respond to it with the level of service that they're used to or expect from us, or we'll have a diminishing franchise, and that we never intend to have. So what we value, above all else, is stability, the predictability and stability of the model. And that's a balance, that's a continual balance.

It was another strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. First Republic's unique simple client-centric business model continues to perform very well across all of our segments and our markets. Since 1985, First Republic's success has been grounded in a culture of exceptional service, taking care of each client 1 at a time, serving our existing clients exceptionally well. Nothing has changed. It is a story of straightforward execution of our model, which results in consistent compounding organic growth year after year. This quarter was not an exception. 
Let me review briefly the results for the third quarter. Total loans outstanding were up 18.8% year-to-date annualized. Total deposits have grown 39% year-over-year. Wealth management assets were up 50% year-over-year to a total of more than $250 billion. This across-the-board organic growth drove our very strong financial performance for the quarter. Year-over-year, total revenue has grown 30%. Net interest income was up 27%. And quite importantly, tangible book value per share increased almost 19%. The safety and soundness of the bank continues to reflect very strong credit quality. Net charge-offs for the quarter were only $292,000, that's a fraction of a basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 7 basis points of total assets. As always, we're very focused on capital and liquidity.
During the third quarter, we raised $1.2 billion of new Tier 1 capital to support our continued growth. This included common equity as well as our Series M perpetual preferred stock, which was issued at our lowest dividend rate ever actually 4%. At quarter-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.55%. Our HQLA liquidity level at quarter-end was 16.7% of total average assets. This included very strong cash levels. We continue to be focused on strengthening our communities as we have been for 36 years. For example, this month, we participated in a capital raise for the supportive housing fund managed by SBA's Capital Group. These funds will be used to address the almost challenge in California by providing additional permanent housing. Our participation in this initiative is only a modest part of our long-term focus on investing and strengthening our communities. Overall, 2021 so far has been a strong and successful year.
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Arkon, Co-CEO and President."

The simplicity of our business model allows us to deliver consistent performance quarter after quarter, while remaining acutely focused on the long-term success of the franchise. Our strong performance supports further investments in the delivery and scalability of our client service model. For example, we continue to invest in our colleagues, new talent and operational infrastructure to support our growth. New preferred banking offices to deepen our presence in our existing markets and technology and digital enablement to further empower our colleagues and reinforce our trusted client relationships.
Let me now provide some additional detail on this quarter's performance. Loan origination volume was very strong at $15.5 billion, up meaningfully from a year ago. This is our best third quarter ever. Single-family origination volume was strong at $7 billion. Single family continues to be a key driver of our growth representing more than 75% of our year-to-date loan growth. I would note that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of single-family originations year-to-date was just 59%. Refinance accounted for 53% of single-family residential volume during the quarter. A large proportion of refinance activity continues to come from clients with loans at other institutions, providing us with great opportunities for new client acquisition. We continue to maintain our stringent underwriting standards. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the third quarter remained conservative at 56%, slightly lower than the prior quarter. 
Turning to business banking. Business loans and line commitments, excluding PPP loans, were up 31% year-over-year. Capital outstanding balances increased during the quarter, reflecting growth in commitments as well as an increased utilization rate of 37.3%. In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 39% from a year ago. At quarter-end, checking deposits represented 69% of total deposits. Business deposits represented 62% of total deposits, up slightly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 6 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 17 basis points.
Turning to wealth management. Assets under management increased to $252 billion. This is an increase of $57 billion year-to-date, over 60% of which was from net client inflows. Year-to-date, wealth management fees were up 47% from the same period a year ago. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality wealth management teams to First Republic. In total, we have welcomed 9 new teams year-to-date. This includes 1 team in the third quarter and another team already this quarter. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the power of our service model and the ongoing dedication and care of our amazing colleagues.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, up 30% year-over-year. This was driven by strong organic growth across the franchise, including loans, deposits and wealth management assets.
Our net interest margin for the third quarter was 2.65%. This reflects the impact of our elevated cash position from fiscal monetary policy, which has resulted in significant deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in our previously communicated range of 2.65% to 2.75%. Importantly, Net interest income was up a very strong 27% year-over-year. This is due to the robust growth in earning assets.
Let me now provide a brief update on our core banking system conversion. We're very pleased with the progress of our core conversion and are in the final phase of delivery. We now expect to complete the conversion in the first quarter of 2022. This extension of one quarter will give us time for additional in-person testing and training that has been delayed due to the COVID-19 delta variant. I would note that our efficiency ratio guidance for the full year 2021 remains unchanged at 62% to 64%. For the quarter, our provision for credit losses was $34 million, which is reflective of our strong loan growth. As Jim noted earlier, we are particularly pleased with our Series M preferred stock offering in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our preferred stock dividend will be approximately $33 million. 
Turning to the tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.4%. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a strong quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

As Jim mentioned, our model continues to benefit from the liquidity and the activity in the market. This is reflected in the higher account balances. Half of the increase in the business deposits, we have seen driven by increased average account balances with our existing well-known clients. And we have also seen very strong client activity and continued referrals. So for example, our business households were up over 20% year-over-year. And with regards to AUM, S&P 500 was up 28% year-over-year. So our AUM does reflect the strong stock market as well as quite strong client inflows from both existing as well as new clients, as you mentioned earlier.

And then the second, in terms of wage inflation, I mean the one thing I would highlight is, we did recently increase our minimum wage to $30 for colleagues -- for all colleagues across the bank. And so we think that's a great step for our colleagues. And I think we have been hiring, and it is very competitive from a hiring standpoint. And so I don't think it's necessarily meaningful, but we have seen a little bit more competition for new hires and some of that does come down to wages."

On the commercial real estate front, as you know, as it's smaller deals, we don't do large loans. And that's mostly focused on either multiuse or office type of buildings, but on the smaller scale and Class A buildings.

We do as many good deals as we are exposed to opportunistically. But I would take you back to our investor deck, where about 80% or 85% of our business and over 60% is done with existing clients and 85% roughly is done with existing clients and their direct referrals. That activity does not really reflect a lot of volatility. The refinance component of it has some volatility in it. But those clients are there, they're doing, they're active. The economy is quite active, and they will bring their business to us at the pace at which they bring it to us. And we will compete for it. And in most cases, we'll win it. When you have a Net Promoter Score of over 70, you tend to win the business with your existing clients or their referrals. And that's the backbone of the model. And so it's not as nearly as much a market condition-driven model as it is a client need and demand model. And right this moment, our clients are very active. In terms of rising rate or tapering, if you want to, let me just comment on this and then turn it to Gaye for maybe additional comments. But because we grow, we have -- between the growth volume, which remind you -- maybe it's intrinsic in this, but to state the obvious, new volume was always priced at current market. And so if you have new volume and you put it together with variable rate loans, repayments, you've got about 52% of our assets or our loan book is repriced in the year, over half. So if you look back at the company in rising rate environments, we've done just fine."

Single-family residential has been the majority of the driver, and it's diversified with a lot with the known clients refinance activity has remained largely above 40% of our single-family originations given that majority of that comes from clients with loans at other institutions and a great acquisition tool. So that stays pretty much steady across different rate cycles. And with tapering potentially curve steepness if that were to be the case, would also be helpful. And in a rising rate environment, the balance sheet growth safe, mostly with known existing clients, known credit, that's in mid-teens plus the repayment that we are seeing, even though it slows a bit, it still continues, plus the floating rate assets. So over 50% of our loaning portfolio reprices over time, which is great."

It was another strong quarter with robust growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. First Republic's unique simple client-centric business model continues to perform very well across all of our segments and our markets. Since 1985, First Republic's success has been grounded in a culture of exceptional service, taking care of each client one at a time, serving our existing clients exceptionally well. Nothing has changed. 
It is a story of straightforward execution of our model, which results in consistent compounding organic growth year after year. This quarter was not an exception.  
Let me review briefly the results for the third quarter. Total loans outstanding were up 18.8% year-to-date annualized. Total deposits have grown 39% year-over-year. Wealth management assets were up 50% year-over-year to a total of more than $250 billion. This across-the-board organic growth drove our very strong financial performance for the quarter. Year-over-year, total revenue has grown 30%. Net interest income was up 27%. And quite importantly, tangible book value per share increased almost 19%. The safety and soundness of the bank continues to reflect very strong credit quality. Net charge-offs for the quarter were only $292,000, that's a fraction of a basis point. Nonperforming assets at quarter end were only 7 basis points of total assets. As always, we're very focused on capital and liquidity. 
During the third quarter, we raised $1.2 billion of new Tier 1 capital to support our continued growth. This included common equity as well as our Series M Perpetual Preferred Stock, which was issued at our lowest dividend rate ever actually 4%. At quarter-end, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.55%. Our HQLA liquidity level at quarter-end was 16.7% of total average assets. This included very strong cash levels. 
We continue to be focused on strengthening our communities as we have been for 36 years. For example, this month, we participated in a capital raise for the support of housing fund managed by SDS Capital Group. These funds will be used to address the homelessness challenge in California by providing additional permanent housing. Our participation in this initiative is a -- only a modest part of our long-term focus on investing and strengthening our communities. Overall, 2021 so far has been a strong and successful year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, Co-CEO and President."

The simplicity of our business model allows us to deliver consistent performance quarter after quarter, while remaining acutely focused on the long-term success of the franchise. Our strong performance supports further investments in the delivery and scalability of our client service model. For example, we continue to invest in our colleagues, new talent and operational infrastructure to support our growth. New preferred banking offices to deepen our presence in our existing markets and technology and digital enablement to further empower our colleagues and reinforce our trusted client relationships. 
Let me now provide some additional detail on this quarter's performance. Loan origination volume was very strong at $15.5 billion, up meaningfully from a year ago. This is our best third quarter ever. Single-family origination volume was strong at $7 billion. Single family continues to be a key driver of our growth representing more than 75% of our year-to-date loan growth. I would note that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of single-family originations year-to-date was just 59%. Refinance accounted for 53% of single-family residential volume during the quarter. A large proportion of refinance activity continues to come from clients with loans at other institutions, providing us with great opportunities for new client acquisition. 
We continue to maintain our stringent underwriting standards. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all real estate loans originated during the third quarter remained conservative at 56%, slightly lower than the prior quarter.  
Turning to business banking. Business loans and line commitments, excluding PPP loans, were up 31% year-over-year. Capital call outstanding balances increased during the quarter, reflecting growth in commitments as well as an increased utilization rate of 37.3%. In terms of funding, it was an exceptional quarter. Total deposits were up 39% from a year ago. At quarter-end, checking deposits represented 69% of total deposits. Business deposits represented 62% of total deposits, up slightly from the prior quarter. The average rate paid on all deposits for the quarter was just 6 basis points, leading to a total funding cost of 17 basis points. 
Turning to wealth management. Assets under management increased to $252 billion. This is an increase of $57 billion year-to-date, over 60% of which was from net client inflows. Year-to-date, wealth management fees were up 47% from the same period a year ago. The strength of our integrated model continues to attract very high-quality wealth management teams to First Republic. In total, we have welcomed 9 new teams year-to-date. This includes 1 team in the third quarter and another team already this quarter. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the power of our service model and the ongoing dedication and care of our amazing colleagues. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer."

Revenue growth for the quarter was exceptional, up 30% year-over-year. This was driven by strong organic growth across the franchise, including loans, deposits and wealth management assets. 
Our net interest margin for the third quarter was 2.65%. This reflects the impact of our elevated cash position from fiscal and monetary policy, which has resulted in significant deposit growth. We continue to expect our net interest margin for the full year 2021 to be in our previously communicated range of 2.65% to 2.75%. Importantly, net interest income was up a very strong 27% year-over-year. This is due to the robust growth in earning assets. 
Let me now provide a brief update on our core banking system conversion. We're very pleased with the progress of our core conversion and are in the final phase of delivery. We now expect to complete the conversion in the first quarter of 2022. This extension of one quarter will give us time for additional in-person testing and training that has been delayed due to the COVID-19 Delta variant. I would note that our efficiency ratio guidance for the full year 2021 remains unchanged at 62% to 64%. For the quarter, our provision for credit losses was $34 million, which is reflective of our strong loan growth. 
As Jim noted earlier, we are particularly pleased with our Series M Preferred Stock offering in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our preferred stock dividend will be approximately $33 million.  Turning to the tax rate, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.4%. Under current tax law, we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Overall, this was a strong quarter.

And we're -- and things are going up very nicely in the stock market and in deposits and loans. And we're benefiting from all of the liquidity in the system and a rising equity market. So it's very important to take that into account, too. And let me turn this over to Gaye for some more detail."

As Jim mentioned, our model continues to benefit from the liquidity and the activity in the market. This is reflected in the higher account balances. Half of the increase in the business deposits, we have seen driven by increased average account balances with our existing well-known clients. And we have also seen very strong client activity and continued referrals. So for example, our business households were up over 20% year-over-year. And with regards to AUM, S&P 500 was up 28% year-over-year. So our AUM does reflect the strong stock market as well as quite strong client inflows from both existing as well as new clients, as you mentioned earlier. So the model continues to perform nicely and benefit from what's going on in the market."

We do as many good deals as we are exposed to opportunistically. But I would take you back to our investor deck, where about 80% or 85% of our business and over 60% is done with existing clients and 85% roughly is done with existing clients and their direct referrals. That activity does not really reflect a lot of volatility. The refinance component of it has some volatility in it. But those clients are there, they're doing, they're active. The economy is quite active, and they will bring their business to us at the pace at which they bring it to us. 
And we will compete for it and in most cases, we'll win it. When you have a Net Promoter Score of over 70, you tend to win the business with your existing clients or their referrals. And that's the backbone of the model. And so it's not as nearly as much a market condition-driven model as it is a client need and demand model. And right this moment, our clients are very active. In terms of rising rate or tapering, if you want to, let me just comment on this and then turn it to Gaye for maybe additional comments. But because we grow, we have -- between the growth volume, which remind you -- maybe it's intrinsic in this, but to state the obvious, new volume was always priced at current market. And so if you have new volume and you put it together with variable rate loans, repayments, you've got about 52% of our assets or our loan book is repriced in the year, over half. So if you look back at the company in rising rate environments, we've done just fine."

Single-family residential has been the majority of the driver, and it's diversified with a lot -- with the known clients and refinance activity has remained largely above 40% of our single-family originations given that majority of that comes from clients with loans at other institutions and a great acquisition tool. So that stays pretty much steady across different rate cycles. And with tapering potentially curve steepness if that were to be the case, would also be helpful. And in a rising rate environment, the balance sheet growth safe, mostly with known existing clients, known credit, that's in mid-teens plus the repayment that we are seeing, even though it slows a bit, it still continues, plus the floating rate assets. So over 50% of our loaning portfolio reprices over time, which is great."

And then on the muni side, we did do some purchase on munis, and that at high 2s, low 3s on TEY. So the new money yields to summarize is coming around 2.90% with a marginal funding cost at about 15, 20 basis points and then you add on the elevated cash levels that brings you to the lower end of our guidance to 2.65% to 2.75% guidance."

And part of that, I know there was a question about wage inflation, but what's really driving the increase in salaries is the growth from production. And so you're seeing increases in assets under management, increase in deposits. There is an expense associated with that from an incentive standpoint that's matching pretty well with the growth in revenues, which is really over a long horizon is probably more of our focus than squeezing the last dollar out, right?
