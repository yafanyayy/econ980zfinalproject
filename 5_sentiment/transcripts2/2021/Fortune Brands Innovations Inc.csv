I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe. I could not be prouder of what we achieved in 2020. Our strong fourth quarter results capped a remarkable full year performance by our teams. Facing unprecedented challenges, we drove market-beating growth and delivered on our margin expansion strategy ahead of schedule. 
During the year, we deployed over $1 billion in capital towards M&A, share buybacks and dividends, generated excellent free cash flow and exited the year with attractive leverage. And amidst all of this activity, our teams worked tirelessly to keep consumers and customers supplied while maintaining industry-leading safety performance and has truly been an extraordinary year. All of our businesses saw impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. And we drove margin improvement in each segment by delivering against strong demand for our leading brands and leveraging our efficiency programs. 
Importantly, this past year, we also made critical long-term investments in our brands, innovation, Fortune Brands' core capabilities and supply chain capacity that will enable us to capture future opportunities and accelerate our share gains. 
Over the last 8 quarters, we have shown that we can deliver results and create value for our stakeholders in a variety of market conditions. We are positioned to capture growth as the market accelerates, and are structured to tightly manage our P&L in times of slower expansion. With the initiatives that we've undertaken, the investments that we have made, and momentum that we are seeing, we expect even stronger sales and profit growth as we enter 2021. 
Looking forward, we are in the early stages of a long-term expansion of U.S. housing. As has been widely noted, the extent to which U.S. housing has been underbuilt is several multiples greater than the of the mid-2000s. And yet, new construction starts are far short of their peak and only now reaching historic averages. Low supply and high demand, coupled with favorable demographics and low interest rates have unleashed delayed momentum into our marketplace. Given the long inventory of housing, this momentum impacts both new construction, and repair and remodel activity as the aging housing supply requires renovation. Given supply side constraints, we expect this momentum to play out over several years. 
Turning to 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of this expanding housing market. We've done a lot to replatform the business to be even more efficient and agile and will continue to do more in the year ahead. While economic and pandemic uncertainties still exist, we will stay flexible and nimble and manage the business very tightly. We expect to capture increasing opportunities in this market and have scenario planned for challenges that could arise. 
The last 8 quarters have demonstrated that we can excel in playing offense and defense and can deliver for shareholders in a variety of market environments. We are well positioned and are very excited for the year ahead. 
I want to thank all of our dedicated team members who continue to work so hard to keep our people safe and our facilities operating. I am so proud of our teams, who are not only caring for each other, but who are doing so while serving strong demand for home products. Our people are the foundation upon which our business is built, and they drove our outstanding results in 2020. 
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the Home Products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our fourth quarter and full year results as well as discuss our key initiatives and how we expect to evolve over term. And then Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity, as well as our thoughts around our future financial performance expectations for 2021. 
Now turning to our view on the housing market. As I've mentioned, long-term fundamentals continue to be very favorable for housing and home products. U.S. housing is currently substantially underbuilt, and we are uniquely positioned with our brands and channels to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity. Additionally, the key millennial generation has accelerated their delayed move towards household formation and are showing increased interest in homeownership. Pandemic or no epidemic, this generation's move towards household formation had to happen as they form families who we simply lack the housing stock to support it. Moreover, increased workplace flexibility has allowed many younger homeowners to leverage technology, aligned for larger homes further from urban course. Multifunctional spaces within the home as well as increased trends towards entertaining at home and outdoor living are accelerating new home buying and remodeling. 
New construction activity has remained strong since the latter half of 2019, except during a brief COVID shutdown driven by very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates, and is showing no signs of slowing down. The strength of our new construction channel gives us exposure to excellent growth as builders work to meet the significant demand. Repair and remodel activity remains very strong as consumers continue their focus on home improvement and spending to refurbish older homes. With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventory is being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. Additionally, with home values on the rise, as well as homeowner balance sheet strength, and home equity levels at or near all-time highs, we expect robust on our activity through 2021 and beyond. We believe our advantage mix of exposure to the stable repair and remodel market, combined with the torque of a strong new construction market gives us an unparalleled opportunity to add long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Given current market fundamentals, including very favorable demographics, low inventory and an aged housing stock, we see a very positive multiyear tailwind powering the U.S. housing market to consistent mid-single-digit R&R growth and high single-digit single-family new construction growth, which could be even higher in the near term. Consistent with our long history, we intend to outperform any market conditions that materialize. 
As we have demonstrated over the last 2 years, our ability to capture the upside afforded by new construction exposure, as well as effectively manage periods of softer demand and for when market conditions change, uniquely positions us to drive both growth and margins with a portfolio of leading brands and advantaged channel positions. 
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total sales increased approximately 13% over last year, and operating margin increased to 14.8%. This performance was the result of exceptional operational execution in a strong market, while our teams continue to serve robust demand. We drove solid margin improvement as we saw the continued benefit of our efficiency programs implemented in early 2020.  Consistent with our strategy, our fuel for growth program allowed us to invest heavily in key growth initiatives, including the Moen brand, innovation, decking capacity and distribution rollout, and value-priced cabinetry capacity. We also continue to invest in replatforming our business through advantaged Fortune Brands' common core competencies, including complexity reduction, category management and global supply chain management. We are accelerating investments in our most critical priorities as we position for continued growth in 2021 and for the longer term. 
Importantly, these cost company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule as reflected in our 2020 results, and will continue to compound in 2021 and beyond. We will continue to drive a common set of capabilities to fuel growth and drive margin expansion. 
Now let me turn to our individual businesses, and how we are positioning to be even stronger long term. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets, with sales up mid-teens in the quarter, had operating margins of 21.8%. We experienced strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Plumbing investments in marketing and innovation continue to fuel remarkable results. Our Global Plumbing Group's ability to pursue growth in both core and adjacencies is creating new opportunities for this business to continue producing market-leading growth. Our sustained investment in brand, newer channels such as e-commerce as well as an on-trend innovation sets GPG up for continued long-term success. 
We also achieved solid growth in China during the fourth quarter. Moen continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, driving excellent leverage to the bottom line. In China, housing continues to be an important overall component of economic growth and the Chinese economy. 
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased double digits and operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 15.8%. These exceptional results were driven by double-digit decking and doors growth a return to growth in security and strong segment operating performance. Importantly, our Fiberon decking brand continued to grow in excess of 30%, and notwithstanding the lapping of product load-ins ahead of distribution gains in Q4 of 2019. Decking momentum continues to benefit from our distribution wins and execution as we position the brand for long-term growth in a market fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials. 
The pandemic has accelerated consumers' focus on outdoor living, and we are seeing continued strong demand for our products. Our distribution wins and capacity expansion plans remain on track. We had incremental capacity come online in the fourth quarter and will expand further at multiple points in time throughout 2021. 
To further capture the momentum in outdoor living and leverage opportunities as the market leader in exterior door products, we added LARSON to our Outdoors and Security business. LARSON is the market leader in and security doors, and is a perfect fit with our exterior door products and outdoor living portfolio of leading brands. It is a high-performing business with a phenomenal team and best-in-class products and customer relationships. We're off to a great start with LARSON and are excited to accelerate value creation with advantage to Fortune Brands' core competencies in synergistic portfolio. 
Sales in our legacy Doors brands experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity from distribution wins. The synergies and scale emerging from our shared wholesale distribution for doors and decking has been particularly advantageous to 2020 share gains. 
Turning to Security. Sales returned to growth with retail producing double-digit growth and commercial markets remain soft as the sales channel remained largely closed. We are continuing to innovate in our security product lines with touchless and connected products for residential and commercial applications and feel good about the progress that the business is making under its new leadership. 
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales increased low double digits with growth across product lines at all price points, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points over last year to 11.6%. This past year, the business has demonstrated how our pivot plan has worked, producing outperformance across vastly different market environments and in extremely challenging conditions. After more than 2 years of aggressive repositioning, this business is now squarely centered on the heart of the market and has proven it can achieve and sustain share gains with leverage through the P&L, producing higher margins. The make-to-order market has returned to solid growth with the stabilization of imports and the rise in home sales and remodeling activity. The streamlining of our make-to-order business is now delivering, and we are being rewarded with incremental business from our vantage dealer network. We continue to further optimize the supply chain to prepare for growth at higher margins over the next few years. 
Regarding our value price point cabinets, we continue to gain share from both domestic players and from the absence of Chinese suppliers, who've exited the market over the past few months or who've been replaced to a lesser extent, with other importers with higher costs and longer lead times. Our advantage low-cost country supply chain is competing and winning against domestic competitors and higher costing imports. Our Cabinets team has succeeded in repositioning products to win in the market and has improved the cost structure of the business. More opportunities lie ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same aggressiveness and tenacity demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid-teens margins. 
In summary, 2020 was an unprecedented year that has reshaped many facets of our society. And also shown a bright light on the value of the home and the role it plays in people's lives. We're proud to work towards our purpose of fulfilling dreams of home, now more than ever. Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and lower supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for housing. With our excellent teams, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are perfectly positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders. 
As we continue to outperform the strong home products market, we are accelerating our journey to improve operating margins and are ahead of schedule. While the immediate economic outlook and pandemic environment remain uncertain, and supply chains and cost inflation may introduce some volatility, we have proven our ability to perform in a variety of market conditions. We will continue to operate the business with focus and agility while investing in key strategic initiatives to deliver excellent long-term results for stakeholders. Our teams yet again delivered excellent results in a challenging environment. We remain focused on keeping our people safe and serving our customers. We're investing for the long-term and continue to demonstrate that this business model and management team have multiple pods to increasing growth and profitability. We're excited to be in the early innings of a multiyear expansion in U.S. housing. While we are far from prior peaks and housing activity, our business has grown stronger and has more scale than at any prior time in its history. As the market expands to full the much-needed demand for U.S. housing, we expect to scale with demand and continue to take share, consistent with our track record. Our portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market is more innovative and has broader channel exposure than ever. Combined with our own actions to continuously improve the business and our proven resilience, we are uniquely positioned to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion, while managing any volatility that may come our way. 
Our 2021 outlook, which Pat will speak to in greater detail, reflects the strength of our business, with robust growth translated to excellent profit leverage, while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond. 
In addition, our balance sheet is strong and positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for our world-class brands and people can accomplish. With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"

And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year",1680,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $246 million, up 19% or $40 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 70 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.25 for the quarter, up 25% versus $1 for the same quarter last year. Our associates focused on safety and on serving our customers during challenging circumstances made these remarkable results possible. Our teams used the circumstances of 2020 to enhance focus, improving share competitiveness and cost efficiency, driving 2020 growth and accelerating our margin improvement trajectory, providing an excellent 2021 setup. 
Our Advantage business model with leading brands and channel positions allowed us to navigate 2020's uncertainties to outperform the markets in which we operate. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $638 million, up $89 million or 16% or up 15% adjusting for FX. Fourth quarter growth was strong double digits across all major products, channels and geographies. Full year 2020 sales were up almost 9% versus 2019. Plumbing operating income increased 17% to $139 million for the current quarter. Operating income for the full year was $490 million, an increase of 12% over 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.8% and over 22% for the full year. Our Global Plumbing Group concluded its fifth straight year of strong growth and margin performance. Our strategies are clearly working, and we expect another strong year for Plumbing in 2021. 
Now turning to Outdoors and Security. Sales for the fourth quarter were $367 million, up $35 million or 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Doors and Decking, and a return to growth in Security. Full year 2020 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of over 5% versus the prior year. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth, with particular strength continuing in Doors and Decking. Door sales were up double digits in the fourth quarter, driven by strong retail POS and accelerating single-family new construction. We expect sales growth to continue in 2021 as both retail and new construction remains strong. 
Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. We added incremental capacity during the quarter and more capacity will come online in 2021. The secular trends favoring composite decking remain as strong as ever. 
Security sales returned to growth in the quarter with retail products growing double digits, while commercial products and markets remained soft due to COVID 19. 
Outdoors and Securities segment operating income was $58 million during the quarter, up 17% over the same quarter last year, driven by operating improvement in Doors and Decking. Operating income for the full year was $205 million, an increase of approximately 16% versus 2019. Segment operating margin for Outdoors and Security increased 90 basis points for the quarter, over last year to 15.8% and was 14.5% for the full year, up 130 basis points versus 2019. 
Turning to cabinets. Sales for the fourth quarter were $656 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2019. Full year 2020 sales were $2.5 billion, up 3.4%. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to growth this quarter, a positive signal for big ticket R&R and reflective of the stabilization of imports and consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $76 million, up 27% or $16 million versus the prior year, and full year operating income was $256 million, up 11% or $26 million versus 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 11.6% and 10.4% for the full year, up 150 and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. Full year Cabinet's margin performance was very strong, given big ticket R&R, inclusive of Cabinets, experienced the most severe demand and operating impacts during the second quarter COVID shutdown. We are very pleased with Cabinet's second half margin performance of 11.9% and strong year-end exit rate. We expect Cabinets' operating margin improvement to continue in 2021, as we build on our efforts in 2020 to further enact operational efficiencies and aggressively leverage our market-leading growth. 
For FBHS as a whole, to sum up our full year consolidated 2020 performance, sales increased approximately 6% to over $6 billion for the first time ever as a public company. EPS grew over 16% to $4.19, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement by outperforming the markets in which we operate in an increasingly efficient manner. Our total company operating margin was up 80 basis points to 14.1%, ahead of our full year 2020 plan. 
Free cash flow was $742 million, reflecting a conversion rate of 126%. 2021 profit growth will benefit from the efficiency programs initiated in 2020 and the continuation of a strong U.S. housing market. This will result in positive operating leverage across the company as we continue to enact Fortune Brands' core capabilities across the portfolio. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on expected signs of material and cost inflation in the face of current elevated demand and amid a backdrop of a fundamentally strong housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our business. We do this through continuous cost improvement within our operations, having enacted major improvements just within the past year. We also employ cost-sharing with suppliers where appropriate and continuously look for ways to add flexibility and durability to our global supply chain.  Finally, when necessary, we act via pricing. Through this combination of actions, we expect to navigate 2021 inflation and achieve our margin improvement objectives. We will mitigate, offset and overcome inflationary headwinds and and deliver our goals of market beating growth and continued margin expansion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $419 million, net debt of $2.2 billion and our net-debt-to-EBITDA leverage ended the year at 2.1x or slightly below 2x on a pro forma basis, inclusive of LARSON EBITDA. We now have $865 million of total liquidity available between our $1.25 billion revolver and supplemental $400 million revolver. We have the ability to make investments and deploy capital to accelerate growth and shareholder value creation and are assessing opportunities to do so. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through targeted buybacks and our dividend. 
Turning to the details of our outlook for 2021. Based on the global market for our products growing 5% to 7%, with the U.S. housing market also growing 5% to 7%, and within this market forecast, we expect U.S. new construction growth of 10% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 4% to 6%. Based on those assumptions, we expect 2021 full year sales growth of 12.5% to 14.5% or 5.5% to 7.5%, excluding LARSON. We expect full year EPS within the range of $4.85 to $5.05 on a before-charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to 18% EPS growth versus 2020. 
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan. Plumbing net sales growth of 7% to 9%, with operating margins of 22 plus percent. Outdoors and Security net sales growth of 35% to 37% or 5% to 7% ex-LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14% to 15%, or approximately 15% to 16%, adjusting for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses. Cabinets net sales growth of 5% to 7% with operating margins of 11% to 12%. 
We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $600 million to $650 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $92 million to $93 million; interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million; a tax rate between 24.5% and 25%; average fully diluted shares of approximately $140 million to $141 million. 
To summarize, we have put together a 2021 plan that provides solid sales and excellent EPS growth, while we continue to accelerate investments in brand, innovation and Advantage Fortune Brands capabilities. Potential exists for upside to our plan and guidance if some combination of the following occurs. Labor is available to address in full the strong expected U.S. new construction and big ticket R&R demand; if U.S. R&R growth improves beyond the 4% to 6% assumed in our plan; government stimulus increases materially beyond programs currently in place without impacting interest rates. Better insight to these opportunities will unfold during the first half. As this occurs and as merited, we will refine our guidance accordingly. We expect a long runway of fundamental U.S. housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. With market growth averaging 5-plus percent per year over the next few years, assuming the current level of unemployment continues to stabilize, and improves, we expect our sales to continue outperforming the market and our margin progression to remain accelerated, averaging improvement above 50 basis points in 2021 in each of the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our balance sheet strength supports capital deployment and while we delivered over $1 billion in M&A, share repurchases and dividends in 2020, we are still advantageously positioned to assess further opportunities to deploy capital. We see multiple paths to value creation to execute for our shareholders, and our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. 
Our teams remain committed to driving market-leading sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.

We do, as we fold LARSON into the business, we have some purchase accounting and some integration costs. So our reported margin might be closer to 14.5% for the year. But we expect over '20 and '21 combined to achieve 150 basis points of total margin improvement we've been talking about for a while.

I'll just add that if you step back a little bit, we set out as a team to really accelerate the flywheel within the business. So investing in core capabilities across the entire platform to generate fuel for growth with the intention that a portion of that would be seen through margin accretion, and a portion of that would be generated to incrementally invest in the business to drive more top line. And once the pandemic hit, we really used it as a platform to accelerate our plans and are delighted with how we've emerged. 
Basically, probably about a year ahead of schedule from where we thought we were. But having made far more incremental investments in the business in 2020 than I think we would have expected at the outset of the year, with plans to continue that in '21 and beyond. And so this flywheel really is is working now. And you'll see it through our organic margin, as Pat described, but also through our investment profile as we continue to invest in brand, in innovation, in capacity and in capability in the business."

And I guess when we do think about the out years then and that 50 basis points or so of margin expansion that you expect each year.

I think that will be driven by the amount of growth you see, because the growth gives you some pretty powerful leverage. And then the pace at which you're able to drive the cost improvement and pricing necessary to offset inflation. I do think we go into '21, eyes wide open that we'll have inflation on multiple fronts, material, logistics and labor, but we'll manage it effectively as we have managed considerable tariff inflation the last 3 years. And so I don't think we lie awake at night on inflation or think that, that's going to hold us back. In fact, we're committed to drive the margin improvement through that inflation. But I think there will be multiple episodes and some of the timing of that will unfold as we pursue the next couple of years."

So, let me take that, and then I'll hand it to Pat to give a little bit more color, but I'll tell you, I mean, firstly, hats off to our team to be able to kind of deliver these quarters of growth, because you're right, it does stretch capacity. And when you drill down and look in pockets of the business where it really was surgery and people working literally around the clock to make it happen. And so we have been stretched. I think the feedback from customers is more pleased, but they've been very satisfied with the fact that I think we stayed a step ahead of the competition. And that has really helped fuel our share gains, because we've been reliable through this period. Notwithstanding the fact that it's taken a lot of work. And so we're working hard. And as we built out the plan for '21, we hypersensitized, I would say, to both an upside scenario and a downside scenario. So downside scenario, we're ready to manage the P&L very, very tightly, manage expenses very, very tightly to deliver the kind of margin progression that we were just talking about there with Sue. But we've sensitized on the upside as well, and to the extent that there's upside, we're leaning into capacity investments and inventory to be able to serve the market and capture that upside. The housing market is undeniably strong. And we don't just view this as a a pocket of strength. I mean you go all the way back to the fundamentals. They support this and this expansion is going to have to go on for a long time in order to support it, because we're just fundamentally underbuilt in U.S. housing, and there might be bumps along the way. But over time, this will play out very strongly. And so therefore, we have confidence in leaning in towards that capacity and the capacity investment in inventory, because we know that the market needs it. Any color you want to add?"

And I mean, you're looking at something like 5 years now just consistent market outperformance at increasing margins. And so really phenomenal performance to put up 16 -- in excess of 16% growth in the quarter, just to get into capacity. I mean, just the ability to do that alone is impressive, but we're feeling really good about it, Phil. I mean, firstly, it's been going on for a long time now, right? It's not kind of this one-off. It's been going on for a long time. It was -- as your question, it was really strong across the board. As you know, retail was very strong, in particular, throughout the year. But as the wholesale channel opened back up, we did see it start to pick up momentum, and we saw that momentum accelerate. And by the time we got to the end of the year, we saw healthy growth in every part of that business barn on. I mean, it's rare that you gets to say that, that it was just everywhere, but it really was everywhere. And hard to service it, whether it be in retail and e-com, in wholesale or in China. The other exciting thing you asked, is there room to go. I mean, notwithstanding the fact that the business is able to do that and the business delivered margin in excess of 22%, it also upped its incremental investment significantly. So investment in brand was up almost $15 million year-on-year, $10 million in the quarter. I mean, that's significant investments in packaging refresh, investments in capabilities like e-commerce and operations as well as things like supply chain around head count. In our DCs airfreight to meet a customer demand. And so really putting an investment that sets the business up to continue to grow. And as you step away from that, what do you have, you have this brand that we're investing behind, which is just absolutely refreshed and peaking. Consumers love it. It's #1 for purchase intent. And so we feel really strongly about that. We've invested in the channel and our supply chain capacity. And so we're there to serve. And then we're building out these new adjacencies, these future cores of the business and those are starting to really gain traction. And we're seeing it in areas like the smart home, where you've seen the products done things like Club. We just won a CES Best of Innovation Winner for you Smart Faucet. We won some recognition at CES with the U.S.A. Today's Editor's choice on our flood smart pump, some pump monitor, which we just launched. What's really exciting about is when you start to tie all that stuff together, what you'll start to see in 2021 is that we're really building out that whole smart home ecosystem. And all of these elements are going to start to talk to each other and be able to do water conservation, freeze protection, vacation modes. And so when you pose that question, do we see room to go, I would say, absolutely. We're performing really well in the core of faucets and showerheads. But the business has gotten so good at just leveraging, it's kind of twin assets of brand and and channel strength to build out these adjacencies. 
I think you'll see some near-in adjacencies that will perform in the near-term and then really building out future cores with some of these further out adjacencies that are really starting to gain traction. So we're feeling great. The business has been great under leadership. And I think given the investments that were made '20 is really just poised to keep doing what it's doing and even see some acceleration from here."

Is there a way that we can think about what we might expect to see or what you all are expecting to see in terms of the sequential trajectory as you progress from 1Q through into the back half of FY '21?

I think what we could say is, obviously, from our results, the fourth quarter finished very strongly, right? We delivered double-digit growth across all the lines of business. And you saw that in POS as much as you saw in shipments. We're still kind of in a mode where we're largely shipping to POS at this point. And I think that will continue through a good part of the first quarter to half of the year. And the POS momentum from the fourth quarter has largely carried into the opening month of this year and doesn't seem to be abating. So we would definitely expect double-digit growth for the first quarter at least, and that could easily continue into the second quarter given last year you were shut down for at least about half of the quarter. And then we'll see where it goes from there. I think when we look at understanding a market and setting guidance for the full year, you see some pretty wide goalpost on external data for U.S. R&R and U.S. new construction. As you noticed, we come out on, but I think the bullish side of it because we think that this is underpinned by fundamental demographics and other drivers of the macro that are not just episodic here. And so we'll see if the back half of the year is kind of flat to low single-digit growth or it gets a lot better. I think there's a good chance that it gets better than that. But I kind of guide you towards double-digit growth to start the year, and then we'll update you as appropriately. We don't typically give quarterly guidance, but I think what we're seeing this early part of the year is the same POS strength we saw at the end of the year."

And so those are sort of proper comps. So to kind of put up the growth that we put out and seen the POS that we saw in Q4 gives us a good degree of confidence. The fact that we've carried that momentum, that exit momentum right into what we're seeing now in January, makes us feel pretty good that there's a very solid market there on top of solid comps from the prior year."

I wanted to -- second question I had relates to the Cabinets business specifically. We think of it as primarily kitchen and bath cabinetry and yet, 1 of the interesting things with the pandemic and the working from home is that people, I'm guessing, that certain population and probably one that you can cater to well would be considering maybe converting rooms to more permanent work-from-home space as opposed to something ad hoc and just throwing it together, getting something from IKEA. And in that regard, I'm wondering how much of your business in the Cabinet segment has historically been outside of Kitchen and Bath, and I'm thinking it would probably be primarily home-office type setups. And where do you think that can go?"

We don't sort of track it by -- tightly by rooms outside of Kitchen and Bath. But what I will say is the team there is very -- has actually been very focused on adjacencies and areas for growth as part of their strategic plan. But it's also being absolutely prioritized about the way in which they're going to go after things, right? So first and foremost, is kind of dedication to the margin journey that we're on and making sure that we are absolutely able to hit that. And again, you see the exit rate here for Q4 and even the exit rate that Pat referenced for the second half at 11.9%. We're very satisfied with how they're tracking. And they're not satisfied, though, to sit on that. They're working very hard to say what's what's the journey time, the team's objective and even beyond it. So that's our priority #1. 
Priority #2 is capturing the share from the imports. And they've done a phenomenal job of that. And if you look at the imports, while some of that has flowed back, it is at a much higher AUP than was previously, right? So less volume, higher price. That's absolutely the landscape in which we want to compete, which is an even playing field. And so we're competing there and winning. And then from there, I'd say it's new channels and new products. And so new channels, there's a lot of opportunity in e-commerce. We're starting to see that come to fruition and investing behind the opportunity there. And then adjacencies. So areas like other rooms. Is there expansion beyond the kitchen where other areas or other vanities. And so that's the order of priority. I'd say that they're attacking these things. And we'll get off of them. And I think as we do, you're going to see both the margin progression that we're absolutely committed to delivering, but also because of what you touched on as well as some of the other areas, I've touched on, there'll be some really nice growth as well."

And if you -- the way we kind of put it together, starting from the very strong performance in this year. Decking, as I said, in excess of 30% in Q4. And again, a real lap there, right, because you had product load-ins ahead of the distribution gains in Q4 of '19. And then we're seeing really, really strong performance in Doors as well. I would say on the Decking side, we've got a capacity plan, and we're kind of working through our capacity plan and then we will try to work an upside plan for that capacity plan to the extent that we're able to bring that upside plan to fruition or see more pricing momentum on Decking, which I think that sector probably merits. There's some upside there. 
And then I think in Doors, there may well be certainly, if the momentum that we're seeing continues, and it's really both wholesale and retail. So it's not just new construction part, but in retail as well. Then we would see it there as well. We were somewhat cautious as we built the plan around just the strength of what we saw towards the end of the year, both in Doors and in our LARSON acquisition. And so we want to kind of progress through the first quarter, and see how that's going. But again, the momentum in both of those businesses, like we touched on Plumbing and Cabinets has continued to be very strong and has maintained its velocity coming out the back end of the year. And so I don't disagree with you. I think we put together a prudent plan, and we are still cognizant of the fact that there is pandemic and economic uncertainty out in the world, and we want to manage the P&L very tightly. But we're gearing the business and the capacity to the upside there. And I think you touched on a couple of areas in which it could happen. 
And then just turning to your question on Security. I fully agree with you. We would like to see more growth now. You had a couple of things, a couple of dynamics in the year, you had on the retail side of business, you had back-to-school season that just didn't happen, right? We saw a lot of locker locks and things like that. And you had a commercial channel where we go in, really into a consultative sale with factories and facilities that shut down in Q2 and stayed shutdown throughout the rest of the year. We actually exited the fourth quarter with really nice growth in retail in the double digits. And so we were really encouraged by that. And where we got the business squarely focused is on getting the product assortment right, getting the supply chain absolutely set, getting the category management capabilities in and once all that is set, and we made some really good progress and invested for it in 2020, then we're going to start to turn the dial harder on things like innovation, which should then start to raise the top line. 
And so we wanted to be very deliberate about that progression, getting that core right, getting the operations and supply chain absolutely stable and healthy and producing, and then kind of turning them to growth. Although even given that, we were happy to see retail, which is the biggest part of the business, power along as it did at the end of the quarter."

I think there is potential upside to both Doors and Decking, I think in Decking, the hit on it. It's the pace of our capacity plan and the pricing dynamics in the marketplace, those things could lend upside if they go faster than we are expecting. And then Doors, think of the Doors business is probably the 1 business we have that's closer to 50-50 new construction in R&R as opposed to most of our portfolio about 2/3 or more R&R. And as you recall, our outlook on U.S. new construction is 10% to 12%, I think there's upside to Doors to the extent that builders can pace completions closer to their order flow. Our market outlook is really predicated on about 100,000 unit growth in U.S. housing, but that's about 110 to 100 of -- I'm sorry, that's 100 to 110 of new construction -- single-family new construction housing growth and a decline in multifamily for a total of about 75,000 units across the two. So I think it really gets down to kind of the pacing of completions in single-family pickup, and that will help drive that business. 
And then to Nick's point on Security is can we get a real back-to-school season? Can we get the industrial markets opened up as consultants are allowed in factories and get innovation going in that business? Those are the things."

And just wanted to circle back to a prior question around cadence throughout the year and very much appreciate the talk around the top line, where you're seeing double-digit top line growth likely to continue into the first quarter, possibly the second. It sounded like by contrast, just again at this point of the year, and obviously, the way the numbers would work, flat to up low single digits, which is still very impressive, obviously, given the tough comps and I think most people would be some -- many people would be thinking perhaps it would be down a little bit. So I just want to make sure I heard that right that at this point in the game, as you look at your plans, you're looking for flat to maybe up slightly in the back half? And what that means for EPS distribution. Typically, during the year, you have anywhere from -- 40% to 45% or so of EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 55%, 60% in the back half. I would almost think this year that would flip. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that."

But I would say, firstly, just kind of step back from a market perspective, we're very fortunate. The 2 most favorable housing markets in the world, the U.S. and China markets, right? And that's where you see the most growth and the most opportunity. And China is sort of the rare market that is not only growing quickly, but also is quite fragmented. And so there's still an opportunity to build a lot of share over time. And our business there has been built organically over a long time with a homegrown team that has out-executed that market and now is very focused not on just out executing the top line, but driving profit and driving leverage through the P&L. As much just as good discipline to be able to reinvest in the business for the long run, as a profit driver for us overall, it's really more -- we want that business to be disciplined and to be healthy and be able to to continue to drive itself. And so they've grown incredibly quickly, and the focus has really been on leveraging our brand and channel position into new product adjacencies and new channel adjacencies. And I think they do it better than anybody in our business. They really kind of are our North Star for the rest of Fortune Brands in their approach. When you look at the more recent performance, it's continued to power on. We obviously saw the shutdown around Chinese new year and then continue on. As you know, the Chinese economy actually did pretty well, grew a bit over 2% for the year. So pretty impressive. And we're calculating or basing sort of somewhere between 6, maybe a bit more. Where we continue to see strength throughout the year was really in the developer side of the business and in the e-commerce side of the business. Showrooms were slower as people were still cautious to head out. But we have a leading share in developer, so we were very excited about that, and developers continue to build. And bear in mind, we're really prioritized on Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. So we're not really exposed to the big speculative buildings and the empty cities that you hear about. We're not really big share in Shanghai and other densely populated areas where people are either moving in or upgrading their living circumstances. And so we're very bullish on the opportunity in China. Housing continues to be a fundamentally important part of that country's economy, and so we don't see that backing down. And then within housing, we're out executing, and we're out executing with a homegrown team that really knows how to build out the Moen brand and the House of Roll brands into even broader adjacencies and how to build out new channels and new channel partners. 
And while we've been doing this, actually in 2020, we raised our, let's say, an incremental investment in that business and really started loading the pull behind the brands, not just the push model that we've done really well with over time. And the early read on the brand metrics have been extremely strong. And so we're very excited about China. We think over the long term, it could be a really nice play for our company. We don't to bank on it in any given year, but we've just grown it slowly -- or not so slowly, but I'd say, over a long period of time, to the point where now it's a significant player in that market and can be a significant growth contributor for us."

I think if there's 1 part of our business, and Nick hit on it, that's probably driving innovation at the most rapid pace and with the greatest level of success, including into adjacent categories and finding growth across multiple channels and doing it profitably in that market as well. It's just a -- the talent on the ground we have there is ever bit as strong as the talent we have across the globe, and they're doing an amazing job."

Recall, firstly, we never counted on government assistance to help us. We set about pivoting the portfolio to really aim at the heart of that market like what was working there anyway, and adjusted our portfolio to really target that heart of the market. But then we were successful in the anti-dumping suit. And the purpose of that really was to get rid of illegal subsidies and unfair composition. It wasn't to close the board and all imports. And we're happy to import -- we're happy to compete against other low-cost countries, and we feel not only we set up to compete, we're set up to win. And I think that's what's now playing out. And so as you've seen, those imports start to migrate to other countries. And by the way, a lot of that is illegal transshipping. And I think customs is going to be all over that. But you're seeing it come across at a higher cost, either because it truly is manufactured in another country. So average selling price out of Vietnam is more than 2x what the China AUP is or it's being illegally transshipped, but frankly, moving stuff from 1 country to another and trying to evade customs has a cost to it. That's being reflected in the marketplace. And so I'm sure you're seeing it through your channel checks, but you go to the channel checks. You'll hear that imports are still struggling from a supply chain perspective, lead times are long and pricing is up. And that is a very favorable backdrop for which -- for us to compete. And that's why it's 1 of the reasons why we're not seeing growth across the board, even though you could argue on a dollar perspective, those imports are kind of probably at a dollar level where they were prior to the run-up of inventory with the duties coming on. 
The playing field is level and the business is competing well. And the only outcome we could have hoped for. And again, not trying to shut a Board, we're just trying to have a level playing field. And it's had the necessary impact. We will, however, continue to aggressively investigate or or help pursue anybody who cheats and there's going to be cheating happening, but it happens with enough incremental cost, but I think it's leveled out the playing field enough. Pat, you want to touch on the margin?"

And so if you really look at the back half margin of that business, which is 11 9, I think it's more indicative of kind of where they're running at these days. And you hit out 1 of the levers to kind of get this farther up the margin chain and more towards that mid teens. I think there's room to go on both the stock and the make-to-order side of the businesses. We'll deal with inflation in our cabinet business as we do in all of our businesses. We'll take continuous cost improvement and supply chain actions that were necessary price to drive improvement offsets inflation. And then I think getting leveraged to get further margin expansion, there's still a lot of growth on the asset and SG&A base and stock and also, I would say, during '20, we were repurposing some older capacity on the fly and still are in the early parts of this year, that is not the optimal way to service demand. We're doing that just because the demand is so strong. 
So there's still some footprint optimization to go in the stock business. And then I think we did a lot of hard work to standardize product and rightsize the semi-custom and premium make-to-order businesses. A, there's still some more standardization opportunity out there. And all the hard work to rightsize those businesses, and now that those businesses are growing. You're going to see in '21 and beyond, the ability to leverage the tough restructuring work that the teams have been doing for the 2 years in that business. So I think you're going to see both stock and make-to-order contributing to growth from this point forward. 
I think what you haven't seen and really until the back half of this year is on the stock side. You still had so many things moving to service demand. You weren't seeing the optimal long-term cost structure for the stock side, and you were still seeing decline in make-to-order. And it's only now that we're seeing the stock gets closer to its end game, and we're seeing growth in make-to-order to leverage that resized business. 
So I think there's good opportunity ahead for both of them. And we're wide eyed to the competition. As Nick said, we built a better mousetrap. We're not looking for the government to give that business margin and that business is demonstrating that it can compete for share and turn it into margin accretion."

I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe. I could not be prouder of what we achieved in 2020, our strong fourth quarter results capped a remarkable full year performance by our teams. Facing unprecedented challenges, we drove market-beating growth and delivered on our margin expansion strategy ahead of schedule.
During the year, we deployed over $1 billion in capital towards M&A, share buybacks and dividends, generated excellent free cash flow and exited the year with attractive leverage. And amidst all of this activity, our teams worked tirelessly to keep consumers and customers supplied while maintaining industry-leading safety performance and has truly been an extraordinary year. 
All of our businesses saw impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. And we drove margin improvement in each segment by delivering against strong demand for our leading brands and leveraging our efficiency programs. Importantly, this past year, we also made critical long-term investments in our brands, innovation, Fortune Brands' core capabilities and supply chain capacity that will enable us to capture future opportunities and accelerate our share gains.
Over the last 8 quarters, we have shown that we can deliver results and create value for our stakeholders in a variety of market conditions. We are positioned to capture growth as the market accelerates and are structured to tightly manage our P&L in times of slower expansion. With the initiatives that we've undertaken, the investments that we have made, and momentum that we are seeing, we expect even stronger sales and profit growth as we enter 2021.
Looking forward, we are in the early stages of a long-term expansion of U.S. housing. As has been widely noted, the extent to which U.S. housing has been underbuilt is several multiples greater than the overbuilding of the mid-2000s. And yet, new construction starts are far short of their peak and only now reaching historic averages. Low supply and high demand, coupled with favorable demographics and low interest rates have unleashed delayed momentum into our marketplace. Given the lower inventory of housing, this momentum impacts both new construction and repair and remodel activity as the aging housing supply requires renovation. Given supply side constraints, we expect this momentum to play out over several years.
Turning to 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of this expanding housing market. We've done a lot to replatform the business, to be even more efficient and agile and will continue to do more in the year ahead. While economic and pandemic uncertainties still exist, we will stay flexible and nimble and manage the business very tightly. We expect to capture increasing opportunities in this market and have scenario planned for challenges that could arise.
The last 8 quarters have demonstrated that we can excel in playing offense and defense and can deliver for shareholders in a variety of market environments. We are well positioned and are very excited for the year ahead.
I want to thank all of our dedicated team members who continue to work so hard to keep our people safe and our facilities operating. I am so proud of our teams, who are not only caring for each other, but who are doing so while serving strong demand for home products. Our people are the foundation upon which our business is built, and they drove our outstanding results in 2020.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our fourth quarter and full year results as well as discuss our key initiatives and how we expect to evolve over term. And then Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as our thoughts around our future financial performance expectations for 2021. 
Now turning to our view on the housing market. As I've mentioned, long-term fundamentals continue to be very favorable for housing and home products. U.S. housing is currently substantially underbuilt, and we are uniquely positioned with our brands and channels to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity.
Additionally, the key millennial generation has accelerated their delayed move towards household formation and are showing increased interest in homeownership. Pandemic or no epidemic, this generation's move towards household formation had to happen as they form families and we simply lack the housing stock to support it. Moreover, increased workplace flexibility has allowed many younger homeowners to leverage technology aligned for larger homes further from urban course. Multifunctional spaces within the home as well as increased trends towards entertaining at home and outdoor living are accelerating new home buying and remodeling.
New construction activity has remained strong since the latter half of 2019, except during a brief COVID shutdown driven by very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates, and is showing no signs of slowing down. The strength of our new construction channel gives us exposure to excellent growth as builders work to meet the significant demand. 
Repair and remodel activity remains very strong as consumers continue their focus on home improvement and spending to refurbish older homes. With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventory is being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. Additionally, with home values on the rise as well as homeowner balance sheet strength and home equity levels at or near all-time highs, we expect robust on our activity through 2021 and beyond. We believe our advantage mix of exposure to the stable repair and remodel market, combined with the torque of a strong new construction market gives us an unparalleled opportunity to add long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Given current market fundamentals, including very favorable demographics, low inventory and an aged housing stock, we see a very positive multiyear tailwind powering the U.S. housing market to consistent mid-single-digit R&R growth and high single-digit single-family new construction growth, which could be even higher in the near term. Consistent with our long history, we intend to outperform any market conditions that materialize.
As we have demonstrated over the last 2 years, our ability to capture the upside afforded by new construction exposure as well as effectively manage periods of softer demand and for when market conditions change, uniquely positions us to drive both growth and margins with a portfolio of leading brands and advantaged channel positions.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total sales increased approximately 13% over last year, and operating margin increased to 14.8%. This performance was the result of exceptional operational execution in a strong market, while our teams continue to serve robust demand. We drove solid margin improvement as we saw the continued benefit of our efficiency programs implemented in early 2020.
Consistent with our strategy, our fuel for growth program allowed us to invest heavily in key growth initiatives, including the Moen brand, innovation, decking capacity and distribution rollout and value-priced cabinetry capacity. We also continue to invest in replatforming our business through advantaged Fortune Brands' common core competencies, including complexity reduction, category management and global supply chain management. We are accelerating investments in our most critical priorities as we position for continued growth in 2021 and for the longer term.
Importantly, these cost company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule as reflected in our 2020 results, and will continue to compound in 2021 and beyond. We will continue to drive a common set of capabilities to fuel growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses, and how we are positioning to be even stronger long term. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets, with sales up mid-teens in the quarter and operating margins of 21.8%. We experienced strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Plumbing investments in marketing and innovation continue to fuel remarkable results. Our Global Plumbing Group's ability to pursue growth in both core and adjacencies is creating new opportunities for this business to continue producing market-leading growth. Our sustained investment in brand, newer channels such as e-commerce as well as an on-trend innovation sets GPG up for continued long-term success.
We also achieved solid growth in China during the fourth quarter. Moen continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, driving excellent leverage to the bottom line. In China, housing continues to be an important overall component of economic growth and the Chinese economy.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased double digits and operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 15.8%. These exceptional results were driven by double-digit decking and doors growth, a return to growth in security and strong segment operating performance. Importantly, our Fiberon decking brand continued to grow in excess of 30%, notwithstanding the lapping of product load-ins ahead of distribution gains in Q4 of 2019. Decking momentum continues to benefit from our distribution wins and execution as we position the brand for long-term growth in a market fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials.
The pandemic has accelerated consumers' focus on outdoor living, and we are seeing continued strong demand for our products. Our distribution wins and capacity expansion plans remain on track. We had incremental capacity come online in the fourth quarter and will expand further at multiple points in time throughout 2021.
To further capture the momentum in outdoor living and leverage opportunities as the market leader in exterior door products, we added LARSON to our Outdoors and Security business. LARSON is the market leader in storm and security doors and is a perfect fit with our exterior door products and outdoor living portfolio of leading brands. It is a high-performing business with a phenomenal team and best-in-class products and customer relationships. We're off to a great start with LARSON and are excited to accelerate value creation with advantage to Fortune Brands' core competencies in synergistic portfolio.
Sales in our legacy Doors brands experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity from distribution wins. The synergies and scale emerging from our shared wholesale distribution for doors and decking has been particularly advantageous to 2020 share gains.
Turning to Security. Sales returned to growth with retail producing double-digit growth and commercial markets remain soft as the sales channel remained largely closed. We are continuing to innovate in our security product lines with touchless and connected products for residential and commercial applications and feel good about the progress that the business is making under its new leadership.
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales increased low double digits with growth across product lines at all price points, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points over last year to 11.6%. This past year, the business has demonstrated how our pivot plan has worked, producing outperformance across vastly different market environments under extremely challenging conditions. After more than 2 years of aggressive repositioning, this business is now squarely centered on the heart of the market and has proven it can achieve and sustain share gains with leverage through the P&L, producing higher margins. 
The make-to-order market has returned to solid growth with the stabilization of imports and the rise in home sales and remodeling activity. The streamlining of our make-to-order business is now delivering, and we are being rewarded with incremental business from our advantaged dealer network. We continue to further optimize the supply chain to prepare for growth at higher margins over the next few years.
Within our value price point cabinets, we continue to gain share from both domestic players and from the absence of Chinese suppliers, who've exited the market over the past few months or who've been replaced to a lesser extent, with other importers with higher costs and longer lead times. Our advantaged low-cost country supply chain is competing and winning against domestic competitors and higher costing imports. 
Our Cabinets team has succeeded in repositioning products to win in the market and has improved the cost structure of the business. More opportunities lie ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same aggressiveness and tenacity demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid teens margins.
In summary, 2020 was an unprecedented year that has reshaped many facets of our society. And also shown a bright light on the value of the home and the role it plays in people's lives. We're proud to work towards our purpose of fulfilling dreams of home, now more than ever. Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and lower supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for housing. With our excellent teams, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are perfectly positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders.
As we continue to outperform the strong home products market, we are accelerating our journey to improve operating margins and are ahead of schedule. While the immediate economic outlook and pandemic environment remain uncertain and supply chains and cost inflation may introduce some volatility, we have proven our ability to perform in a variety of market conditions. We will continue to operate the business with focus and agility while investing in key strategic initiatives to deliver excellent long-term results for stakeholders. 
Our teams yet again delivered excellent results in a challenging environment. We remain focused on keeping our people safe and serving our customers. We're investing for the long-term and continue to demonstrate that this business model and management team have multiple pods to increasing growth and profitability. We're excited to be in the early innings of a multiyear expansion in U.S. housing. While we are far from prior peaks and housing activity, our business has grown stronger and has more scale than at any prior time in its history. 
As the market expands to full the much-needed demand for U.S. housing, we expect to scale with demand and continue to take share, consistent with our track record. Our portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market is more innovative and has broader channel exposure than ever, combined with our own actions to continuously improve the business and our proven resilience, we are uniquely positioned to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion, while managing any volatility that may come our way.
Our 2021 outlook, which Pat will speak to in greater detail, reflects the strength of our business, with robust growth translated to excellent profit leverage, while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond. In addition, our balance sheet is strong and positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for our world-class brands and people can accomplish. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"

Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year a",1681,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.
Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $246 million, up 19% or $40 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 70 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.25 for the quarter, up 25% versus $1 for the same quarter last year. Our associates focused on safety and on serving our customers during challenging circumstances made these remarkable results possible. 
Our teams used the circumstances of 2020 to enhance focus, improving share competitiveness and cost efficiency, driving 2020 growth and accelerating our margin improvement trajectory, providing an excellent 2021 setup. Our advantage business model with leading brands and channel positions allowed us to navigate 2020's uncertainties to outperform the markets in which we operate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $638 million, up $89 million or 16% or up 15% adjusting for FX. Fourth quarter growth was strong double digits across all major products, channels and geographies. Full year 2020 sales were up almost 9% versus 2019. 
Plumbing operating income increased 17% to $139 million for the current quarter. Operating income for the full year was $490 million, an increase of 12% over 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.8% and over 22% for the full year. Our Global Plumbing Group concluded its fifth straight year of strong growth and margin performance. Our strategies are clearly working, and we expect another strong year for Plumbing in 2021.
Now turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the fourth quarter were $367 million, up $35 million or 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Doors and Decking and a return to growth in Security. Full year 2020 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of over 5% versus the prior year. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth, with particular strength continuing in Doors and Decking. Door sales were up double digits in the fourth quarter, driven by strong retail POS and accelerating single-family new construction. We expect sales growth to continue in 2021 as both retail and new construction remains strong.
Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. We added incremental capacity during the quarter and more capacity will come online in 2021. The secular trends favoring composite decking remain as strong as ever. Security sales returned to growth in the quarter with retail products growing double digits, while commercial products and markets remained soft due to COVID 19.
Outdoors & Securities segment operating income was $58 million during the quarter, up 17% over the same quarter last year, driven by operating improvement in Doors and Decking. Operating income for the full year was $205 million, an increase of approximately 16% versus 2019. Segment operating margin for Outdoors & Security increased 90 basis points for the quarter over last year to 15.8% and was 14.5% for the full year, up 130 basis points versus 2019.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the fourth quarter were $656 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2019. Full year 2020 sales were $2.5 billion, up 3.4%. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to growth this quarter, a positive signal for big ticket R&R and reflective of the stabilization of imports and consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. 
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $76 million, up 27% or $16 million versus the prior year, and full year operating income was $256 million, up 11% or $26 million versus 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 11.6% and 10.4% for the full year, up 150 and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. 
Full year cabinet's margin performance was very strong, given big ticket R&R, inclusive of Cabinets, experienced the most severe demand and operating impacts during the second quarter COVID shutdown. We are very pleased with cabinet's second half margin performance of 11.9% and strong year-end exit rate. We expect Cabinets operating margin improvement to continue in 2021 as we build on our efforts in 2020 to further enact operational efficiencies and aggressively leverage our market-beating growth.
For FBHS as a whole, to sum up our full year consolidated 2020 performance, sales increased approximately 6% to over $6 billion for the first time ever as a public company. EPS grew over 16% to $4.19, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement by outperforming the markets in which we operate in an increasingly efficient manner. Our total company operating margin was up 80 basis points to 14.1%, ahead of our full year 2020 plan.
Free cash flow was $742 million, reflecting a conversion rate of 126%. 2021 profit growth will benefit from the efficiency programs initiated in 2020 and the continuation of a strong U.S. housing market. This will result in positive operating leverage across the company as we continue to enact Fortune Brands' core capabilities across the portfolio.
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on expected signs of material and cost inflation in the face of current elevated demand and amid a backdrop of a fundamentally strong housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our business. We do this through continuous cost improvement within our operations, having enacted major improvements just within the past year. 
We also employ cost-sharing with suppliers where appropriate and continuously look for ways to add flexibility and durability to our global supply chain. Finally, when necessary, we act via pricing. Through this combination of actions, we expect to navigate 2021 inflation and achieve our margin improvement objectives. We will mitigate, offset and overcome inflationary headwind and deliver our goals of market beating growth and continued margin expansion.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $419 million, net debt of $2.2 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ended the year at 2.1x or slightly below 2x on a pro forma basis, inclusive of LARSON EBITDA. We now have $865 million of total liquidity available between our $1.25 billion revolver and supplemental $400 million revolver. We have the ability to make investments and deploy capital to accelerate growth and shareholder value creation and are assessing opportunities to do so. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through targeted buybacks and our dividend.
Turning to the details of our outlook for 2021. Based on the global market for our products growing 5% to 7%, with the U.S. housing market also growing 5% to 7%, and within this market forecast, we expect U.S. new construction growth of 10% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 4% to 6%. Based on those assumptions, we expect 2021 full year sales growth of 12.5% to 14.5% or 5.5% to 7.5%, excluding LARSON. We expect full year EPS within the range of $4.85 to $5.05 on a before-charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to 18% EPS growth versus 2020.
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan. Plumbing net sales growth of 7% to 9%, with operating margins of 22 plus percent. Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 35% to 37% or 5% to 7% ex LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14% to 15%, or approximately 15% to 16%, adjusting for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses. 
Cabinets net sales growth of 5% to 7% with operating margins of 11% to 12%. We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $600 million to $650 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $92 million to $93 million; interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million; a tax rate between 24.5% and 25%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 140 million to 141 million.  
To summarize, we have put together a 2021 plan that provides solid sales and excellent EPS growth, while we continue to accelerate investments in brand, innovation and advantaged Fortune Brands capabilities. Potential exists for upside to our plan and guidance if some combination of the following occurs. Labor is available to address in full the strong expected U.S. new construction and big ticket R&R demand; if U.S. R&R growth improves beyond the 4% to 6% assumed in our plan; government stimulus increases materially beyond programs currently in place without impacting interest rates. Better insight to these opportunities will unfold during the first half. As this occurs and as merited, we will refine our guidance accordingly. 
We expect a long runway of fundamental U.S. housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. With market growth averaging 5-plus percent per year over the next few years, assuming the current level of unemployment continues to stabilize than improves. We expect our sales to continue outperforming the market and our margin progression to remain accelerated, averaging improvement above 50 basis points in 2021 in each of the next 2 to 3 years.
Our balance sheet strength supports capital deployment and while we delivered over $1 billion in M&A, share repurchases and dividends in 2020, we are still advantageously positioned to assess further opportunities to deploy capital. We see multiple paths to value creation to execute for our shareholders, and our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. Our teams remain committed to driving market-beating sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.

And it seems like the midpoint of the revenue guide for this year implies something that's kind of at the lower end of that range in terms of the incrementals. 
And Pat, I know that you laid out some of the factors that you're kind of thinking about that could impact where you end up for this year, but can you kind of outline for us maybe some of the things that could take you to the higher end of that 20% or 30% range?

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while.

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while. And on an organic basis, next year, we'll be very much approaching that. We should be at 15% or very close to it on an organic basis by the end of next year, which means on an organic basis, we'll be driving 70 to 80 basis points of margin improvement, if not more, and be on the higher side of that incremental margin. 
We do -- as we fold LARSON into the business, we have some purchase accounting and some integration costs. So our reported margin might be closer to 14.5% for the year. But we expect over '20 and '21 combined to achieve 150 basis points of total margin improvement we've been talking about for a while. And as we get through '21 to be driving for the next 2 to 3 years, 50-plus basis points for each of the following years after that. 
And so very much on track, if not ahead of track, with where we were at the Investor Day, we had held all the way back in February '19, despite multiple tariff waves and a pandemic. So we feel good about the margin trajectory. And I think, Sue, as we continue to drive market-beating growth and manage our SG&A tightly, we could stay on the higher side of that leverage range."

I'll just add that if you step back a little bit, we set out as a team to really accelerate the flywheel within the business. So investing in core capabilities across the entire platform to generate fuel for growth with the intention that a portion of that would be seen through margin accretion, and a portion of that would be generated to incrementally invest in the business to drive more top line. And once the pandemic hit, we really used it as a platform to accelerate our plans and are delighted with how we've emerged. 
Basically, probably about a year ahead of schedule from where we thought we were. But having made far more incremental investments in the business in 2020 than I think we would have expected at the outset of the year, with plans to continue that in '21 and beyond. 
And so this flywheel really is  working now. And you'll see it through our organic margin, as Pat described, but also through our investment profile as we continue to invest in brand, in innovation, in capacity and in capability in the business."

And so I don't think we lie awake at night on inflation or think that, that's going to hold us back. In fact, we're committed to drive the margin improvement through that inflation. But I think there will be multiple episodes and some of the timing of that will unfold as we pursue the next couple of years."

But I'll tell you, I mean, firstly, hats off to our team to be able to kind of deliver these quarters of growth, because you're right, it does stretch capacity. And when you drill down and look in pockets of the business where it really was surging and people working literally around the clock to make it happen. 
And so we have been stretched. I think the feedback from customers is more pleased, but they've been very satisfied with the fact that I think we stayed a step ahead of the competition. And that has really helped fuel our share gains, because we've been reliable through this period, notwithstanding the fact that it's taken a lot of work. 
And so we're working hard. And as we built out a plan for '21, we hypersensitized, I would say, to both an upside scenario and a downside scenario. And so in a downside scenario, we're ready to manage the P&L very, very tightly, manage expenses very, very tightly to deliver the kind of margin progression that we were just talking about there with Sue. But we've sensitized on the upside as well, and to the extent that there's upside, we're leaning into capacity investments and inventory to be able to serve the market and capture that upside.
The housing market is undeniably strong. And we don't just view this as a pocket of strength. I mean you go all the way back to the fundamentals. They support this and this expansion is going to have to go on for a long time in order to support it, because we're just fundamentally underbuilt in U.S. housing, and there might be bumps along the way. But over time, this will play out very strongly. And so therefore, we have confidence in leaning in towards that capacity and the capacity investment in inventory because we know that the market needs it. 
Is there any color you want to add?"

And I mean, you're looking at something like 5 years now of just consistent market outperformance at increasing margins. And so really phenomenal performance to put up 16 -- in excess of 16% growth in the quarter, just to get into capacity. I mean just the ability to do that alone is impressive. 
But we're feeling really good about it, Phil. I mean firstly, it's been going on for a long time now, right? It's not kind of this one-off. It's been going on for a long time. It was -- as your question, it was really strong across the board. As you know, retail was very strong, in particular, throughout the year. But as the wholesale channel opened back up, we did see it start to pick up momentum, and we saw that momentum accelerate. 
And by the time we got to the end of the year, we saw healthy growth in every part of that business barn on. I mean it's rare that you get to say that, that it was just everywhere, but it really was everywhere. And hard to service it, whether it be in retail and e-com, in wholesale or in China. The other exciting thing you asked, is there room to go. I mean notwithstanding the fact that the business is able to do that and the business delivered margin in excess of 22%, it also upped its incremental investment significantly. 
So investment in brand was up almost $15 million year-on-year, $10 million in the quarter. I mean that's significant investments in packaging refresh, investments in capabilities like e-commerce and operations as well as things like supply chain, around head count, in our DCs, airfreight to meet a customer demand. And so really putting an investment that sets the business up to continue to grow. And as you step away from that, what do you have, you have this brand that we're investing behind, which is just absolutely refreshed and peaking. Consumers love it. It's #1 for purchase intent. And so we feel really strongly about that. We've invested in the channel and our supply chain capacity. And so we're there to serve. 
And then we're building out these new adjacencies, these future cores of the business and those are starting to really gain traction. And we're seeing it in areas like the smart home, where you've seen the products done things like U by Moen. We just won a CES Best of Innovation Winner for U by Moen Smart Faucet. We won some recognition at CES with the USA Today's Editor's Choice on our U by Moen flood smart pump, sump pump monitor, which we just launched. 
What's really exciting about is when you start to tie all that stuff together, what you'll start to see in 2021 is that we're really building out that whole smart home ecosystem. And all of these elements are going to start to talk to each other and be able to do water conservation, freeze protection, vacation modes. And so when you pose that question, do we see room to go? I would say, absolutely. We're performing really well in the core faucets and showerheads. But the business has gotten so good at just leveraging it's kind of twin assets of brand and and channel strength to build out these adjacencies.
I think you'll see some near-in adjacencies that will perform in the near-term and then really building out future cores with some of these further out adjacencies that are really starting to gain traction. So we're feeling great. The business has been great under Cheri Phyfer's leadership.

I certainly wholeheartedly agree with your outlook on the housing market. And I definitely think that it's going to be interesting to see how you can leverage that strength, and you've given some really good commentary here, particularly on a multiyear basis on the margin. What I wanted to ask you about, though, is closer in, it seems like this year, having a little bit of guidance or maybe some handholding from you all with respect to the sequential progression of sales might be helpful, just given how weird last year obviously was. 
Is there a way that we can think about what we might expect to see or what you all are expecting to see in terms of the sequential trajectory as you progress from 1Q through into the back half of FY '21? Some help -- way that you could help us to envision something like what you're foreseeing?"

Stephen, it's a tricky business even for those of us here who watch kind of the daily order flow in shipments. I think what we could say is, obviously, from our results, the fourth quarter finished very strongly, right? We delivered double-digit growth across all the lines of business. And you saw that in POS as much as you saw in shipments. We're still kind of in a mode where we're largely shipping to POS at this point. 
And I think that will continue through a good part of the first quarter to half of the year. And the POS momentum from the fourth quarter has largely carried into the opening month of this year and doesn't seem to be abating. So we would definitely expect double-digit growth for the first quarter at least, and that could easily continue into the second quarter given last year you were shut down for at least about half of the quarter. And then we'll see where it goes from there. 
I think when we looked at understanding a market and setting guidance for the full year, you see some pretty wide goalpost on external data for U.S. R&R and U.S. new construction. As you noticed, we come out on, but I think the bullish side of it because we think that this is underpinned by fundamental demographics and other drivers of the macro that are not just episodic here. And so we'll see if the back half of the year is kind of flat to low single-digit growth or it gets a lot better. 
I think there's a good chance that it gets better than that. But I kind of guide you towards double-digit growth to start the year, and then we'll update you as appropriately. We don't typically give quarterly guidance, but I think what we're seeing this early part of the year is the same POS strength we saw at the end of the year."

And so those are sort of profit comps. So to kind of put up the growth that we put out and seen the POS that we saw in Q4 gives us a good degree of confidence. The fact that we've carried that momentum, that exit momentum right into what we're seeing now in January, makes us feel pretty good that there's a very solid market there on top of solid comps from the prior year."

I wanted to -- second question I had relates to the Cabinets business specifically. We think of it as primarily kitchen and bath cabinetry, and yet, one of the interesting things with the pandemic and the working from home is that people, I'm guessing, that certain population and probably one that you can cater to well would be considering maybe converting rooms to more permanent work-from-home space as opposed to something ad hoc and just throwing it together, getting something from IKEA. 
And in that regard, I'm wondering how much of your business in the Cabinet segment has historically been outside of kitchen and bath? And I'm thinking it would probably be primarily home-office type setups. And where do you think that can go?"

We don't sort of track it by -- entirely by rooms outside of kitchen and bath. But what I will say is the team there is great, is actually very focused on adjacencies and areas for growth as part of their strategic plan. But it's also being absolutely prioritized about the way in which they're going to go after things, right? 
So first and foremost, is kind of dedication to the margin journey that we're on and making sure that we are absolutely able to hit that. And again, you see the exit rate here for Q4 and even the exit rate that Pat referenced for the second half at 11.9%, very satisfied with how they're tracking. And they're not satisfied, though, to sit on that. They're working very hard to say what's the journey time, the team's objective and even beyond it. So that's our priority #1. 
Priority #2 is capturing the share from the imports. And they've done a phenomenal job of that. And if you look at the imports, while some of that has flowed back, it is at a much higher AUP than was previously, right? So less volume, higher price. That's absolutely the landscape in which we want to compete, which is an even playing field. And so we're competing there and winning. And then from there, I'd say it's new channels and new products. And so new channels, there's a lot of opportunity in e-commerce. We're starting to see that come to fruition and investing behind the opportunity there. And then adjacencies. 
So areas like other rooms. Is there expansion beyond the kitchen where other areas or other vanities. And so that's the order of priority. I'd say that they're attacking these things. And we'll get off of them. And I think as we do, you're going to see both the margin progression that we're absolutely committed to delivering, but also because of what you touched on as well as some of the other areas, I've touched on, there'll be some really nice growth as well."

And if you -- the way we kind of put it together, starting from the very strong performance in this year. Decking, as I said, in excess of 30% in Q4. And again, a real lap there, right, because you had product load-ins ahead of the distribution gains in Q4 of '19. And then we're seeing really, really strong performance in Doors as well. I would say on the Decking side, we've got a capacity plan, and we're kind of working through our capacity plan and then we will try to work an upside plan for that capacity plan to the extent that we're able to bring that upside plan to fruition or see more pricing momentum on Decking, which I think that sector probably merits. There's some upside there. 
And then I think in Doors, there may well be certainly, if the momentum that we're seeing continues, and it's really both wholesale and retail. So it's not just new construction part, but in retail as well. Then we would see it there as well. We were somewhat cautious as we built the plan around just the strength of what we saw towards the end of the year, both in Doors and in our LARSON acquisition. And so we want to kind of progress through the first quarter, and see how that's going. 
But again, the momentum in both of those businesses, like we touched on Plumbing and Cabinets has continued to be very strong and has maintained its velocity coming out the back end of the year. And so I don't disagree with you. I think we put together a prudent plan, and we are still cognizant of the fact that there is pandemic and economic uncertainty out in the world, and we want to manage the P&L very tightly. But we're gearing the business and the capacity to the upside there. And I think you touched on a couple of areas in which it could happen. 
And then just turning to your question on Security. I fully agree with you. We would like to see more growth now. You had a couple of things, a couple dynamics in the year, you had on the retail side of business, you had back-to-school season that just didn't happen, right? We saw a lot of [indiscernible] like that. And you had a commercial channel where we go in, really into a consultative sale with factories and facilities that shut down in Q2 and stayed shutdown throughout the rest of the year. 
We actually exited the fourth quarter with really nice growth in retail in the double digits. And so we were really encouraged by that. And where we got the business squarely focused is on getting the product assortment right, getting the supply chain absolutely set, getting the category management capabilities in and once all that is set, and we made some really good progress and invested for it in 2020, then we're going to start to turn the dial harder on things like innovation, which should then start to raise the top line. 
And so we wanted to be very deliberate about that progression, getting that core right, getting the operations and supply chain absolutely stable and healthy and producing, and then kind of turning them to growth. Although even given that, we were happy to see retail, which is the biggest part of the business, power along as it did at the end of the quarter."

Mike, I think just to add to what Nick was saying, I think he hit on the key points. I think there is potential upside to both Doors and decking. I think in decking, the hit on it, it's the pace of our capacity plan and the pricing dynamics in the marketplace, those things could lend upside if they go faster than we are expecting. 
And then Doors, think of the Doors business is probably the 1 business we have that's closer to 50-50 new construction and R&R as opposed to most of our portfolio's about 2/3 or more R&R. And as you recall, our outlook on U.S. new construction is 10% to 12%, I think there's upside to Doors to the extent that builders can pace completions closer to their order flow. 
Our market outlook is really predicated on about 100,000 unit growth in U.S. housing, but that's about 110 to 100 of -- I'm sorry, that's 100 to 110 of new construction -- single-family new construction housing growth and a decline in multifamily for a total of about 75,000 units across the two. So I think it really gets down to kind of the pacing of completions in single-family pickup, and that will help drive that business. 
And then to Nick's point on Security is can we get a real back-to-school season? Can we get the industrial markets opened up as consultants are allowed in factories and get innovation going in that business. Those are the things."

And just wanted to circle back to a prior question around cadence throughout the year and very much appreciate the talk around the top line, where you're saying double-digit top line growth likely to continue into the first quarter, possibly the second. It sounded like by contrast, just again at this point of the year, and obviously, the way the numbers would work, flat to up low single digits, which is still very impressive, obviously, given the tough comps and I think most people would be some -- many people would be thinking perhaps it would be down a little bit. 
So I just want to make sure I heard that right that at this point in the game, as you look at your plans, you're looking for flat to maybe up slightly in the back half? And what that means for EPS distribution? Typically, during the year, you have anywhere from 40% to 45% or so of EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 55%, 60% in the back half. I would almost think this year that would flip. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that."

I'll give you some perspective, and then Pat will speak a little bit to the numbers. But I would say, firstly, just kind of step back from a market perspective, we're very fortunate the 2 most favorable housing markets in the world, the U.S. and China markets, right? And that's where you see the most growth and the most opportunity. And China is sort of the rare market that is not only growing quickly, but also is quite fragmented. 
And so there's still an opportunity to build a lot of share over time. And our business there has been built organically over a long time with a homegrown team that has out-executed that market and now is very focused not on just out executing the top line, but driving profit and driving leverage through the P&L. As much just as good discipline to be able to reinvest in the business for the long run, as a profit driver for us overall, it's really more -- we want that business to be disciplined and to be healthy and be able to to continue to drive itself. And so they've grown incredibly quickly, and the focus has really been on leveraging our brand and channel position into new product adjacencies and new channel adjacencies. 
And I think they do it better than anybody in our business. They really kind of are our North Star for the rest of Fortune Brands in their approach. When you look at the more recent performance, it's continued to power on. We obviously saw the shutdown around Chinese new year and then continue on. As you know, the Chinese economy actually did pretty well, grew a bit over 2% for the year. So pretty impressive. And we're calculating or basing sort of somewhere between 6, maybe a bit more. 
Where we continue to see strength throughout the year was really in the developer side of the business and in the e-commerce side of the business. Showrooms were slower as people were still cautious to head out. But we have a leading share in developer, so we were very excited about that, and developers continue to build. And bear in mind, we're really prioritized on Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. So we're not really exposed to the big speculative buildings and the empty cities that you hear about. We're really big share in Shanghai and other densely populated areas where people are either moving in or upgrading their living circumstances. 
And so we're very bullish on the opportunity in China. Housing continues to be a fundamentally important part of that country's economy, and so we don't see that backing down. And then within housing, we're out executing, and we're out executing with a homegrown team that really knows how to build out the Moen brand and the House of ROHL brands into even broader adjacencies and how to build out new channels and new channel partners. 
And while we've been doing this, actually in 2020, we raised our, let's say, an incremental investment in that business and really started folding the pull behind the brands, not just the push model that we've done really well with over time. And the early read on the brand metrics have been extremely strong. And so we're very excited about China. We think over the long term, it could be a really nice play for our company. We don't necessarily bank on it in any given year, but we've just grown it slowly -- or not so slowly, but I'd say, over a long period of time, to the point where now it's a significant player in that market and can be a significant growth contributor for us."

Recall, firstly, we never counted on government assistance to help us. We set about pivoting the portfolio to really aim at the heart of that market like what was working there anyway and adjusted our portfolio to really target that heart of the market. But then we were successful in the anti-dumping suit. And the purpose of that really was to get rid of illegal subsidies and unfair composition. It wasn't to close the board and all imports. And we're happy to import -- we're happy to compete against other low-cost countries, and we feel not only we set up to compete, we're set up to win. 
And I think that's what's now playing out. And so as you've seen, those imports start to migrate to other countries. And by the way, a lot of that is illegal transshipping. And I think customs is going to be all over that. But you're seeing it come across at a higher cost, either because it truly is manufactured in another country. So average selling price out of Vietnam is more than 2x what the China AUP is or it's being illegally transshipped, but frankly, moving stuff from 1 country to another and trying to evade customs has a cost to it, that's being reflected in the marketplace. 
And so I'm sure you're seeing it through your channel checks. But you go to the channel checks. You'll hear that imports are still struggling from a supply chain perspective, lead times are long and pricing is up. And that is a very favorable backdrop for which for us to compete. And that's why it's 1 of the reasons why we're not seeing growth across the board, even though you could argue on a dollar perspective, those imports are kind of probably at a dollar level where they were prior to the run-up of inventory with the duties coming on. 
The playing field is level and the business is competing well. And that's the only outcome we could have hoped for. And again, not trying to shut a Board, we're just trying to have a level playing field. And it's had the necessary impact. We will, however, continue to aggressively investigate or help pursue anybody who cheats and there's going to be cheating happening, but it happens with enough incremental cost, but I think it's leveled out the playing field enough.

And so if you really look at the back half margin of that business, which is 11.9%, I think it's more indicative of kind of where they're running at these days. And you hit out 1 of the levers to kind of get this farther up the margin chain and more towards that mid teens. 
I think there's room to go on both the stock and the make-to-order side of the businesses. We'll deal with inflation in our Cabinet business as we do in all of our businesses. We'll take continuous cost improvement and supply chain actions that were necessary price to drive improvement offsets inflation. And then I think getting leveraged to get further margin expansion, there's still a lot of growth on the asset and SG&A base and stock and also, I would say, during '20, we were repurposing some older capacity on the fly and still are in the early parts of this year, that is not the optimal way to service demand. We're doing that just because the demand is so strong. So there's still some footprint optimization to go in the stock business. 
And then I think we did a lot of hard work to standardize product and rightsize the semi-custom and premium make-to-order businesses. A, there's still some more standardization opportunity out there. And all the hard work to rightsize those businesses, and now that those businesses are growing, you're going to see in '21 and beyond, the ability to leverage the tough restructuring work that the teams have been doing for the 2 years in that business. So I think you're going to see both stock and make-to-order contributing to growth from this point forward. 
I think what you haven't seen and really until the back half of this year is on the stock side. You still had so many things moving to service demand. You weren't seeing the optimal long-term cost structure for the stock side, and you were still seeing decline in make-to-order. And it's only now that we're seeing the stock gets closer to its end game, and we're seeing growth in make-to-order to leverage that resized business. 
So I think there's good opportunity ahead for both of them. And we're wide eyed to the competition. As Nick said, we built a better mousetrap. We're not looking for the government to give that business margin and that business is demonstrating that it can compete for share and turn it into margin accretion."

I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe. I could not be prouder of what we achieved in 2020, our strong fourth quarter results capped a remarkable full year performance by our teams. Facing unprecedented challenges, we drove market-beating growth and delivered on our margin expansion strategy ahead of schedule.
During the year, we deployed over $1 billion in capital towards M&A, share buybacks and dividends, generated excellent free cash flow and exited the year with attractive leverage. And amidst all of this activity, our teams worked tirelessly to keep consumers and customers supplied while maintaining industry-leading safety performance and has truly been an extraordinary year. 
All of our businesses saw impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. And we drove margin improvement in each segment by delivering against strong demand for our leading brands and leveraging our efficiency programs. Importantly, this past year, we also made critical long-term investments in our brands, innovation, Fortune Brands' core capabilities and supply chain capacity that will enable us to capture future opportunities and accelerate our share gains.
Over the last 8 quarters, we have shown that we can deliver results and create value for our stakeholders in a variety of market conditions. We are positioned to capture growth as the market accelerates and are structured to tightly manage our P&L in times of slower expansion. With the initiatives that we've undertaken, the investments that we have made, and momentum that we are seeing, we expect even stronger sales and profit growth as we enter 2021.
Looking forward, we are in the early stages of a long-term expansion of U.S. housing. As has been widely noted, the extent to which U.S. housing has been underbuilt is several multiples greater than the overbuilding of the mid-2000s. And yet, new construction starts are far short of their peak and only now reaching historic averages. Low supply and high demand, coupled with favorable demographics and low interest rates have unleashed delayed momentum into our marketplace. Given the low inventory of housing, this momentum impacts both new construction and repair and remodel activity as the aging housing supply requires renovation. Given supply side constraints, we expect this momentum to play out over several years.
Turning to 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of this expanding housing market. We've done a lot to replatform the business, to be even more efficient and agile and will continue to do more in the year ahead. While economic and pandemic uncertainties still exist, we will stay flexible and nimble and manage the business very tightly. We expect to capture increasing opportunities in this market and have scenario planned for challenges that could arise.
The last 8 quarters have demonstrated that we can excel in playing offense and defense and can deliver for shareholders in a variety of market environments. We are well positioned and are very excited for the year ahead.
I want to thank all of our dedicated team members who continue to work so hard to keep our people safe and our facilities operating. I am so proud of our teams, who are not only caring for each other, but who are doing so while serving strong demand for home products. Our people are the foundation upon which our business is built, and they drove our outstanding results in 2020.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our fourth quarter and full year results as well as discuss our key initiatives and how we expect to evolve over time. And then Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as our thoughts around our future financial performance expectations for 2021. 
Now turning to our view on the housing market. As I've mentioned, long-term fundamentals continue to be very favorable for housing and home products. U.S. housing is currently substantially underbuilt, and we are uniquely positioned with our brands and channels to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity.
Additionally, the key millennial generation has accelerated their delayed move towards household formation and are showing increased interest in homeownership. Pandemic or no pandemic, this generation's move towards household formation had to happen as they form families and we simply lack the housing stock to support it. Moreover, increased workplace flexibility has allowed many younger homeowners to leverage technology allowed for larger homes further from urban cores. Multifunctional spaces within the home as well as increased trends towards entertaining at home and outdoor living are accelerating new home buying and remodeling.
New construction activity has remained strong since the latter half of 2019, except during a brief COVID shutdown driven by very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates, and is showing no signs of slowing down. The strength of our new construction channel gives us exposure to excellent growth as builders work to meet the significant demand. 
Repair and remodel activity remains very strong as consumers continue their focus on home improvement and spending to refurbish older homes. With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventory is being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. Additionally, with home values on the rise as well as homeowner balance sheet strength and home equity levels at or near all-time highs, we expect R&R on our activity through 2021 and beyond. We believe our advantaged mix of exposure to the stable repair and remodel market, combined with the torque of a strong new construction market gives us an unparalleled opportunity to add long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Given current market fundamentals, including very favorable demographics, low inventory and an aged housing stock, we see a very positive multiyear tailwind powering the U.S. housing market to consistent mid-single-digit R&R growth and high single-digit single-family new construction growth, which could be even higher in the near term. Consistent with our long history, we intend to outperform any market conditions that materialize.
As we have demonstrated over the last 2 years, our ability to capture the upside afforded by new construction exposure as well as effectively manage periods of softer demand and for when market conditions change, uniquely positions us to drive both growth and margins with a portfolio of leading brands and advantaged channel positions.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total sales increased approximately 13% over last year, and operating margin increased to 14.8%. This performance was the result of exceptional operational execution in a strong market, while our teams continue to serve robust demand. We drove solid margin improvement as we saw the continued benefit of our efficiency programs implemented in early 2020.
Consistent with our strategy, our fuel for growth program allowed us to invest heavily in key growth initiatives, including the Moen brand, innovation, decking capacity and distribution rollout and value-priced cabinetry capacity. We also continue to invest in replatforming our business through advantaged Fortune Brands' common core competencies, including complexity reduction, category management and global supply chain management. We are accelerating investments in our most critical priorities as we position for continued growth in 2021 and for the longer term.
Importantly, these cost company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule as reflected in our 2020 results, and will continue to compound in 2021 and beyond. We will continue to drive a common set of capabilities to fuel growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses, and how we are positioning to be even stronger long term. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets, with sales up mid-teens in the quarter and operating margins of 21.8%. We experienced strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Plumbing investments in marketing and innovation continue to fuel remarkable results. Our Global Plumbing Group's ability to pursue growth in both core and adjacencies is creating new opportunities for this business to continue producing market-leading growth. Our sustained investment in brand, newer channels such as e-commerce as well as an on-trend innovation sets GPG up for continued long-term success.
We also achieved solid growth in China during the fourth quarter. Moen continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, driving excellent leverage to the bottom line. In China, housing continues to be an important overall component of economic growth and the Chinese economy.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased double digits and operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 15.8%. These exceptional results were driven by double-digit decking and doors growth, a return to growth in security and strong segment operating performance. Importantly, our Fiberon decking brand continued to grow in excess of 30%, notwithstanding the lapping of product load-ins ahead of distribution gains in Q4 of 2019. Decking momentum continues to benefit from our distribution wins and execution as we position the brand for long-term growth in a market fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials.
The pandemic has accelerated consumers' focus on outdoor living, and we are seeing continued strong demand for our products. Our distribution wins and capacity expansion plans remain on track. We had incremental capacity come online in the fourth quarter and will expand further at multiple points in time throughout 2021.
To further capture the momentum in outdoor living and leverage opportunities as the market leader in exterior door products, we added LARSON to our Outdoors and Security business. LARSON is the market leader in storm and security doors and is a perfect fit with our exterior door products and outdoor living portfolio of leading brands. It is a high-performing business with a phenomenal team and best-in-class products and customer relationships. We're off to a great start with LARSON and are excited to accelerate value creation with advantage to Fortune Brands' core competencies and synergistic portfolio.
Sales in our legacy Doors brands experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity from distribution wins. The synergies and scale emerging from our shared wholesale distribution for doors and decking has been particularly advantageous to 2020 share gains.
Turning to Security. Sales returned to growth with retail producing double-digit growth and commercial markets remaining soft as the sales channel remained largely closed. We are continuing to innovate in our security product lines with touchless and connected products for residential and commercial applications and feel good about the progress that the business is making under its new leadership.
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales increased low double digits with growth across product lines at all price points, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points over last year to 11.6%. This past year, the business has demonstrated how our pivot plan has worked, producing outperformance across vastly different market environments under extremely challenging conditions. After more than 2 years of aggressive repositioning, this business is now squarely centered on the heart of the market and has proven it can achieve and sustain share gains with leverage through the P&L, producing higher margins. 
The make-to-order market has returned to solid growth with the stabilization of imports and the rise in home sales and remodeling activity. The streamlining of our make-to-order business is now delivering, and we are being rewarded with incremental business from our advantaged dealer network. We continue to further optimize the supply chain to prepare for growth at higher margins over the next few years.
Within our value price point cabinets, we continue to gain share from both domestic players and from the absence of Chinese suppliers, who've exited the market over the past few months or who've been replaced to a lesser extent, with other importers with higher costs and longer lead times. Our advantaged low-cost country supply chain is competing and winning against domestic competitors and higher costing imports. 
Our Cabinets team has succeeded in repositioning products to win in the market and has improved the cost structure of the business. More opportunities lie ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same aggressiveness and tenacity demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid teens margins.
In summary, 2020 was an unprecedented year that has reshaped many facets of our society. And also shown a bright light on the value of the home and the role it plays in people's lives. We're proud to work towards our purpose of fulfilling dreams of home, now more than ever. Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and lower supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for housing. With our excellent teams, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are perfectly positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders.
As we continue to outperform the strong home products market, we are accelerating our journey to improve operating margins and are ahead of schedule. While the immediate economic outlook and pandemic environment remain uncertain and supply chains and cost inflation may introduce some volatility, we have proven our ability to perform in a variety of market conditions. We will continue to operate the business with focus and agility while investing in key strategic initiatives to deliver excellent long-term results for stakeholders. 
Our teams yet again delivered excellent results in a challenging environment. We remain focused on keeping our people safe and serving our customers. We're investing for the long-term and continue to demonstrate that this business model and management team have multiple pods to increasing growth and profitability. We're excited to be in the early innings of a multiyear expansion in U.S. housing. While we are far from prior peaks in housing activity, our business is growing stronger and it has more scale than at any prior time in its history. 
As the market expands to fill the much-needed demand for U.S. housing, we expect to scale with that demand and continue to take share, consistent with our track record. Our portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market is more innovative and has broader channel exposure than ever.  Combined with our own actions to continuously improve the business and our proven resilience, we are uniquely positioned to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion, while managing any volatility that may come our way.
Our 2021 outlook, which Pat will speak to in greater detail, reflects the strength of our business, with robust growth translating to excellent profit leverage, while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond. In addition, our balance sheet is strong and positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for what our world-class brands and people can accomplish. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"

And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year a",1681,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.
Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $246 million, up 19% or $40 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 70 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.25 for the quarter, up 25% versus $1 for the same quarter last year. Our associates focused on safety and on serving our customers during challenging circumstances made these remarkable results possible. 
Our teams used the circumstances of 2020 to enhance focus, improving share competitiveness and cost efficiency, driving 2020 growth and accelerating our margin improvement trajectory, providing an excellent 2021 setup. Our advantage business model with leading brands and channel positions allowed us to navigate 2020's uncertainties to outperform the markets in which we operate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $638 million, up $89 million or 16% or up 15% adjusting for FX. Fourth quarter growth was strong double digits across all major products, channels and geographies. Full year 2020 sales were up almost 9% versus 2019. 
Plumbing operating income increased 17% to $139 million for the current quarter. Operating income for the full year was $490 million, an increase of 12% over 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.8% and over 22% for the full year. Our Global Plumbing Group concluded its fifth straight year of strong growth and margin performance. Our strategies are clearly working, and we expect another strong year for Plumbing in 2021.
Now turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the fourth quarter were $367 million, up $35 million or 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Doors and Decking and a return to growth in Security. Full year 2020 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of over 5% versus the prior year. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth, with particular strength continuing in Doors and Decking. Door sales were up double digits in the fourth quarter, driven by strong retail POS and accelerating single-family new construction. We expect sales growth to continue in 2021 as both retail and new construction remains strong.
Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. We added incremental capacity during the quarter and more capacity will come online in 2021. The secular trends favoring composite decking remain as strong as ever. Security sales returned to growth in the quarter with retail products growing double digits, while commercial products and markets remained soft due to COVID 19.
Outdoors & Securities segment operating income was $58 million during the quarter, up 17% over the same quarter last year, driven by operating improvement in Doors and Decking. Operating income for the full year was $205 million, an increase of approximately 16% versus 2019. Segment operating margin for Outdoors & Security increased 90 basis points for the quarter over last year to 15.8% and was 14.5% for the full year, up 130 basis points versus 2019.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the fourth quarter were $656 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2019. Full year 2020 sales were $2.5 billion, up 3.4%. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to growth this quarter, a positive signal for big ticket R&R and reflective of the stabilization of imports and consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. 
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $76 million, up 27% or $16 million versus the prior year, and full year operating income was $256 million, up 11% or $26 million versus 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 11.6% and 10.4% for the full year, up 150 and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. 
Full year cabinet's margin performance was very strong, given big ticket R&R, inclusive of Cabinets, experienced the most severe demand and operating impacts during the second quarter COVID shutdown. We are very pleased with Cabinet's second half margin performance of 11.9% and strong year-end exit rate. We expect Cabinet's operating margin improvement to continue in 2021 as we build on our efforts in 2020 to further enact operational efficiencies and aggressively leverage our market-beating growth.
For FBHS as a whole, to sum up our full year consolidated 2020 performance, sales increased approximately 6% to over $6 billion for the first time ever as a public company. EPS grew over 16% to $4.19, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement by outperforming the markets in which we operate in an increasingly efficient manner. Our total company operating margin was up 80 basis points to 14.1%, ahead of our full year 2020 plan.
Free cash flow was $742 million, reflecting a conversion rate of 126%. 2021 profit growth will benefit from the efficiency programs initiated in 2020 and the continuation of a strong U.S. housing market. This will result in positive operating leverage across the company as we continue to enact Fortune Brands' core capabilities across the portfolio.
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on expected signs of material and cost inflation in the face of current elevated demand and amid a backdrop of a fundamentally strong housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our business. We do this through continuous cost improvement within our operations, having enacted major improvements just within the past year. 
We also employ cost-sharing with suppliers where appropriate and continuously look for ways to add flexibility and durability to our global supply chain. Finally, when necessary, we act via pricing. Through this combination of actions, we expect to navigate 2021 inflation and achieve our margin improvement objectives. We will mitigate, offset and overcome inflationary headwind and deliver our goals of market beating growth and continued margin expansion.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $419 million, net debt of $2.2 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ended the year at 2.1x or slightly below 2x on a pro forma basis, inclusive of LARSON EBITDA. We now have $865 million of total liquidity available between our $1.25 billion revolver and supplemental $400 million revolver. We have the ability to make investments and deploy capital to accelerate growth and shareholder value creation and are assessing opportunities to do so. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through targeted buybacks and our dividend.
Turning to the details of our outlook for 2021. Based on the global market for our products growing 5% to 7%, with the U.S. housing market also growing 5% to 7%, and within this market forecast, we expect U.S. new construction growth of 10% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 4% to 6%. Based on those assumptions, we expect 2021 full year sales growth of 12.5% to 14.5% or 5.5% to 7.5%, excluding LARSON. We expect full year EPS within the range of $4.85 to $5.05 on a before-charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to 18% EPS growth versus 2020.
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan. Plumbing net sales growth of 7% to 9%, with operating margins of 22 plus percent. Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 35% to 37% or 5% to 7% ex LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14% to 15%, or approximately 15% to 16%, adjusting for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses. 
Cabinets net sales growth of 5% to 7% with operating margins of 11% to 12%. We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $600 million to $650 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $92 million to $93 million; interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million; a tax rate between 24.5% and 25%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 140 million to 141 million.  
To summarize, we have put together a 2021 plan that provides solid sales and excellent EPS growth, while we continue to accelerate investments in brand, innovation and advantaged Fortune Brands capabilities. Potential exists for upside to our plan and guidance if some combination of the following occurs. Labor is available to address in full the strong expected U.S. new construction and big ticket R&R demand; if U.S. R&R growth improves beyond the 4% to 6% assumed in our plan; government stimulus increases materially beyond programs currently in place without impacting interest rates. Better insight to these opportunities will unfold during the first half. As this occurs and as merited, we will refine our guidance accordingly. 
We expect a long runway of fundamental U.S. housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. With market growth averaging 5-plus percent per year over the next few years, assuming the current level of unemployment continues to stabilize then improves. We expect our sales to continue outperforming the market and our margin progression to remain accelerated, averaging improvement above 50 basis points in 2021 in each of the next 2 to 3 years.
Our balance sheet strength supports capital deployment and while we delivered over $1 billion in M&A, share repurchases and dividends in 2020, we are still advantageously positioned to assess further opportunities to deploy capital. We see multiple paths to value creation to execute for our shareholders, and our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. Our teams remain committed to driving market-beating sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.

And it seems like the midpoint of the revenue guide for this year implies something that's kind of at the lower end of that range in terms of the incrementals. 
And Pat, I know that you laid out some of the factors that you're kind of thinking about that could impact where you end up for this year, but can you kind of outline for us maybe some of the things that could take you to the higher end of that 20% or 30% range? And how you're thinking about that across each of the different segments?"

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while.

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while. And on an organic basis, next year, we'll be very much approaching that. We should be at 15% or very close to it on an organic basis by the end of next year, which means on an organic basis, we'll be driving 70 to 80 basis points of margin improvement, if not more, and be on the higher side of that incremental margin. 
We do -- as we fold LARSON into the business, we have some purchase accounting and some integration costs. So our reported margin might be closer to 14.5% for the year. But we expect over '20 and '21 combined to achieve 150 basis points of total margin improvement we've been talking about for a while. And as we get through '21 to be driving for the next 2 to 3 years, 50-plus basis points for each of the following years after that. 
And so very much on track, if not ahead of track, with where we were at the Investor Day, we had held all the way back in February '19, despite multiple tariff waves and a pandemic. So we feel good about the margin trajectory. And I think, Sue, as we continue to drive market-beating growth and manage our SG&A tightly, we could stay on the higher side of that leverage range."

I'll just add that if you step back a little bit, we set out as a team to really accelerate the flywheel within the business. So investing in core capabilities across the entire platform to generate fuel for growth with the intention that a portion of that would be seen through margin accretion, and a portion of that would be generated to incrementally invest in the business to drive more top line. And once the pandemic hit, we really used it as a platform to accelerate our plans and are delighted with how we've emerged. 
Basically, probably about a year ahead of schedule from where we thought we were. But having made far more incremental investments in the business in 2020 than I think we would have expected at the outset of the year, with plans to continue that in '21 and beyond. 
And so this flywheel really is  working now. And you'll see it through our organic margin, as Pat described, but also through our investment profile as we continue to invest in brand, in innovation, in capacity and in capability in the business."

I do think we go into '21, eyes wide open that we'll have inflation on multiple fronts, material, logistics and labor, but we'll manage it effectively as we have managed considerable tariff inflation the last 3 years. 
And so I don't think we lie awake at night on inflation or think that, that's going to hold us back. In fact, we're committed to drive the margin improvement through that inflation. But I think there will be multiple episodes and some of the timing of that will unfold as we pursue the next couple of years."

So let me take that, and then I'll hand it to Pat to give a little bit more color. But I'll tell you, I mean, firstly, hats off to our team to be able to kind of deliver these quarters of growth, because you're right, it does stretch capacity. And when you drill down and look in pockets of the business where it really was surging and people working literally around the clock to make it happen. 
And so we have been stretched. I think the feedback from customers is more pleased, but they've been very satisfied with the fact that I think we stayed a step ahead of the competition. And that has really helped fuel our share gains, because we've been reliable through this period, notwithstanding the fact that it's taken a lot of work. 
And so we're working hard. And as we built out a plan for '21, we hypersensitized, I would say, to both an upside scenario and a downside scenario. And so in a downside scenario, we're ready to manage the P&L very, very tightly, manage expenses very, very tightly to deliver the kind of margin progression that we were just talking about there with Sue. But we've sensitized on the upside as well, and to the extent that there's upside, we're leaning into capacity investments and inventory to be able to serve the market and capture that upside.
The housing market is undeniably strong. And we don't just view this as a pocket of strength. I mean you go all the way back to the fundamentals. They support this and this expansion is going to have to go on for a long time in order to support it, because we're just fundamentally underbuilt in U.S. housing, and there might be bumps along the way. But over time, this will play out very strongly. And so therefore, we have confidence in leaning in towards that capacity and the capacity investment in inventory because we know that the market needs it. 
Is there any color you want to add?"

So we'll be in the kind of $210 million, $230 million range for CapEx. 
And so it will be going across Decking, Plumbing, Therma-Tru and Cabinets predominantly for entry price points on the coasts. And as Nick said, it will be tight for the first part of the year, but we'll service the demand. Our people are doing a great job utilizing the capacity they have to keep customers happy, and we'll be getting the capacity we need to deliver our growth online effectively."

And I mean, you're looking at something like 5 years now of just consistent market outperformance at increasing margins. And so really phenomenal performance to put up 16 -- in excess of 16% growth in the quarter, just to get into capacity. I mean just the ability to do that alone is impressive. 
But we're feeling really good about it, Phil. I mean firstly, it's been going on for a long time now, right? It's not kind of this one-off. It's been going on for a long time. It was -- to answer question, it was really strong across the board. As you know, retail was very strong, in particular, throughout the year. But as the wholesale channel opened back up, we did see it start to pick up momentum, and we saw that momentum accelerate. 
And by the time we got to the end of the year, we saw healthy growth in every part of that business bar none. I mean it's rare that you get to say that, that it was just everywhere, but it really was everywhere. And hard to service it, whether it be in retail and e-com, in wholesale or in China. The other exciting thing you asked, is there room to go. I mean notwithstanding the fact that the business is able to do that and the business delivered margin in excess of 22%, it also upped its incremental investment significantly. 
So investment in brand was up almost $15 million year-on-year, $10 million in the quarter. I mean that's significant investments in packaging refresh, investments in capabilities like e-commerce and operations as well as things like supply chain, around head count, in our DCs, airfreight to meet a customer demand. And so really putting an investment that sets the business up to continue to grow. And as you step away from that, what do you have, you have this brand that we're investing behind, which is just absolutely refreshed and peaking. Consumers love it. It's #1 for purchase intent. And so we feel really strongly about that. We've invested in the channel and our supply chain capacity. And so we're there to serve. 
And then we're building out these new adjacencies, these future cores of the business and those are starting to really gain traction. And we're seeing it in areas like the smart home, where you've seen the products we've done things like U by Moen. We just won a CES Best of Innovation Winner for U by Moen Smart Faucet. We won some recognition at CES with USA Today's Editor's Choice on our U by Moen smart pump, sump pump monitor, which we just launched. 
What's really exciting though is when you start to tie all that stuff together, what you'll start to see in 2021 is that we're really building out that whole smart home ecosystem. And all of these elements are going to start to talk to each other and be able to do water conservation, freeze protection, vacation modes. And so when you pose that question, do we see room to go? I would say, absolutely. We're performing really well in the core faucets and showerheads. But the business has gotten so good at just leveraging it's kind of twin assets of brand and channel strength to build out these adjacencies.
I think you'll see some near-in adjacencies that will perform in the near-term and then really building out future cores with some of these further out adjacencies that are really starting to gain traction. So we're feeling great. The business has been great under Cheri Phyfer's leadership. And I think given the investments that were made '20 is really just poised to keep doing what it's doing and even see some acceleration from here."

What I wanted to ask you about, though, is closer in, it seems like this year, having a little bit of guidance or maybe some handholding from you all with respect to the sequential progression of sales might be helpful, just given how weird last year obviously was. 
Is there a way that we can think about what we might expect to see or what you all are expecting to see in terms of the sequential trajectory as you progress from 1Q through into the back half of FY '21? Some help -- way that you could help us to envision something like what you're foreseeing?"

Stephen, it's a tricky business even for those of us here who watch kind of the daily order flow in shipments. I think what we could say is, obviously, from our results, the fourth quarter finished very strongly, right? We delivered double-digit growth across all the lines of business. And you saw that in POS as much as you saw in shipments. We're still kind of in a mode where we're largely shipping to POS at this point. 
And I think that will continue through a good part of the first quarter to half of the year. And the POS momentum from the fourth quarter has largely carried into the opening month of this year and doesn't seem to be abating. So we would definitely expect double-digit growth for the first quarter at least, and that could easily continue into the second quarter given last year you were shut down for at least about half of the quarter. And then we'll see where it goes from there. 
I think when we looked at understanding a market and setting guidance for the full year, you see some pretty wide goalpost on external data for U.S. R&R and U.S. new construction. As you noticed, we come out on, but I think the bullish side of it because we think that this is underpinned by fundamental demographics and other drivers of the macro that are not just episodic here. And so we'll see if the back half of the year is kind of flat to low single-digit growth or it gets a lot better. 
I think there's a good chance that it gets better than that. But I kind of guide you towards double-digit growth to start the year, and then we'll update you as appropriately. We don't typically give quarterly guidance, but I think what we're seeing this early part of the year is the same POS strength we saw at the end of the year."

And so those are sort of proper comps. So to kind of put up the growth that we put out and seen with POS that we saw in Q4 gives us a good degree of confidence. The fact that we've carried that momentum, that exit momentum right into what we're seeing now in January, makes us feel pretty good that there's a very solid market there on top of solid comps from the prior year."

I wanted to -- second question I had relates to the Cabinets business specifically. We think of it as primarily kitchen and bath cabinetry, and yet, one of the interesting things with the pandemic and the working from home is that people, I'm guessing, that certain population and probably one that you can cater to well would be considering maybe converting rooms to more permanent work-from-home space as opposed to something ad hoc and just throwing it together, getting something from IKEA. 
And in that regard, I'm wondering how much of your business in the Cabinet segment has historically been outside of kitchen and bath? And I'm thinking it would probably be primarily home-office type setups. And where do you think that can go?"

We don't sort of track it by -- tightly by rooms outside of kitchen and bath. But what I will say is the team there is very -- is actually very focused on adjacencies and areas for growth as part of their strategic plan. But it's also being absolutely prioritized about the way in which they're going to go after things, right? 
So first and foremost, is kind of dedication to the margin journey that we're on and making sure that we are absolutely able to hit that. And again, you see the exit rate here for Q4 and even the exit rate that Pat referenced for the second half at 11.9%, very satisfied with how they're tracking. And they're not satisfied, though, to sit on that. They're working very hard to say what's the journey time, the team's objective and even beyond it. So that's our priority #1. 
Priority #2 is capturing the share from the imports. And they've done a phenomenal job of that. And if you look at the imports, while some of that has flowed back, it is at a much higher AUP than was previously, right? So less volume, higher price. That's absolutely the landscape in which we want to compete, which is an even playing field. And so we're competing there and winning. And then from there, I'd say it's new channels and new products. And so new channels, there's a lot of opportunity in e-commerce. We're starting to see that come to fruition and investing behind the opportunity there. And then adjacencies. 
So areas like other rooms. Is there expansion beyond the kitchen where other areas or other vanities. And so that's the order of priority. I'd say that they're attacking these things. And we'll get off of them. And I think as we do, you're going to see both the margin progression that we're absolutely committed to delivering, but also because of what you touched on as well as some of the other areas, I've touched on, there'll be some really nice growth as well."

I would say on the Decking side, we've got a capacity plan, and we're kind of working through our capacity plan and then we will try to work an upside plan for that capacity plan to the extent that we're able to bring that upside plan to fruition or see more pricing momentum on Decking, which I think that sector probably merits. There's some upside there. 
And then I think in Doors, there may well be certainly, if the momentum that we're seeing continues, and it's really both wholesale and retail. So it's not just new construction part, but in retail as well. Then we would see it there as well. We were somewhat cautious as we built the plan around just the strength of what we saw towards the end of the year, both in Doors and in our LARSON acquisition. And so we want to kind of progress through the first quarter, and see how that's going. 
But again, the momentum in both of those businesses, like we touched on Plumbing and Cabinets has continued to be very strong and has maintained its velocity coming out the back end of the year. And so I don't disagree with you. I think we put together a prudent plan, and we are still cognizant of the fact that there is pandemic and economic uncertainty out in the world, and we want to manage the P&L very tightly. But we're gearing the business and the capacity to the upside there. And I think you touched on a couple of areas in which it could happen. 
And then just turning to your question on Security. I fully agree with you. We would like to see more growth. Now you had a couple things, a couple dynamics in the year. You had on the retail side of business, you had a back-to-school season that just didn't happen, right? We saw a lot of [indiscernible] and things like that. And you had a commercial channel where we'd go in, really, and do a consultative sale with factories and facilities that shut down in Q2 and stayed shut down throughout the rest of the year. 
We actually exited the fourth quarter with really nice growth in retail in the double digits. And so we were really encouraged by that. And where we got the business squarely focused is on getting the product assortment right, getting the supply chain absolutely set, getting the category management capabilities in and once all that is set, and we made some really good progress and invested for it in 2020, then we're going to start to turn the dial harder on things like innovation, which should then start to raise the top line. 
And so we wanted to be very deliberate about that progression, getting that core right, getting the operations and supply chain absolutely stable and healthy and producing, and then kind of turning that dial on growth. Although even given that, we were happy to see retail, which is the biggest part of the business, power along as it did at the end of the quarter."

Mike, I think just to add to what Nick was saying, I think he hit on the key points. I think there is potential upside to both Doors and decking. I think in decking, the hit on it, it's the pace of our capacity plan and the pricing dynamics in the marketplace, those things could lend upside if they go faster than we are expecting. 
And then Doors, think of the Doors business is probably the 1 business we have that's closer to 50-50 new construction and R&R as opposed to most of our portfolio's about 2/3 or more R&R. And as you recall, our outlook on U.S. new construction is 10% to 12%, I think there's upside to Doors to the extent that builders can pace completions closer to their order flow. 
Our market outlook is really predicated on about 100,000 unit growth in U.S. housing, but that's about 110 to 100 of -- I'm sorry, that's 100 to 110 of new construction -- single-family new construction housing growth and a decline in multifamily for a total of about 75,000 units across the two. So I think it really gets down to kind of the pacing of completions in single-family pickup, and that will help drive that business. 
And then to Nick's point on Security is can we get a real back-to-school season? Can we get the industrial markets opened up as consultants are allowed in factories and get innovation going in that business. Those are the things."

I appreciate that. And just wanted to circle back to a prior question around cadence throughout the year and very much appreciate the talk around the top line, where you're saying double-digit top line growth likely to continue into the first quarter, possibly the second. It sounded like by contrast, just again at this point of the year, and obviously, the way the numbers would work, flat to up low single digits, which is still very impressive, obviously, given the tough comps and I think most people would be some -- many people would be thinking perhaps it would be down a little bit. 
So I just want to make sure I heard that right that at this point in the game, as you look at your plans, you're looking for flat to maybe up slightly in the back half? And what that means for EPS distribution? Typically, during the year, you have anywhere from 40% to 45% or so of EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 55%, 60% in the back half. I would almost think this year that would flip. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that."

I'll give you some perspective, and then Pat will speak a little bit to the numbers. But I would say, firstly, just kind of step back from a market perspective, we're very fortunate the 2 most favorable housing markets in the world, the U.S. and China markets, right? And that's where you see the most growth and the most opportunity. And China is sort of the rare market that is not only growing quickly, but also is quite fragmented. 
And so there's still an opportunity to build a lot of share over time. And our business there has been built organically over a long time with a homegrown team that has out-executed that market and now is very focused not on just out executing the top line, but driving profit and driving leverage through the P&L. As much just as good discipline to be able to reinvest in the business for the long run, as a profit driver for us overall, it's really more -- we want that business to be disciplined and to be healthy and be able to to continue to drive itself. And so they've grown incredibly quickly, and the focus has really been on leveraging our brand and channel position into new product adjacencies and new channel adjacencies. 
And I think they do it better than anybody in our business. They really kind of are our North Star for the rest of Fortune Brands in their approach. When you look at the more recent performance, it's continued to power on. We obviously saw the shutdown around Chinese new year and then continue on. As you know, the Chinese economy actually did pretty well, grew a bit over 2% for the year. So pretty impressive. And we're calculating or basing sort of somewhere between 6, maybe a bit more. 
Where we continue to see strength throughout the year was really in the developer side of the business and in the e-commerce side of the business. Showrooms were slower as people were still cautious to head out. But we have a leading share in developer, so we were very excited about that, and developers continue to build. And bear in mind, we're really prioritized on Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. So we're not really exposed to the big speculative buildings and the empty cities that you hear about. We're really big share in Shanghai and other densely populated areas where people are either moving in or upgrading their living circumstances. 
And so we're very bullish on the opportunity in China. Housing continues to be a fundamentally important part of that country's economy, and so we don't see that backing down. And then within housing, we're out executing, and we're out executing with a homegrown team that really knows how to build out the Moen brand and the House of ROHL brands into even broader adjacencies and how to build out new channels and new channel partners. 
And while we've been doing this, actually in 2020, we raised our, let's say, an incremental investment in that business and really started folding the pull behind the brands, not just the push model that we've done really well with over time. And the early read on the brand metrics have been extremely strong. And so we're very excited about China. We think over the long term, it could be a really nice play for our company. We don't necessarily bank on it in any given year, but we've just grown it slowly -- or not so slowly, but I'd say, over a long period of time, to the point where now it's a significant player in that market and can be a significant growth contributor for us."

The first half and the second half were both kind of high teens quarter. 
So there's a very consistent drumbeat there of growth in large part. I think if there's 1 part of our business, and Nick hit on it, that's probably driving innovation at the most rapid pace and with the greatest level of success, including into adjacent categories and finding growth across multiple channels and doing it profitably in that market as well. It's just a -- the talent on the ground we have there is ever bit as strong as the talent we have across the globe, and they're doing an amazing job."

Recall, firstly, we never counted on government assistance to help us. We set about pivoting the portfolio to really aim at the heart of that market like what was working there anyway and adjusted our portfolio to really target that heart of the market. But then we were successful in the anti-dumping suit. And the purpose of that really was to get rid of illegal subsidies and unfair composition. It wasn't to close the board and all imports. And we're happy to import -- we're happy to compete against other low-cost countries, and we feel not only we set up to compete, we're set up to win. 
And I think that's what's now playing out. And so as you've seen, those imports start to migrate to other countries. And by the way, a lot of that is illegal transshipping. And I think customs is going to be all over that. But you're seeing it come across at a higher cost, either because it truly is manufactured in another country. So average selling price out of Vietnam is more than 2x what the China AUP is or it's being illegally transshipped, but frankly, moving stuff from 1 country to another and trying to evade customs has a cost to it, that's being reflected in the marketplace. 
And so I'm sure you're seeing it through your channel checks. But you go to the channel checks. You'll hear that imports are still struggling from a supply chain perspective, lead times are long and pricing is up. And that is a very favorable backdrop for which for us to compete. And that's why it's 1 of the reasons why we're not seeing growth across the board, even though you could argue on a dollar perspective, those imports are kind of probably at a dollar level where they were prior to the run-up of inventory with the duties coming on. 
The playing field is level and the business is competing well. And that's the only outcome we could have hoped for. And again, not trying to shut a Board, we're just trying to have a level playing field. And it's had the necessary impact. We will, however, continue to aggressively investigate or help pursue anybody who cheats and there's going to be cheating happening, but it happens with enough incremental cost, but I think it's leveled out the playing field enough. Pat, you want to touch on the margin."

And so if you really look at the back half margin of that business, which is 11.9%, I think it's more indicative of kind of where they're running at these days. And you hit out 1 of the levers to kind of get this farther up the margin chain and more towards that mid teens. 
I think there's room to go on both the stock and the make-to-order side of the businesses. We'll deal with inflation in our Cabinet business as we do in all of our businesses. We'll take continuous cost improvement and supply chain actions that were necessary price to drive improvement offsets inflation. And then I think getting leveraged to get further margin expansion, there's still a lot of growth on the asset and SG&A base and stock and also, I would say, during '20, we were repurposing some older capacity on the fly and still are in the early parts of this year, that is not the optimal way to service demand. We're doing that just because the demand is so strong. So there's still some footprint optimization to go in the stock business. 
And then I think we did a lot of hard work to standardize product and rightsize the semi-custom and premium make-to-order businesses. A, there's still some more standardization opportunity out there. And all the hard work to rightsize those businesses, and now that those businesses are growing, you're going to see in '21 and beyond, the ability to leverage the tough restructuring work that the teams have been doing for the 2 years in that business. So I think you're going to see both stock and make-to-order contributing to growth from this point forward. 
I think what you haven't seen and really until the back half of this year is on the stock side. You still had so many things moving to service demand. You weren't seeing the optimal long-term cost structure for the stock side, and you were still seeing decline in make-to-order. And it's only now that we're seeing the stock gets closer to its end game, and we're seeing growth in make-to-order to leverage that resized business. 
So I think there's good opportunity ahead for both of them. And we're wide eyed to the competition. As Nick said, we built a better mousetrap. We're not looking for the government to give that business margin and that business is demonstrating that it can compete for share and turn it into margin accretion."

I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe. I could not be prouder of what we achieved in 2020, our strong fourth quarter results capped a remarkable full year performance by our teams. Facing unprecedented challenges, we drove market-beating growth and delivered on our margin expansion strategy ahead of schedule.
During the year, we deployed over $1 billion in capital towards M&A, share buybacks and dividends, generated excellent free cash flow and exited the year with attractive leverage. And amidst all of this activity, our teams worked tirelessly to keep consumers and customers supplied while maintaining industry-leading safety performance and has truly been an extraordinary year. 
All of our businesses saw impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. And we drove margin improvement in each segment by delivering against strong demand for our leading brands and leveraging our efficiency programs. Importantly, this past year, we also made critical long-term investments in our brands, innovation, Fortune Brands' core capabilities and supply chain capacity that will enable us to capture future opportunities and accelerate our share gains.
Over the last 8 quarters, we have shown that we can deliver results and create value for our stakeholders in a variety of market conditions. We are positioned to capture growth as the market accelerates and are structured to tightly manage our P&L in times of slower expansion. With the initiatives that we've undertaken, the investments that we have made, and momentum that we are seeing, we expect even stronger sales and profit growth as we enter 2021.
Looking forward, we are in the early stages of a long-term expansion of U.S. housing. As has been widely noted, the extent to which U.S. housing has been underbuilt is several multiples greater than the overbuilding of the mid-2000s. And yet, new construction starts are far short of their peak and only now reaching historic averages. Low supply and high demand, coupled with favorable demographics and low interest rates have unleashed delayed momentum into our marketplace. Given the low inventory of housing, this momentum impacts both new construction and repair and remodel activity as the aging housing supply requires renovation. Given supply side constraints, we expect this momentum to play out over several years.
Turning to 2021. We are well positioned to take advantage of this expanding housing market. We've done a lot to replatform the business, to be even more efficient and agile and will continue to do more in the year ahead. While economic and pandemic uncertainties still exist, we will stay flexible and nimble and manage the business very tightly. We expect to capture increasing opportunities in this market and have scenario planned for challenges that could arise.
The last 8 quarters have demonstrated that we can excel in playing offense and defense and can deliver for shareholders in a variety of market environments. We are well positioned and are very excited for the year ahead.
I want to thank all of our dedicated team members who continue to work so hard to keep our people safe and our facilities operating. I am so proud of our teams, who are not only caring for each other, but who are doing so while serving strong demand for home products. Our people are the foundation upon which our business is built, and they drove our outstanding results in 2020.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our fourth quarter and full year results as well as discuss our key initiatives and how we expect to evolve over time. And then Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as our thoughts around our future financial performance expectations for 2021. 
Now turning to our view on the housing market. As I've mentioned, long-term fundamentals continue to be very favorable for housing and home products. U.S. housing is currently substantially underbuilt, and we are uniquely positioned with our brands and channels to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity.
Additionally, the key millennial generation has accelerated their delayed move towards household formation and are showing increased interest in homeownership. Pandemic or no pandemic, this generation's move towards household formation had to happen as they form families and we simply lack the housing stock to support it. Moreover, increased workplace flexibility has allowed many younger homeowners to leverage technology allowed for larger homes further from urban cores. Multifunctional spaces within the home as well as increased trends towards entertaining at home and outdoor living are accelerating new home buying and remodeling.
New construction activity has remained strong since the latter half of 2019, except during a brief COVID shutdown driven by very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates, and is showing no signs of slowing down. The strength of our new construction channel gives us exposure to excellent growth as builders work to meet the significant demand. 
Repair and remodel activity remains very strong as consumers continue their focus on home improvement and spending to refurbish older homes. With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventory is being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. Additionally, with home values on the rise as well as homeowner balance sheet strength and home equity levels at or near all-time highs, we expect R&R on our activity through 2021 and beyond. We believe our advantaged mix of exposure to the stable repair and remodel market, combined with the torque of a strong new construction market gives us an unparalleled opportunity to add long-term value for our stakeholders. 
Given current market fundamentals, including very favorable demographics, low inventory and an aged housing stock, we see a very positive multiyear tailwind powering the U.S. housing market to consistent mid-single-digit R&R growth and high single-digit single-family new construction growth, which could be even higher in the near term. Consistent with our long history, we intend to outperform any market conditions that materialize.
As we have demonstrated over the last 2 years, our ability to capture the upside afforded by new construction exposure as well as effectively manage periods of softer demand and for when market conditions change, uniquely positions us to drive both growth and margins with a portfolio of leading brands and advantaged channel positions.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total sales increased approximately 13% over last year, and operating margin increased to 14.8%. This performance was the result of exceptional operational execution in a strong market, while our teams continue to serve robust demand. We drove solid margin improvement as we saw the continued benefit of our efficiency programs implemented in early 2020.
Consistent with our strategy, our fuel for growth program allowed us to invest heavily in key growth initiatives, including the Moen brand, innovation, decking capacity and distribution rollout and value-priced cabinetry capacity. We also continue to invest in replatforming our business through advantaged Fortune Brands' common core competencies, including complexity reduction, category management and global supply chain management. We are accelerating investments in our most critical priorities as we position for continued growth in 2021 and for the longer term.
Importantly, these cost company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule as reflected in our 2020 results, and will continue to compound in 2021 and beyond. We will continue to drive a common set of capabilities to fuel growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses, and how we are positioning to be even stronger long term. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets, with sales up mid-teens in the quarter and operating margins of 21.8%. We experienced strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Plumbing investments in marketing and innovation continue to fuel remarkable results. Our Global Plumbing Group's ability to pursue growth in both core and adjacencies is creating new opportunities for this business to continue producing market-leading growth. Our sustained investment in brand, newer channels such as e-commerce as well as an on-trend innovation sets GPG up for continued long-term success.
We also achieved solid growth in China during the fourth quarter. Moen continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, driving excellent leverage to the bottom line. In China, housing continues to be an important overall component of economic growth and the Chinese economy.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased double digits and operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 15.8%. These exceptional results were driven by double-digit decking and doors growth, a return to growth in security and strong segment operating performance. Importantly, our Fiberon decking brand continued to grow in excess of 30%, notwithstanding the lapping of product load-ins ahead of distribution gains in Q4 of 2019. Decking momentum continues to benefit from our distribution wins and execution as we position the brand for long-term growth in a market fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials.
The pandemic has accelerated consumers' focus on outdoor living, and we are seeing continued strong demand for our products. Our distribution wins and capacity expansion plans remain on track. We had incremental capacity come online in the fourth quarter and will expand further at multiple points in time throughout 2021.
To further capture the momentum in outdoor living and leverage opportunities as the market leader in exterior door products, we added LARSON to our Outdoors and Security business. LARSON is the market leader in storm and security doors and is a perfect fit with our exterior door products and outdoor living portfolio of leading brands. It is a high-performing business with a phenomenal team and best-in-class products and customer relationships. We're off to a great start with LARSON and are excited to accelerate value creation with advantage to Fortune Brands' core competencies and synergistic portfolio.
Sales in our legacy Doors brands experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity from distribution wins. The synergies and scale emerging from our shared wholesale distribution for doors and decking has been particularly advantageous to 2020 share gains.
Turning to Security. Sales returned to growth with retail producing double-digit growth and commercial markets remaining soft as the sales channel remained largely closed. We are continuing to innovate in our security product lines with touchless and connected products for residential and commercial applications and feel good about the progress that the business is making under its new leadership.
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales increased low double digits with growth across product lines at all price points, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points over last year to 11.6%. This past year, the business has demonstrated how our pivot plan has worked, producing outperformance across vastly different market environments under extremely challenging conditions. After more than 2 years of aggressive repositioning, this business is now squarely centered on the heart of the market and has proven it can achieve and sustain share gains with leverage through the P&L, producing higher margins. 
The make-to-order market has returned to solid growth with the stabilization of imports and the rise in home sales and remodeling activity. The streamlining of our make-to-order business is now delivering, and we are being rewarded with incremental business from our advantaged dealer network. We continue to further optimize the supply chain to prepare for growth at higher margins over the next few years.
Within our value price point cabinets, we continue to gain share from both domestic players and from the absence of Chinese suppliers, who've exited the market over the past few months or who've been replaced to a lesser extent, with other importers with higher costs and longer lead times. Our advantaged low-cost country supply chain is competing and winning against domestic competitors and higher costing imports. 
Our Cabinets team has succeeded in repositioning products to win in the market and has improved the cost structure of the business. More opportunities lie ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same aggressiveness and tenacity demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid teens margins.
In summary, 2020 was an unprecedented year that has reshaped many facets of our society. And also shown a bright light on the value of the home and the role it plays in people's lives. We're proud to work towards our purpose of fulfilling dreams of home, now more than ever. Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and lower supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for housing. With our excellent teams, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are perfectly positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders.
As we continue to outperform the strong home products market, we are accelerating our journey to improve operating margins and are ahead of schedule. While the immediate economic outlook and pandemic environment remain uncertain and supply chains and cost inflation may introduce some volatility, we have proven our ability to perform in a variety of market conditions. We will continue to operate the business with focus and agility while investing in key strategic initiatives to deliver excellent long-term results for stakeholders. 
Our teams yet again delivered excellent results in a challenging environment. We remain focused on keeping our people safe and serving our customers. We're investing for the long-term and continue to demonstrate that this business model and management team have multiple pods to increasing growth and profitability. We're excited to be in the early innings of a multiyear expansion in U.S. housing. While we are far from prior peaks in housing activity, our business is growing stronger and it has more scale than at any prior time in its history. 
As the market expands to fill the much-needed demand for U.S. housing, we expect to scale with that demand and continue to take share, consistent with our track record. Our portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market is more innovative and has broader channel exposure than ever.  Combined with our own actions to continuously improve the business and our proven resilience, we are uniquely positioned to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion, while managing any volatility that may come our way.
Our 2021 outlook, which Pat will speak to in greater detail, reflects the strength of our business, with robust growth translating to excellent profit leverage, while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond. In addition, our balance sheet is strong and positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for what our world-class brands and people can accomplish. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"

Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year a",1681,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.
Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.66 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $246 million, up 19% or $40 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 70 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.25 for the quarter, up 25% versus $1 for the same quarter last year. Our associates focused on safety and on serving our customers during challenging circumstances made these remarkable results possible. 
Our teams used the circumstances of 2020 to enhance focus, improving share competitiveness and cost efficiency, driving 2020 growth and accelerating our margin improvement trajectory, providing an excellent 2021 setup. Our advantage business model with leading brands and channel positions allowed us to navigate 2020's uncertainties to outperform the markets in which we operate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $638 million, up $89 million or 16% or up 15% adjusting for FX. Fourth quarter growth was strong double digits across all major products, channels and geographies. Full year 2020 sales were up almost 9% versus 2019. 
Plumbing operating income increased 17% to $139 million for the current quarter. Operating income for the full year was $490 million, an increase of 12% over 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.8% and over 22% for the full year. Our Global Plumbing Group concluded its fifth straight year of strong growth and margin performance. Our strategies are clearly working, and we expect another strong year for Plumbing in 2021.
Now turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the fourth quarter were $367 million, up $35 million or 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Doors and Decking and a return to growth in Security. Full year 2020 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of over 5% versus the prior year. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth, with particular strength continuing in Doors and Decking. Door sales were up double digits in the fourth quarter, driven by strong retail POS and accelerating single-family new construction. We expect sales growth to continue in 2021 as both retail and new construction remains strong.
Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. We added incremental capacity during the quarter and more capacity will come online in 2021. The secular trends favoring composite decking remain as strong as ever. Security sales returned to growth in the quarter with retail products growing double digits, while commercial products and markets remained soft due to COVID 19.
Outdoors & Securities segment operating income was $58 million during the quarter, up 17% over the same quarter last year, driven by operating improvement in Doors and Decking. Operating income for the full year was $205 million, an increase of approximately 16% versus 2019. Segment operating margin for Outdoors & Security increased 90 basis points for the quarter over last year to 15.8% and was 14.5% for the full year, up 130 basis points versus 2019.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the fourth quarter were $656 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2019. Full year 2020 sales were $2.5 billion, up 3.4%. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to growth this quarter, a positive signal for big ticket R&R and reflective of the stabilization of imports and consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. 
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $76 million, up 27% or $16 million versus the prior year, and full year operating income was $256 million, up 11% or $26 million versus 2019. Operating margin for the quarter was 11.6% and 10.4% for the full year, up 150 and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. 
Full year cabinet's margin performance was very strong, given big ticket R&R, inclusive of Cabinets, experienced the most severe demand and operating impacts during the second quarter COVID shutdown. We are very pleased with Cabinet's second half margin performance of 11.9% and strong year-end exit rate. We expect Cabinet's operating margin improvement to continue in 2021 as we build on our efforts in 2020 to further enact operational efficiencies and aggressively leverage our market-beating growth.
For FBHS as a whole, to sum up our full year consolidated 2020 performance, sales increased approximately 6% to over $6 billion for the first time ever as a public company. EPS grew over 16% to $4.19, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement by outperforming the markets in which we operate in an increasingly efficient manner. Our total company operating margin was up 80 basis points to 14.1%, ahead of our full year 2020 plan.
Free cash flow was $742 million, reflecting a conversion rate of 126%. 2021 profit growth will benefit from the efficiency programs initiated in 2020 and the continuation of a strong U.S. housing market. This will result in positive operating leverage across the company as we continue to enact Fortune Brands' core capabilities across the portfolio.
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on expected signs of material and cost inflation in the face of current elevated demand and amid a backdrop of a fundamentally strong housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our business. We do this through continuous cost improvement within our operations, having enacted major improvements just within the past year. 
We also employ cost-sharing with suppliers where appropriate and continuously look for ways to add flexibility and durability to our global supply chain. Finally, when necessary, we act via pricing. Through this combination of actions, we expect to navigate 2021 inflation and achieve our margin improvement objectives. We will mitigate, offset and overcome inflationary headwind and deliver our goals of market beating growth and continued margin expansion.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $419 million, net debt of $2.2 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ended the year at 2.1x or slightly below 2x on a pro forma basis, inclusive of LARSON EBITDA. We now have $865 million of total liquidity available between our $1.25 billion revolver and supplemental $400 million revolver. We have the ability to make investments and deploy capital to accelerate growth and shareholder value creation and are assessing opportunities to do so. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through targeted buybacks and our dividend.
Turning to the details of our outlook for 2021. Based on the global market for our products growing 5% to 7%, with the U.S. housing market also growing 5% to 7%, and within this market forecast, we expect U.S. new construction growth of 10% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 4% to 6%. Based on those assumptions, we expect 2021 full year sales growth of 12.5% to 14.5% or 5.5% to 7.5%, excluding LARSON. We expect full year EPS within the range of $4.85 to $5.05 on a before-charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to 18% EPS growth versus 2020.
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan. Plumbing net sales growth of 7% to 9%, with operating margins of 22 plus percent. Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 35% to 37% or 5% to 7% ex LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14% to 15%, or approximately 15% to 16%, adjusting for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses. 
Cabinets net sales growth of 5% to 7% with operating margins of 11% to 12%. We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $600 million to $650 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $92 million to $93 million; interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million; a tax rate between 24.5% and 25%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 140 million to 141 million.  
To summarize, we have put together a 2021 plan that provides solid sales and excellent EPS growth, while we continue to accelerate investments in brand, innovation and advantaged Fortune Brands capabilities. Potential exists for upside to our plan and guidance if some combination of the following occurs. Labor is available to address in full the strong expected U.S. new construction and big ticket R&R demand; if U.S. R&R growth improves beyond the 4% to 6% assumed in our plan; government stimulus increases materially beyond programs currently in place without impacting interest rates. Better insight to these opportunities will unfold during the first half. As this occurs and as merited, we will refine our guidance accordingly. 
We expect a long runway of fundamental U.S. housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. With market growth averaging 5-plus percent per year over the next few years, assuming the current level of unemployment continues to stabilize then improves. We expect our sales to continue outperforming the market and our margin progression to remain accelerated, averaging improvement above 50 basis points in 2021 in each of the next 2 to 3 years.
Our balance sheet strength supports capital deployment and while we delivered over $1 billion in M&A, share repurchases and dividends in 2020, we are still advantageously positioned to assess further opportunities to deploy capital. We see multiple paths to value creation to execute for our shareholders, and our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. Our teams remain committed to driving market-beating sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.

And Pat, I know that you laid out some of the factors that you're kind of thinking about that could impact where you end up for this year, but can you kind of outline for us maybe some of the things that could take you to the higher end of that 20% or 30% range?

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while.

In terms of margin overall, Sue, I'd start with, we remain committed to getting the total business above 15%, which is the target we've had for a while. And on an organic basis, next year, we'll be very much approaching that. We should be at 15% or very close to it on an organic basis by the end of next year, which means on an organic basis, we'll be driving 70 to 80 basis points of margin improvement, if not more, and be on the higher side of that incremental margin. 
We do -- as we fold LARSON into the business, we have some purchase accounting and some integration costs. So our reported margin might be closer to 14.5% for the year. But we expect over '20 and '21 combined to achieve 150 basis points of total margin improvement we've been talking about for a while. And as we get through '21 to be driving for the next 2 to 3 years, 50-plus basis points for each of the following years after that. 
And so very much on track, if not ahead of track, with where we were at the Investor Day, we had held all the way back in February '19, despite multiple tariff waves and a pandemic. So we feel good about the margin trajectory. And I think, Sue, as we continue to drive market-beating growth and manage our SG&A tightly, we could stay on the higher side of that leverage range."

I'll just add that if you step back a little bit, we set out as a team to really accelerate the flywheel within the business. So investing in core capabilities across the entire platform to generate fuel for growth with the intention that a portion of that would be seen through margin accretion, and a portion of that would be generated to incrementally invest in the business to drive more top line. And once the pandemic hit, we really used it as a platform to accelerate our plans and are delighted with how we've emerged. 
Basically, probably about a year ahead of schedule from where we thought we were. But having made far more incremental investments in the business in 2020 than I think we would have expected at the outset of the year, with plans to continue that in '21 and beyond. 
And so this flywheel really is  working now. And you'll see it through our organic margin, as Pat described, but also through our investment profile as we continue to invest in brand, in innovation, in capacity and in capability in the business."

And so I don't think we lie awake at night on inflation or think that, that's going to hold us back. In fact, we're committed to drive the margin improvement through that inflation. But I think there will be multiple episodes and some of the timing of that will unfold as we pursue the next couple of years."

So let me take that, and then I'll hand it to Pat to give a little bit more color.

So let me take that, and then I'll hand it to Pat to give a little bit more color. But I'll tell you, I mean, firstly, hats off to our team to be able to kind of deliver these quarters of growth, because you're right, it does stretch capacity. And when you drill down and look in pockets of the business where it really was surging and people working literally around the clock to make it happen. 
And so we have been stretched. I think the feedback from customers is more pleased, but they've been very satisfied with the fact that I think we stayed a step ahead of the competition. And that has really helped fuel our share gains, because we've been reliable through this period, notwithstanding the fact that it's taken a lot of work. 
And so we're working hard. And as we built out a plan for '21, we hypersensitized, I would say, to both an upside scenario and a downside scenario. And so in a downside scenario, we're ready to manage the P&L very, very tightly, manage expenses very, very tightly to deliver the kind of margin progression that we were just talking about there with Sue. But we've sensitized on the upside as well, and to the extent that there's upside, we're leaning into capacity investments and inventory to be able to serve the market and capture that upside.
The housing market is undeniably strong. And we don't just view this as a pocket of strength. I mean you go all the way back to the fundamentals. They support this and this expansion is going to have to go on for a long time in order to support it, because we're just fundamentally underbuilt in U.S. housing, and there might be bumps along the way. But over time, this will play out very strongly. And so therefore, we have confidence in leaning in towards that capacity and the capacity investment in inventory because we know that the market needs it. 
Is there any color you want to add?"

So we're delighted with Plumbing. And I mean, you're looking at something like 5 years now of just consistent market outperformance at increasing margins. And so really phenomenal performance to put up 16 -- in excess of 16% growth in the quart",633,"Yes, sure. So we're delighted with Plumbing. And I mean, you're looking at something like 5 years now of just consistent market outperformance at increasing margins. And so really phenomenal performance to put up 16 -- in excess of 16% growth in the quarter, just to get into capacity. I mean just the ability to do that alone is impressive. 
But we're feeling really good about it, Phil. I mean firstly, it's been going on for a long time now, right? It's not kind of this one-off. It's been going on for a long time. It was -- to answer question, it was really strong across the board. As you know, retail was very strong, in particular, throughout the year. But as the wholesale channel opened back up, we did see it start to pick up momentum, and we saw that momentum accelerate. 
And by the time we got to the end of the year, we saw healthy growth in every part of that business bar none. I mean it's rare that you get to say that, that it was just everywhere, but it really was everywhere. And hard to service it, whether it be in retail and e-com, in wholesale or in China. The other exciting thing you asked, is there room to go. I mean notwithstanding the fact that the business is able to do that and the business delivered margin in excess of 22%, it also upped its incremental investment significantly. 
So investment in brand was up almost $15 million year-on-year, $10 million in the quarter. I mean that's significant investments in packaging refresh, investments in capabilities like e-commerce and operations as well as things like supply chain, around head count, in our DCs, airfreight to meet a customer demand. And so really putting an investment that sets the business up to continue to grow. And as you step away from that, what do you have, you have this brand that we're investing behind, which is just absolutely refreshed and peaking. Consumers love it. It's #1 for purchase intent. And so we feel really strongly about that. We've invested in the channel and our supply chain capacity. And so we're there to serve. 
And then we're building out these new adjacencies, these future cores of the business and those are starting to really gain traction. And we're seeing it in areas like the smart home, where you've seen the products we've done things like U by Moen. We just won a CES Best of Innovation Winner for U by Moen Smart Faucet. We won some recognition at CES with USA Today's Editor's Choice on our U by Moen smart pump, sump pump monitor, which we just launched. 
What's really exciting though is when you start to tie all that stuff together, what you'll start to see in 2021 is that we're really building out that whole smart home ecosystem. And all of these elements are going to start to talk to each other and be able to do water conservation, freeze protection, vacation modes. And so when you pose that question, do we see room to go? I would say, absolutely. We're performing really well in the core faucets and showerheads. But the business has gotten so good at just leveraging it's kind of twin assets of brand and channel strength to build out these adjacencies.
I think you'll see some near-in adjacencies that will perform in the near-term and then really building out future cores with some of these further out adjacencies that are really starting to gain traction. So we're feeling great. The business has been great under Cheri Phyfer's leadership. And I think given the investments that were made '20 is really just poised to keep doing what it's doing and even see some acceleration from here."

What I wanted to ask you about, though, is closer in, it seems like this year, having a little bit of guidance or maybe some handholding from you all with respect to the sequential progression of sales might be helpful, just given how weird last year obviously was. 
Is there a way that we can think about what we might expect to see or what you all are expecting to see in terms of the sequential trajectory as you progress from 1Q through into the back half of FY '21? Some help -- way that you could help us to envision something like what you're foreseeing?"

Stephen, it's a tricky business even for those of us here who watch kind of the daily order flow in shipments. I think what we could say is, obviously, from our results, the fourth quarter finished very strongly, right? We delivered double-digit growth across all the lines of business. And you saw that in POS as much as you saw in shipments. We're still kind of in a mode where we're largely shipping to POS at this point. 
And I think that will continue through a good part of the first quarter to half of the year. And the POS momentum from the fourth quarter has largely carried into the opening month of this year and doesn't seem to be abating. So we would definitely expect double-digit growth for the first quarter at least, and that could easily continue into the second quarter given last year you were shut down for at least about half of the quarter. And then we'll see where it goes from there. 
I think when we looked at understanding a market and setting guidance for the full year, you see some pretty wide goalpost on external data for U.S. R&R and U.S. new construction. As you noticed, we come out on, but I think the bullish side of it because we think that this is underpinned by fundamental demographics and other drivers of the macro that are not just episodic here. And so we'll see if the back half of the year is kind of flat to low single-digit growth or it gets a lot better. 
I think there's a good chance that it gets better than that. But I kind of guide you towards double-digit growth to start the year, and then we'll update you as appropriately. We don't typically give quarterly guidance, but I think what we're seeing this early part of the year is the same POS strength we saw at the end of the year."

And so those are sort of proper comps. So to kind of put up the growth that we put out and seen with POS that we saw in Q4 gives us a good degree of confidence. The fact that we've carried that momentum, that exit momentum right into what we're seeing now in January, makes us feel pretty good that there's a very solid market there on top of solid comps from the prior year."

I wanted to -- second question I had relates to the Cabinets business specifically. We think of it as primarily kitchen and bath cabinetry, and yet, one of the interesting things with the pandemic and the working from home is that people, I'm guessing, that certain population and probably one that you can cater to well would be considering maybe converting rooms to more permanent work-from-home space as opposed to something ad hoc and just throwing it together, getting something from IKEA. 
And in that regard, I'm wondering how much of your business in the Cabinet segment has historically been outside of kitchen and bath? And I'm thinking it would probably be primarily home-office type setups. And where do you think that can go?"

We don't sort of track it by -- tightly by rooms outside of kitchen and bath. But what I will say is the team there is very -- is actually very focused on adjacencies and areas for growth as part of their strategic plan. But it's also being absolutely prioritized about the way in which they're going to go after things, right? 
So first and foremost, is kind of dedication to the margin journey that we're on and making sure that we are absolutely able to hit that. And again, you see the exit rate here for Q4 and even the exit rate that Pat referenced for the second half at 11.9%, very satisfied with how they're tracking. And they're not satisfied, though, to sit on that. They're working very hard to say what's the journey time, the team's objective and even beyond it. So that's our priority #1. 
Priority #2 is capturing the share from the imports. And they've done a phenomenal job of that. And if you look at the imports, while some of that has flowed back, it is at a much higher AUP than was previously, right? So less volume, higher price. That's absolutely the landscape in which we want to compete, which is an even playing field. And so we're competing there and winning. And then from there, I'd say it's new channels and new products. And so new channels, there's a lot of opportunity in e-commerce. We're starting to see that come to fruition and investing behind the opportunity there. And then adjacencies. 
So areas like other rooms. Is there expansion beyond the kitchen where other areas or other vanities. And so that's the order of priority. I'd say that they're attacking these things. And we'll get off of them. And I think as we do, you're going to see both the margin progression that we're absolutely committed to delivering, but also because of what you touched on as well as some of the other areas, I've touched on, there'll be some really nice growth as well."

And if you -- the way we kind of put it together, starting from the very strong performance in this year. Decking, as I said, in excess of 30% in Q4. And again, a real lap there, right, because you had product load-ins ahead of the distribution gains in Q4 of '19. And then we're seeing really, really strong performance in Doors as well. I would say on the Decking side, we've got a capacity plan, and we're kind of working through our capacity plan and then we will try to work an upside plan for that capacity plan to the extent that we're able to bring that upside plan to fruition or see more pricing momentum on Decking, which I think that sector probably merits. There's some upside there. 
And then I think in Doors, there may well be certainly, if the momentum that we're seeing continues, and it's really both wholesale and retail. So it's not just new construction part, but in retail as well. Then we would see it there as well. We were somewhat cautious as we built the plan around just the strength of what we saw towards the end of the year, both in Doors and in our LARSON acquisition. And so we want to kind of progress through the first quarter, and see how that's going. 
But again, the momentum in both of those businesses, like we touched on Plumbing and Cabinets has continued to be very strong and has maintained its velocity coming out the back end of the year. And so I don't disagree with you. I think we put together a prudent plan, and we are still cognizant of the fact that there is pandemic and economic uncertainty out in the world, and we want to manage the P&L very tightly. But we're gearing the business and the capacity to the upside there. And I think you touched on a couple of areas in which it could happen. 
And then just turning to your question on Security. I fully agree with you. We would like to see more growth. Now you had a couple things, a couple dynamics in the year. You had on the retail side of business, you had a back-to-school season that just didn't happen, right? We saw a lot of [indiscernible] and things like that. And you had a commercial channel where we'd go in, really, and do a consultative sale with factories and facilities that shut down in Q2 and stayed shut down throughout the rest of the year. 
We actually exited the fourth quarter with really nice growth in retail in the double digits. And so we were really encouraged by that. And where we got the business squarely focused is on getting the product assortment right, getting the supply chain absolutely set, getting the category management capabilities in and once all that is set, and we made some really good progress and invested for it in 2020, then we're going to start to turn the dial harder on things like innovation, which should then start to raise the top line. 
And so we wanted to be very deliberate about that progression, getting that core right, getting the operations and supply chain absolutely stable and healthy and producing, and then kind of turning that dial on growth. Although even given that, we were happy to see retail, which is the biggest part of the business, power along as it did at the end of the quarter."

Mike, I think just to add to what Nick was saying, I think he hit on the key points. I think there is potential upside to both Doors and decking. I think in decking, the hit on it, it's the pace of our capacity plan and the pricing dynamics in the marketplace, those things could lend upside if they go faster than we are expecting. 
And then Doors, think of the Doors business is probably the 1 business we have that's closer to 50-50 new construction and R&R as opposed to most of our portfolio's about 2/3 or more R&R. And as you recall, our outlook on U.S. new construction is 10% to 12%, I think there's upside to Doors to the extent that builders can pace completions closer to their order flow. 
Our market outlook is really predicated on about 100,000 unit growth in U.S. housing, but that's about 110 to 100 of -- I'm sorry, that's 100 to 110 of new construction -- single-family new construction housing growth and a decline in multifamily for a total of about 75,000 units across the two. So I think it really gets down to kind of the pacing of completions in single-family pickup, and that will help drive that business. 
And then to Nick's point on Security is can we get a real back-to-school season? Can we get the industrial markets opened up as consultants are allowed in factories and get innovation going in that business. Those are the things."

And just wanted to circle back to a prior question around cadence throughout the year and very much appreciate the talk around the top line, where you're saying double-digit top line growth likely to continue into the first quarter, possibly the second. It sounded like by contrast, just again at this point of the year, and obviously, the way the numbers would work, flat to up low single digits, which is still very impressive, obviously, given the tough comps and I think most people would be some -- many people would be thinking perhaps it would be down a little bit. 
So I just want to make sure I heard that right that at this point in the game, as you look at your plans, you're looking for flat to maybe up slightly in the back half? And what that means for EPS distribution? Typically, during the year, you have anywhere from 40% to 45% or so of EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 55%, 60% in the back half. I would almost think this year that would flip. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that."

But I wouldn't overaccentuate it. I mean you do recall, we -- even in the second quarter of 2020 when we had basically a 10-ish percent decline at the top and a 10-ish percent decline on the bottom, we made margin improvement. So there'll be some nice EPS growth across the year, but there will be a little bit more of an unusual bias to the first half."

I'll give you some perspective, and then Pat will speak a little bit to the numbers. But I would say, firstly, just kind of step back from a market perspective, we're very fortunate the 2 most favorable housing markets in the world, the U.S. and China markets, right? And that's where you see the most growth and the most opportunity. And China is sort of the rare market that is not only growing quickly, but also is quite fragmented. 
And so there's still an opportunity to build a lot of share over time. And our business there has been built organically over a long time with a homegrown team that has out-executed that market and now is very focused not on just out executing the top line, but driving profit and driving leverage through the P&L. As much just as good discipline to be able to reinvest in the business for the long run, as a profit driver for us overall, it's really more -- we want that business to be disciplined and to be healthy and be able to to continue to drive itself. And so they've grown incredibly quickly, and the focus has really been on leveraging our brand and channel position into new product adjacencies and new channel adjacencies. 
And I think they do it better than anybody in our business. They really kind of are our North Star for the rest of Fortune Brands in their approach. When you look at the more recent performance, it's continued to power on. We obviously saw the shutdown around Chinese new year and then continue on. As you know, the Chinese economy actually did pretty well, grew a bit over 2% for the year. So pretty impressive. And we're calculating or basing sort of somewhere between 6, maybe a bit more. 
Where we continue to see strength throughout the year was really in the developer side of the business and in the e-commerce side of the business. Showrooms were slower as people were still cautious to head out. But we have a leading share in developer, so we were very excited about that, and developers continue to build. And bear in mind, we're really prioritized on Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. So we're not really exposed to the big speculative buildings and the empty cities that you hear about. We're really big share in Shanghai and other densely populated areas where people are either moving in or upgrading their living circumstances. 
And so we're very bullish on the opportunity in China. Housing continues to be a fundamentally important part of that country's economy, and so we don't see that backing down. And then within housing, we're out executing, and we're out executing with a homegrown team that really knows how to build out the Moen brand and the House of ROHL brands into even broader adjacencies and how to build out new channels and new channel partners. 
And while we've been doing this, actually in 2020, we raised our, let's say, an incremental investment in that business and really started folding the pull behind the brands, not just the push model that we've done really well with over time. And the early read on the brand metrics have been extremely strong. And so we're very excited about China. We think over the long term, it could be a really nice play for our company. We don't necessarily bank on it in any given year, but we've just grown it slowly -- or not so slowly, but I'd say, over a long period of time, to the point where now it's a significant player in that market and can be a significant growth contributor for us."

I think if there's 1 part of our business, and Nick hit on it, that's probably driving innovation at the most rapid pace and with the greatest level of success, including into adjacent categories and finding growth across multiple channels and doing it profitably in that market as well. It's just a -- the talent on the ground we have there is ever bit as strong as the talent we have across the globe, and they're doing an amazing job."

Recall, firstly, we never counted on government assistance to help us. We set about pivoting the portfolio to really aim at the heart of that market like what was working there anyway and adjusted our portfolio to really target that heart of the market. But then we were successful in the anti-dumping suit. And the purpose of that really was to get rid of illegal subsidies and unfair composition. It wasn't to close the board and all imports. And we're happy to import -- we're happy to compete against other low-cost countries, and we feel not only we set up to compete, we're set up to win. 
And I think that's what's now playing out. And so as you've seen, those imports start to migrate to other countries. And by the way, a lot of that is illegal transshipping. And I think customs is going to be all over that. But you're seeing it come across at a higher cost, either because it truly is manufactured in another country. So average selling price out of Vietnam is more than 2x what the China AUP is or it's being illegally transshipped, but frankly, moving stuff from 1 country to another and trying to evade customs has a cost to it, that's being reflected in the marketplace. 
And so I'm sure you're seeing it through your channel checks. But you go to the channel checks. You'll hear that imports are still struggling from a supply chain perspective, lead times are long and pricing is up. And that is a very favorable backdrop for which for us to compete. And that's why it's 1 of the reasons why we're not seeing growth across the board, even though you could argue on a dollar perspective, those imports are kind of probably at a dollar level where they were prior to the run-up of inventory with the duties coming on. 
The playing field is level and the business is competing well. And that's the only outcome we could have hoped for. And again, not trying to shut a Board, we're just trying to have a level playing field. And it's had the necessary impact. We will, however, continue to aggressively investigate or help pursue anybody who cheats and there's going to be cheating happening, but it happens with enough incremental cost, but I think it's leveled out the playing field enough. Pat, you want to touch on the margin."
33174798,700851977,2240773,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","I think, Justin, you saw this year, 70 basis points of margin improvement on the full year, but the Cabinet business was probably the most severely impacted along with our Security business on the second quarter shutdown.

And so if you really look at the back half margin of that business, which is 11.9%, I think it's more indicative of kind of where they're running at these days. And you hit out 1 of the levers to kind of get this farther up the margin chain and more towards that mid teens. 
I think there's room to go on both the stock and the make-to-order side of the businesses. We'll deal with inflation in our Cabinet business as we do in all of our businesses. We'll take continuous cost improvement and supply chain actions that were necessary price to drive improvement offsets inflation. And then I think getting leveraged to get further margin expansion, there's still a lot of growth on the asset and SG&A base and stock and also, I would say, during '20, we were repurposing some older capacity on the fly and still are in the early parts of this year, that is not the optimal way to service demand. We're doing that just because the demand is so strong. So there's still some footprint optimization to go in the stock business. 
And then I think we did a lot of hard work to standardize product and rightsize the semi-custom and premium make-to-order businesses. A, there's still some more standardization opportunity out there. And all the hard work to rightsize those businesses, and now that those businesses are growing, you're going to see in '21 and beyond, the ability to leverage the tough restructuring work that the teams have been doing for the 2 years in that business. So I think you're going to see both stock and make-to-order contributing to growth from this point forward. 
I think what you haven't seen and really until the back half of this year is on the stock side. You still had so many things moving to service demand. You weren't seeing the optimal long-term cost structure for the stock side, and you were still seeing decline in make-to-order. And it's only now that we're seeing the stock gets closer to its end game, and we're seeing growth in make-to-order to leverage that resized business. 
So I think there's good opportunity ahead for both of them. And we're wide eyed to the competition. As Nick said, we built a better mousetrap. We're not looking for the government to give that business margin and that business is demonstrating that it can compete for share and turn it into margin accretion."

I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe as parts of the world begins to reopen.
I couldn't be more proud of our first quarter results, which reflect a broad-based acceleration of our remarkable 2020 performance. Our business performed very strongly across the board. For the quarter, our total company sales increased by 26% over last year, with each business delivering double-digit organic growth. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 14.8%, and earnings per share increased 68%. This performance is the result of exceptional execution by our teams in the housing market, which we believe is in the early stages of a period of long-term sustainable growth.
Our stellar first quarter results were meaningfully ahead of a strong market and lapped a very good Q1 in 2020. Importantly, we continue to drive market-leading growth while advancing our strategic agenda, including accelerating our margin improvement initiatives. Our focus on execution, efficiency and safety drove share gains and favorable operational leverage. This focus allowed us to continue to service our customers and consumers with our industry-leading brands and innovation while also increasing investment in the business.
These best-in-class results cannot be achieved about our wonderful people. They drive what we call the Fortune Brands advantage, which I introduced to you 1 year ago. This powerful combination of our common center capabilities, including category management, global supply chain excellence and complexity reduction skills deployed across 40 brands will continue to provide both investment for sustained above-market growth and operating margin improvement into the future. 
Our performance continues to demonstrate that Fortune brings is among the most reliable providers to our channel partners delivering high levels of service in a high-demand environment, while proactively working to keep people safe. As the pandemic moves into its next stages, we've continued our efforts to keep our employees safe by working tirelessly to secure access to vaccines for our workers.
Through the efforts of our local teams, we have held or are planning on holding nearly 20 on-site vaccination events across our locations. We are also working with local communities to help with their local vaccination events and are engaging and educating our employees to ensure the highest vaccine adoption rates possible.
I'm proud of our safety track record during the pandemic, which continues to be ahead of manufacturing and national benchmarks. That said, we've learned a lot about operating in this type of environment, and we'll apply those lessons to continuously improve and make Fortune Brands as stand out among employers.
On the back of our continued outperformance, in the housing market with long-term sustainable growth momentum, we have increased the global and U.S. market expectations for our leading brands and our financial guidance for the year. Pat will go into greater detail later how we are successfully navigating demand-driven challenges to be able to pursue higher rates of growth, margin, earnings and cash flow for our stakeholders. We will leverage our Fortune Brands advantage in this favorable market to accelerate operating income improvement and continue to free up incremental cash to make strategic long-term investments in our brands, innovation, digital strategy and supply chain capacity. This will enable us to capture more opportunities and continue to increase our share gains over time.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our first quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as our thoughts around increased guidance to our financial outlook for the year.
Now turning to our views on the housing market. Long-term fundamentals for housing and home products remain very favorable, and the rate of demand has further accelerated after a strong second half of 2020. As has been widely noted, the U.S. is currently millions of homes under booked as growth in housing supply has not kept up with household formations. This dynamic has grown over a long period, and we expect the unwinding to persist for a long time.
This supply imbalance has reached a point where even at the current rate of new construction starts, it will take several years for supply and demand to come into balance. This severely underbooked environment impacts both new construction and recurring remodel activity as consumers are faced with the choice of purchasing a new home or updating very aged housing stock. As a result, we are uniquely positioned with our leading brands and channel positions to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity. A differentiated exposure to new construction, combined with our powerful channel strength in R&R will remain a level for growth well into the future.
Additionally, demographic driven forces support the need for this expansionary housing environment to persist. The key millennial generation continues to move into their home buying years. While the baby boomer generation is choosing to age in place and is adapting their homes accordingly. The pandemic has accelerated favorable trends that were already in place and has increased focus on the value proposition of the home. Even as vaccine distribution expands and the majority of the U.S. population is vaccinated this year, both employers and employees have seen the benefits of more flexible workplace arrangements.
This resulting shift away from a full work week in the office will create continued demand for workspace in the home and allow employees the optionality of living further from their offices. Moreover, we've also seen purchases of second homes rise. Our brands and products are well positioned to capitalize on this likely to be lasting movement.
Turning specifically to new construction. Activity remains robust, driven by these very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates. Current pace and activity seem only to be governed by the ability of builders to source land, labor and materials effectively. Although inventory and rising home prices might create uneven growth trajectory, we strongly believe that favorable demographics will fuel a multiyear sustainable housing expansion. As I mentioned, repair and remodel activity also remains very strong and has expanded into 2021 as consumers spend on home improvement projects to refurbish an aging housing stock.
With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventories being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. For example, we saw strong double-digit growth in the premium price point segments of our cabinets and plumbing businesses, indicating the strength of large ticket R&R. Current homeowners, while also driving investment, is rising home prices have increased home equity levels to an all-time record of more than $7 trillion. This significant driver of R&R activity is amplified by the fact that consumers today are sitting on $2 trillion more in saving accounts than before the start of the pandemic.
This combination of favorable demographics, severe underbuilding, attractive interest rates, high home equity levels and the focus on the home as a place for multifunctional enjoyment gives us confidence in our increased market forecast for 2021 and the anticipated persistent housing tailwind we expect for years to come.
Much attention in the first quarter of this year has been paid to material and other cost inflation as well as pressure in global supply chains. We are pulling every lever available to us to service our customers. As we have demonstrated, our ability to mitigate and overcome challenges, whether demand, supply or inflationary in nature has been prudent through our consistent delivery of results. As we speak to you today, having once again delivered exceptional performance and having increased our financial outlook for the year for both sales and margin, we will continue to be laser-focused on driving consistent stakeholder value across the organization in all matter of the environment.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. We further executed on our margin accretion objectives in the quarter as we saw the continued benefit from our efficiency programs, which began in early 2020. Consistent with our strategy, the execution of our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities created fuel for growth that allowed us to invest in key growth initiatives, including in our brand and product innovation, digital capabilities and capacity expansions.
Importantly, these cross-company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule and have contributed to our growth and margin improvement in the quarter. With an even stronger 2021 outlook, we are accelerating investment behind our core strategies while also delivering margin improvement above our prior expectations. At the same time, we will maintain investment discipline, knowing that the pandemic is still ongoing and expansions do not always unfold in a linear way, so as to deliver consistent performance for our stakeholders.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we are positioning for a stronger long-term future. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets. The business accelerated through the first quarter of this year with sales have in excess of 30% in the quarter. These strong sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 24% OI margin, notwithstanding increased investment in brands, innovation and customer service. We experienced very strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Even if we exclude China to isolate the first quarter of 2020's plumbing impact on the business, plumbing sales still grew in excess of 25%. 
Our loan brand continues to win in its core products and adjacencies. Our leading brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty metrics show non persistently resonates with the key millennial consumer. Our cutting-edge marketing is winning accolades, and we are investing more behind our powerful campaign. Our combination of advanced smart technology and on-trend designs drive share and profit growth as no one leads in defining the way humans will interact with water now and into the future.
We made significant progress as our flow line on technology rolled out into a key builder partner, and we also increased our retail distribution. We also further expanded Moen's smart home network with our flow by long digital sump monitor, which 1 accolades at CES and the prestigious KBIS show. Our sustained investment in innovation, brand and channel with unrelenting focus on product delivery and service levels, will continue to perpetuate the cycle of outperformance for North America's leading plumbing brand. 
Additionally, Moen China continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, while providing high levels of product quality and service to our customers. All of our channels grew double-digit versus their first quarter 2019 pre-COVID levels. We have rolled out increased brand investment in China and are seeing a very strong response to our campaign.
Finally, the House of ROHL were in excess of 25% globally despite continued restrictions and showroom capacity in the U.S. and rolling lockdowns in Canada and Europe. The positioning of these brands is authentic luxury plumbing collections resonates with consumers who are leveraging their own strong balance sheets to elevate and customize their kitchen and bathroom designs.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by over 45% and operating margin increased by over 300 basis points to 13.5%. Organic sales, which exclude our recent LARSON acquisition came in at an impressive 15% growth. These exceptional results were driven by very strong double-digit decking and doors growth, continued growth in security and exceptional execution across the segment.
With respect to LARSON, our teams are hard at work in integrating the business and capturing expected growth and synergies. The LARSON team is proving to be a wonderful fit with our Fortune Brands family. There is no work to do, but we are ahead of schedule, and our expectation of synergies from this addition to our portfolio are as good or better than we thought at the time we announced the transaction. 
Turning to decking. Fiberon grew in excess of 40%, an impressive feat during the winter period that normally includes some seasonal selling. Momentum in our decking brand has not only continued but is strengthening. Similar to other composite board makers, we continue to take increasing share from lumber decking products. Our investment thesis continues to be confirmed as distribution expansion, coupled with leveraging our percent brands advantage capabilities, positions Fiberon for long-term growth in the market, fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials. We remain on track to add capacity midyear as we drive double-digit top line growth across Viber.
With inflationary pressure on lumber over much over the last year, the price differential between commodity wood and branded engineered decking is negligible, contributing to a greater number of customers choosing Engineered Materials. That said, even as lumber pricing moderates, the cost benefit equation will continue to weigh heavily in favor of Engineered Materials and the value proposition will continue to improve through branding and innovation.
Sales in our legacy doors brand experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity as new construction ramped up during the quarter, leveraging our deeply developed channel. Our advantaged single-family new construction exposure is driving results at Therma-Tru and our team is working hard to supply increasing demand while navigating cost and supply chain challenges. Much like Fiberon, consumers are increasingly realizing the benefits of engineered products or the more traditional materials used in exterior doors and outdoor living. These conversion tailwinds will continue to power our Doors business well ahead of the market. Our new design tools, innovation and performance and functionality and the ability to customize through technologically-driven skins and coatings have expanded the opportunity set in this product category, where we have deepened our position as the #1 exterior door brand.
Turning to Security. Sales grew further this past quarter as commercial and international markets continue to open. Master Lock is continuing to demonstrate improved performance as it progresses its transformation under its new leadership. We are employing Fortune Brands advantage capabilities within our security operations to drive growth and operating margin improvement. In fact, securities performance this past quarter contributed to the success of overall margin progression in the segment versus a year ago. 
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales grew low double digits for the third quarter in a row as single-family new construction and bigger ticket R&R increased. With strong growth across product lines at all price points, operating margins expanded by 180 basis points over prior year to 10.8%. Having impressive margin improvement was off of a strong Q1 last year as new construction activity produced seasonally strong results a year ago.
Our Cabinets business continues to demonstrate how our hard work over the past few years produces market-leading top line performance at increasing margins. We've considerably changed the way we look at both our current operations and view our future opportunities. Our work in our global low-cost supply chain is adding flexibility and resiliency to the business. We're building a scalable and cost-effective network across our platform with increased simplification and commonization driving both operating leverage and best-in-class service. We're winning share against a fragmented domestic market and against imports, which are coming in at higher cost and at longer lead times.
We're seeing growth at both ends of the press spectrum. Our cabinets per the plant now in the late innings positions our business extremely well to capitalize wherever demand materializes. In the first quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in both our make-to-order and value price categories. In our make-to-order business, we are seeing strong trends this past quarter in the U.S., led by premium price points and a nice return to performance in Canada as that housing market reaccelerates.
Our best-in-class dealer network continues to deliver for us. Additionally, our Cabinet team is exploring new omnichannel opportunities and is accelerating investments in e-commerce.
Within our value price grid cabinets, we continue to gain share while optimizing our operations and offerings. During the quarter, demand was widespread in value cabinets across builder, dealer and retail channels. We made considerable progress in capacity and distribution with investments in the quarter in Mexico as well as the on-time opening of our new Southeast facility see surging demand in Mantra and other value-priced products. We expect another breakout year for our Mantra line in 2021, which serves the market previously addressed by importers with stylish short lead time product. 
Our Cabinet team has increased share by continuing to win in the market and is doing so on an advantaged replatformed cost base. More opportunity lies ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same figure and tenacity that they have demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid-teens margins.
In summary, our teams work tirelessly to deliver on our purpose fulfilling the dreams of home. And we take great pride in our impact on the quality of people's lives within the home. The world is not without challenges or risks, health, safety or otherwise. The home provides comfort, protection, respite and is a center for him a connection, whether it be work, school, entertaining or generally forming deeper relationships between friends and family. We are central to the role of the home and our private met role comes through in our brands, innovation and people every day. 
In addition to filling the dreams of home, our company is committed to doing its part to help improve the lives of those around us, to our environmental, social and governance efforts. Whether it's through our environmentally responsible products, leading safety record or diversity equity and inclusion initiatives, we are continually challenging ourselves to raise the bar. I encourage you to visit our website to see our recently released ESG report. Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and low supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for houses. As the market expands to fold the severe gap in housing supply, we expect to scale ahead of that demand and continue to take share, consistent with our long track record. Our innovative portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market and this broader channel exposure than ever before.
By leveraging our own actions to continuously improve the business and our premium resilience We intend to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion while managing any volatility that may come our way. With our exceptional team, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are uniquely positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders.
Our updated and improved 2021 outlook reflects the strength of our business with robust growth translating to operating leverage and increased margins while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond, while fully offsetting inflation and supply chain challenges to produce even stronger results. In addition, our powerful balance sheet positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for what our world-class brands and people can accomplish.
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"

As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.

As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our first quarter results.
Sales were $1.77 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Organic sales growth, excluding the LARSON acquisition, was up 19%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $262 million, up 54% or $92 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 270 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.36 for the quarter, up 68% versus $0.81 the same quarter last year. Our associates focus on safety and outperforming a strong market drove these outstanding results.
The momentum of activity in our markets was strong throughout the quarter and remained strong. While we are working hard to service the robust demand across the portfolio, we are also taking action against material and freight inflation and supply chain imbalances. We expect to offset these challenges fully to deliver higher growth and greater profitability than we planned.
Our high-performing business model of leading brands and channel positions combined with further deployment of our Fortune Brands Advantage, drives both incremental investments and increased value to the bottom line for our stakeholders.
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the first quarter were $622 million, up $153 million or 33% or up 30% adjusting for FX. First quarter growth was up very strong double digits across all major brands, channels and geographies. Plumbing operating income increased 43% to $149 million for the first quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 24%, reflecting strong volume leverage despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to maintain service levels. We expect 2021 margins to be at or above 22% for the full year.
Turning to Outdoors & Securities. Sales for the first quarter were $462 million, up $148 million or 47%, driven by the addition of LARSON as well as strong double-digit growth in doors and decking and continued growth in security. On an organic basis, sales were up 15%. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth. Door sales were up double digits in the first quarter, driven by consistently strong retail sales and an accelerating new construction market. Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. Demand in retail and wholesale channels remain strong. We are selling every board we can make. We are on pace to bring additional capacity online in the middle of this year and are looking for options to pull forward capacity plans from 2022 and beyond.
Security sales continued single-digit growth in the quarter with strength in retail and international markets. Commercial markets showed improvement throughout the quarter and are poised to continue to perform better throughout the remainder of the year. Outdoors & Securities segment operating income was $62 million during the quarter, up 91% over the same quarter last year driven by the addition of LARSON and performance improvement in doors, decking and security. Segment operating margin increased 310 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 13.5%.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the first quarter were $688 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2020. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to double-digit growth in the quarter. This positive signal for big-ticket R&R reflects consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes.
Operating income in the first quarter was $75 million, up 34% or $19 million versus the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, up 180 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We expect Cabinets to deliver an average second half operating margin of 13% or greater as we benefit from our efforts to streamline operations and invest to capture additional share gain.
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on material and cost inflation in the face of elevated demand and amid a backdrop of an accelerating housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our businesses. We do this through continuous cost improvement throughout our operations. We enacted major programs during the past year and are furthering those initiatives in 2021. We also employ cost sharing with suppliers where appropriate. Finally, when necessary, we act via price. Through this combination of actions, we plan to offset fully all inflationary headwinds this year and expect to deliver 2021 margin improvement and remain on an increasing margin trajectory over the next several years.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash of $356 million, net debt of $2.3 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now 2.1x. We ended the first quarter with approximately $755 million of total available liquidity. We have made and will continue to make significant investments. We are continuously assessing opportunities to deploy capital strategically to accelerate growth and stakeholder value creation. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks and our dividend, building on the over $1 billion of capital deployed during 2020.
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Given our continued outperformance and strengthening home products market, we are raising our market and financial outlook for the full year of 2021. Based on the expectation that the global market for our products will grow 9% to 11%, with the U.S. housing market growing 10% to 12%. And within this market forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 14% and U.S. R&R growth of 10% to 12%.
Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth is expected to be 20% to 22% or 13% to 15% on an organic basis. Our full year operating margin is expected to be around or above 15%. We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.45 to $5.65 on a before charge gain basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth in excess of 30% over a record year in 2020. Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our updated guidance includes: Plumbing net sales growth of 15% to 17%, with operating margins at or above 22%; Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 43% to 47% or 11% to 13%, excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 15% to 16% or approximately 16% to 17% adjusted for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses; Cabinet net sales growth of 11% to 13% with operating margins at or above 12%. 
We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $650 million to $700 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%. The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $104 million to $106 million, interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million, a tax rate of between 23% and 24% and average fully diluted shares of approximately $140 million to $141 million.
We expect a long runway of fundamental housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. We expect our sales to continue outperforming the market, which will accelerate our margin progression. Our strong balance sheet allows for us to continue to assess further opportunities to deploy capital strategically. We see multiple paths of future value creation to pursue for our stakeholders. Our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. Our teams remain committed to driving market-beating sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.
Our revised 2021 guidance is solidly on the trajectory of the 3-year outlook reflected in our updated investor presentation. This outlook contains a compound annual sales growth rate of 8% to 11%, and a 2023 operating margin target of 16% to 17% relative to a global market growth CAGR expectation of 6% to 8%.

So we definitely expect growth in the back half, and we expect to outperform that growth. I put the market into context by half of the year. You heard our updated market guidance, which is, call it, roughly 10% for the full year. I'd characterize the first half is kind of mid-teens or better. And the back half is kind of mid-single digits or better from a market growth perspective. And then when you think about what that means for our sales across the halves of the year, we're thinking about reported sales growth in the first half averaging around 30%, and reported sales growth in the back half averaging around 10%. So both first half and back half strength versus the market. And then even on an organic basis, a first half organic growth around 20% and a back half organic growth around high single-digit versus a mid-single-digit market. So we are expecting back half growth. We just see the strength in the housing market continue. We expect to continue to outperform it. I probably further clarify, LARSON is probably $450-ish million in there with about $250 million of that coming in the first half, just to kind of give you the way we see the year unfolding right now.
And I do think at least it seems like it's tracking this way for the first half, but it seems also likely to track this way for the back half of the year where on a quarter-by-quarter basis, looking at it in stacked margin versus those averages are helpful ways to look at these."

Really nice to see it come through in make-to-order cabinets side and really being -- as we said in the prepared remarks, really led by premium, which I think tells us something about how the consumer is thinking about investing in their house. The confidence that they have in home values and liquidity. And so that's rolling through very nicely. Now as we've talked about previously, I mean, we did a lot of work around the supply chain. We talked a lot about the work that we did on the value side to create a highly competitive global supply chain.
We've also done a lot of work on the made-to-order side to kind of take out unnecessary complexity, to simplify wherever we can, commonize where we can, and that is helping compound a lot of the margin accretion in the business. The work is far from done. Dave and his team continue to identify more and more opportunities to go after that. But it's well underway and it's well understood. And so as you start to see volume flow through that made-to-order, we'll see benefit there, certainly, as you point out on a dollar perspective and then also have plans to drive the margins further. So Pat, do you want to add anything to add?"

When people are are buying more premium-priced cabinetry, it just shows the confidence they have in their home, in their home values and their willingness to invest in their homes. So I think it's a great overall kind of market strength signal. I think when you talk about percentages, the Cabinets team is trying to drive both the make-to-order and the stock business to the mid-teens margin of the whole Cabinet portfolio. As you point out, though, in the make-to-order side you sell in the boxes at 2x to 3x, sometimes even more than 3x the cost of the stock boxes. So the dollar profit is quite substantially higher, which allows you to leverage SG&A much more significantly. So to the extent the level of strength we're seeing continues, that will be a powerful SG&A leverage and kind of upside to the next couple of years."

How much additional breathing room to the investments that you expect to come online midyear give you this year, given that it sounds like you're already sort of eyeing additional investments.

And",410,"Yes, why don't I -- I'll start off and give you kind of a couple of different perspectives around it and Pat can help lay out sort of how that comes online. But the first thing I absolutely are pushing hard and getting everything we can out the door. And you're not wrong on pricing, I think -- although if you find as we build out the fiber on brand, we are really trying to work on leading in pricing. I think that's important. This is a high value proposition for consumers. And it is one that is driven both by brand and by innovation. And so it's taking from commoditized unbranded wood with a much higher value proposition and that deserves a premium. And so I think there's that equation and keeping that equation right. So the value always sits in favor of the consumer, but I think there is a pricing opportunity. And I think you'll see us start to develop a really good track record at driving that. 
And then as you think about the capacity, yes, we do have more coming online, and we're looking to pull more into 2021 from 2022 and into '22 from '23. The way we've been able to approach it has been fairly incremental, A, investing to get more capacity and more efficiency out of the assets we have. I think under Fortune Brands ownership, we're getting a far greater efficiency level out of those assets and have plans to continue to increase that. And then as we add capacity for us, it's sort of a extruder at a time. And so it's a very manageable approach to adding that capacity. These are not giant big bites that we have to take. That said, there may come a time where we do want to add an incrementally larger footprint. But that's also something we know how to do. I mean, we opened facilities all the time. And so I think we feel we can do that fairly efficiently.
And so we feel good about what we're adding this year. That said, I'm pretty bullish. It sounds like year or 2 in the category, so I don't expect that we'll find ourselves overcapacitized anytime this year or next year. Our plans are to meet the market. But as we continue to gain share, we continue to sell out at the capacity we have. Pat, any color you to add on timing standpoint?"

I think to Nick's point, most of our stuff is adding modest increments of assets at a time. They're digestible. And you can obviously slow things down as well if that were to be needed.

But we saw -- as we looked across the portfolio and really did this as a team, late '19 or early '20, we've said what could we do from a business model perspective across Fortune Brands to really elevate the whole? And as we did that, we identified pockets of things that we were actually, A, doing really well and, B, investing behind. I mean, we're not just doing it very good at it, but we were doing it well because we're putting the dollars and the people behind building capabilities. But we were doing it in pockets and yet these were things that were easily leverageable across the whole business. And so we really organized as a whole executive team against the Fortune Brands advantage to leverage these capabilities. And so things like category management. I mean, if you look at our categories, right, we're with very few exceptions, we're the leader. And in those other exceptions, we're a top 3 in all of our categories. And so as such, we should be able to bring category insights. I understand how shelf just said, how we engage consumers, what works best for them, where the innovation lies, price elasticities. And so how do we become really a category management leader and build that up.
The other is global sourcing. I mean, we're a manufacturer or a global sourcer. We have a very complex global supply chain. There are sourcing skills and capabilities that can really not just improve the cost basis, and they can do that in a very big way. But also the quality and resiliency of the sourcing base in a business. And so we've invested quite heavily and centrally to build out teams to go off those opportunities. And when I say investment, this could be single-digit million, but really that's driving double-digit millions over time.
And then the third one today is really around business simplification and leveraging tools likely and like 80/20, but doing it in a more consistent way across the business, consistent training, speaking the same language, understanding the value chain and where we're going to get value. And so the vision is as we really drive these, over time, these will just be the language we speak because will be the skills we have, the capabilities, we'll embed them into the business and then be able to kind of germinate new capabilities under the Fortune Brands Advantage umbrella that are going to help drive growth, right? And we're looking really hard right now at investments for making in digital. We have unique insights across the very broad portfolio that we have about what's happening in the housing market that we can drill down to. We built the data like across all of our products. You can see POS in everything that we do and start to fare that trend very quickly. So we're very excited about this. And I think we wanted to start. Concretely, get some wins on the board and then really build momentum behind this business model over time."

Truman, inflation has been intense across materials and freight. For us specifically, things like metal, hardwood and freight to proven the most extensive, but certainly, petroleum-based resins have been challenges as well as much from the Texas storm as from the in place in perspective. So an intent amount last year, 2020, our full year COGS base was about $3.9 billion. And I'll tell you that inflation this year is going to be in the kind of 4.5% to 5% of COGS range. And much of that is yet to come. I mean, we probably have less than 20% of that flow through our Q1 P&L. Much of it, therefore, you're talking more than 80% is going to flow through the balance of the year. And we are -- we're going to offset it with a combination of cost actions and where necessary price over the balance of the year. I think you should expect that across all 4 quarters. We'll show a measure of margin improvement. It will be tightest during Q2, in part just because freight really surged again kind of at the very end of last year and in Q1.

I mean, if you go back to plywood tariffs in 2017, where we had to change out $100 million with the buy out of China into other geographies and do it very quickly.

So if you recall, last year, we were down about 9% top line in the second quarter. And as I said, we're going to be averaging about 30% across the first half in terms of reported sales growth. So backing that up, that means down 9% last year second quarter, then up about high 30s to approaching 40 this year, getting to that stack 30% for the second quarter. And then similarly, on the organic basis, kind of averaging about 20% across the first half of the year.
The one thing I would point out is last year, while we were down 9% in the second quarter, we had really good expense and cash management in that down quarter, and our operating margin last year, with sales down was 14.3%. So we managed our bottom line very effectively during the second quarter. We'll still make a margin progression this quarter because all of our teams are working very hard on driving the business forward and contributing to the full year margin expansion of around 100 basis points, but it will be 50 basis points or less during that second quarter, I'd say, in terms of margin expansion."

I'll take it and maybe Nick could give some color. I start with what is the mix signal about the market and I think as -- especially as you've seen housing activity in suburbs, in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Upper Midwest, where you have people moving from cities out into suburbs at housing price points that are relatively high and having a lot of confidence in the ability of both housing value to sustain and their desire to invest in their home because they're going to probably be spending a bit more time there than they expected to be. It gives a lot of great signal at the housing market in terms of people investing in larger single-family homes than doing it in a premium fashion is well underway. And it's nice relative to the last housing expansion, this is really not happening with unsustainable home equity loans or something like that. This is people, for the most part, using cash to do it. So I think it's a great signal for the market.
I think in terms of mix and how to think about it from our business, we've been working as we've been preparing for the millennial generation to make entry price point and mid-price point products on a percentage basis, every bit as attractive as premium-priced products. So we've been trying to make across our portfolio, our ability to increase margins a possibility even if it was a lot of millennials buying, opening price point product. So we try to not overplay mix. But as we talked about with some of the questions I think we got to with Phil, on an absolute dollar basis, if you're selling a $1,000 faucet instead of a $200 faucet, even that's a same percentage margin, obviously, it's a lot more dollars. And so I think the upside that you're pointing to is it really allows you to leverage your fixed cost base. And so if we were to see a pronounced and sustained mix in premium there'll probably be upside to some of the figures we've given out there because it'd be reasonable to assume it's kind of new news, and therefore, it's kind of not in our multiyear assumption, some massive mix shift. And if that does perpetuate and sustain at the levels it's had recently, it would be upside. Just leveraging fixed cost base off of higher absolute dollar contribution per unit."

And where you look at where it's coming from and as Pat referenced, some of those markets are a lot healthier home equity levels are high. There's a degree of confidence. Also some of our builder partners have pointed out, where there's sort of first few years of the millennial buyer was really focused on that entry-level price point. You're now having some first-time homebuyers for millennials, but are fairly deep into their careers and are buying homes that were previously considered kind of second upgrade type homes and sort of coming in and really building out those houses with sort of every option available. And so that, I think, combined with some of the value that you're seeing, the Boomer, Generation Gen X kind of put back into homes as their confidence has increased and the home is really, really generally a very aged. Housing stock gives us more and more confidence around the premium of that portfolio. So it's very exciting but margins are fairly comparable. But certainly, dollars are higher and a lot of design cues come out of having that portfolio that we leverage across everything."

I'll give you some color on the, firstly, we don't comment on particular timing of price increases kind of on a product-by-product basis, but I would refer you in my comments earlier that you have seen Fiberon start to really take a leadership position on pricing in the category. And this is a product that we -- when we purchased it, it really had built out its business at the entry level of deck board, and our opportunity was really to move up the price spectrum. And as we built out the wholesale distribution that supports that not just in wholesale, but also in retail, which fills special order through our wholesale partners. And so there's both a pricing opportunity in decking as well as a really good mix opportunity in decking. And just to come in the earlier conversation that we're having. This is an area where you see better margin as you move up the price spectrum. And so we think that is a nice opportunity. And so I think on both, you may see some tailwinds.
With respect to the imports, if you look -- a couple of things I'd point out. One is broadly stabilized from a volume perspective. And so from a volume perspective, kind of comparable to where it was pre -- there was a big run up in imports of to the antidumping cases filed as importers try to bring a ton of inventory in, where it's stabilized now is well below that. It's sort of the volume -- the sort of dollar levels where it was running previously. A couple of things that are different, though. While dollar levels are the same, our read on pricing in the market is that it's significantly higher than it was kind of back in '18. And so we believe that volume is a lot less than it was. 
And secondly, we make up a greater share of those imports to our global supply chain than we did then. And so on a volume perspective, while dollars have stabilized and have been coupled to that period volume, we think is quite a fair amount down. But the really important thing about it and why it isn't impacting us is while -- to a degree, it's been replaced, it's been replaced by importers who have product with longer lead times, less few availability and more cost. And whether it's more cost because they're legitimately competing or whether it's more cost because their trans shipping, it doesn't really matter. It's adding enough cost to the system. And we always said that we were going to build a global supply chain, it didn't rely on government intervention, it was going to be cost competitive no matter what. And so it's proving to be very cost against imports, and we find that dealers are continuing to come to us looking for replace the product at an accelerating rate.
The other thing I'd call out is customs is really ramping enforcement against the tranche shippers. And I think that's going to even have a further damping effect on imports as we go forward. So the combination of that antidumping case, but more importantly, the work that we did when we platform our whole global supply chain has had the intended effect, and you've seen that come through in both the top line and margin numbers now."

I hope that you and your loved ones are all staying safe as parts of the world begins to reopen.
I couldn't be more proud of our first quarter results, which reflect a broad-based acceleration of our remarkable 2020 performance. Our business performed very strongly across the board. For the quarter, our total company sales increased by 26% over last year, with each business delivering double-digit organic growth. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 14.8%, and earnings per share increased 68%. This performance is the result of exceptional execution by our teams in the housing market, which we believe is in the early stages of a period of long-term sustainable growth.
Our stellar first quarter results were meaningfully ahead of a strong market and lapped a very good Q1 in 2020. Importantly, we continue to drive market-leading growth while advancing our strategic agenda, including accelerating our margin improvement initiatives. Our focus on execution, efficiency and safety drove share gains and favorable operational leverage. This focus allowed us to continue to service our customers and consumers with our industry-leading brands and innovation while also increasing investment in the business.
These best-in-class results cannot be achieved about our wonderful people. They drive what we call the Fortune Brands advantage, which I introduced to you 1 year ago. This powerful combination of our common center capabilities, including category management, global supply chain excellence and complexity reduction skills deployed across 40 brands will continue to provide both investment for sustained above-market growth and operating margin improvement into the future. 
Our performance continues to demonstrate that Fortune brings is among the most reliable providers to our channel partners delivering high levels of service in a high-demand environment while proactively working to keep people safe. As the pandemic moves into its next stages, we've continued our efforts to keep our employees safe by working tirelessly to secure access to vaccines for our workers.
Through the efforts of our local teams, we have held or are planning on holding nearly 20 on-site vaccination events across our locations. We are also working with local communities to help with their local vaccination events and are engaging and educating our employees to ensure the highest vaccine adoption rates possible.
I'm proud of our safety track record during the pandemic, which continues to be ahead of manufacturing and national benchmarks. That said, we've learned a lot about operating in this type of environment, and we'll apply those lessons to continuously improve and make Fortune Brands as stand out among employers.
On the back of our continued outperformance, in the housing market with long-term sustainable growth momentum, we have increased the global and U.S. market expectations for our leading brands and our financial guidance for the year. Pat will go into greater detail later how we are successfully navigating demand-driven challenges to be able to pursue higher rates of growth, margin, earnings and cash flow for our stakeholders. 
We will leverage our Fortune Brands advantage in this favorable market to accelerate operating income improvement and continue to free up incremental cash to make strategic long-term investments in our brands, innovation, digital strategy and supply chain capacity. This will enable us to capture more opportunities and continue to increase our share gains over time.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our first quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as our thoughts around increased guidance to our financial outlook for the year.
Now turning to our views on the housing market. Long-term fundamentals for housing and home products remain very favorable, and the rate of demand has further accelerated after a strong second half of 2020. As has been widely noted, the U.S. is currently millions of homes under booked as growth in housing supply has not kept up with household formations. This dynamic has grown over a long period, and we expect the unwinding to persist for a long time.
This supply imbalance has reached a point where even at the current rate of new construction starts, it will take several years for supply and demand to come into balance. This severely underbooked environment impacts both new construction and recurring remodel activity as consumers are faced with the choice of purchasing a new home or updating very aged housing stock. As a result, we are uniquely positioned with our leading brands and channel positions to take advantage of the tailwind of long-term housing activity. A differentiated exposure to new construction, combined with our powerful channel strength in R&R will remain a level for growth well into the future.
Additionally, demographic-driven forces support the need for this expansionary housing environment to persist. The key millennial generation continues to move into their home-buying years. While the Baby Boomer generation is choosing to age in place and is adapting their homes accordingly. The pandemic has accelerated favorable trends that were already in place and has increased focus on the value proposition of the home. Even as vaccine distribution expands and the majority of the U.S. population is vaccinated this year, both employers and employees have seen the benefits of more flexible workplace arrangements.
This resulting shift away from a full work week in the office will create continued demand for workspace in the home and allow employees the optionality of living further from their offices. Moreover, we've also seen purchases of second homes rise. Our brands and products are well positioned to capitalize on this likely to be lasting movement.
Turning specifically to new construction. Activity remains robust, driven by these very favorable demographics, low inventory and attractive mortgage rates. Current pace and activity seem only to be governed by the ability of builders to source land, labor and materials effectively. Although inventory and rising home prices might create uneven growth trajectory, we strongly believe that favorable demographics will fuel a multiyear sustainable housing expansion. As I mentioned, repair and remodel activity also remains very strong and has expanded into 2021 as consumers spend on home improvement projects to refurbish an aging housing stock.
With demand for homes outpacing supply, older inventories being purchased, leading to significant R&R projects as homes are modernized. For example, we saw strong double-digit growth in the premium price point segments of our cabinets and plumbing businesses, indicating the strength of large ticket R&R. Current homeowners, while also driving investment, is rising home prices have increased home equity levels to an all-time record of more than $7 trillion. This significant driver of R&R activity is amplified by the fact that consumers today are sitting on $2 trillion more in saving accounts than before the start of the pandemic.
This combination of favorable demographics, severe underbuilding, attractive interest rates, high home equity levels and the focus on the home as a place for multifunctional enjoyment gives us confidence in our increased market forecast for 2021 and the anticipated persistent housing tailwind we expect for years to come.
Much attention in the first quarter of this year has been paid to material and other cost inflation as well as pressure in global supply chains. We are pulling every lever available to us to service our customers. As we have demonstrated, our ability to mitigate and overcome challenges, whether demand, supply or inflationary in nature has been prudent through our consistent delivery of results. As we speak to you today, having once again delivered exceptional performance and having increased our financial outlook for the year for both sales and margin, we will continue to be laser-focused on driving consistent stakeholder value across the organization in all matter of the environment.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. We further executed on our margin accretion objectives in the quarter as we saw the continued benefit from our efficiency programs, which began in early 2020. Consistent with our strategy, the execution of our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities created fuel for growth that allowed us to invest in key growth initiatives, including in our brand and product innovation, digital capabilities and capacity expansions.
Importantly, these cross-company initiatives to drive long-term growth and margin improvement as well as to free up additional funds for investment in our key priorities are ahead of schedule and have contributed to our growth and margin improvement in the quarter. With an even stronger 2021 outlook, we are accelerating investment behind our core strategies while also delivering margin improvement above our prior expectations. At the same time, we will maintain investment discipline, knowing that the pandemic is still ongoing and expansions do not always unfold in a linear way, so as to deliver consistent performance for our stakeholders.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we are positioning for a stronger long-term future. Starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the global and U.S. markets. The business accelerated through the first quarter of this year with sales have in excess of 30% in the quarter. These strong sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 24% OI margin, notwithstanding increased investment in brands, innovation and customer service. We experienced very strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. Even if we exclude China to isolate the first quarter of 2020's plumbing impact on the business, plumbing sales still grew in excess of 25%. 
Our loan brand continues to win in its core products and adjacencies. Our leading brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty metrics show non persistently resonates with the key millennial consumer. Our cutting-edge marketing is winning accolades, and we are investing more behind our powerful campaign. Our combination of advanced smart technology and on-trend designs drive share and profit growth as no one leads in defining the way humans will interact with water now and into the future.
We made significant progress as our flow line on technology rolled out into a key builder partner, and we also increased our retail distribution. We also further expanded Moen's smart home network with our Flo by Moen digital Sump Pump monitor, which won accolades at CES and the prestigious KBIS show. Our sustained investment in innovation, brand and channel with unrelenting focus on product delivery and service levels will continue to perpetuate the cycle of outperformance for North America's leading plumbing brand. 
Additionally, Moen China continues to outperform its market through channel and category expansion, while providing high levels of product quality and service to our customers. All of our channels grew double-digit versus their first quarter 2019 pre-COVID levels. We have rolled out increased brand investment in China and are seeing a very strong response to our campaign.
Finally, the House of ROHL were in excess of 25% globally despite continued restrictions and showroom capacity in the U.S. and rolling lockdowns in Canada and Europe. The positioning of these brands is authentic luxury plumbing collections resonates with consumers who are leveraging their own strong balance sheets to elevate and customize their kitchen and bathroom designs.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by over 45% and operating margin increased by over 300 basis points to 13.5%. Organic sales, which exclude our recent LARSON acquisition came in at an impressive 15% growth. These exceptional results were driven by very strong double-digit decking and doors growth, continued growth in security and exceptional execution across the segment.
With respect to LARSON, our teams are hard at work in integrating the business and capturing expected growth and synergies. The LARSON team is proving to be a wonderful fit with our Fortune Brands family. There is more work to do, but we are ahead of schedule, and our expectation of synergies from this addition to our portfolio are as good or better than we thought at the time we announced the transaction. 
Turning to decking. Fiberon grew in excess of 40%, an impressive feat during the winter period that normally includes some seasonal selling. Momentum in our decking brand has not only continued but is strengthening. Similar to other composite board makers, we continue to take increasing share from lumber decking products. Our investment thesis continues to be confirmed as distribution expansion, coupled with leveraging our percent brands advantage capabilities, positions Fiberon for long-term growth in the market, fueled by trends in housing, outdoor living and long-term material conversion from wood to higher-performing eco-friendly recycled materials. We remain on track to add capacity midyear as we drive double-digit top line growth across Viber.
With inflationary pressure on lumber over much over the last year, the price differential between commodity wood and branded engineered decking is negligible, contributing to a greater number of customers choosing Engineered Materials. That said, even as lumber pricing moderates, the cost benefit equation will continue to weigh heavily in favor of Engineered Materials and the value proposition will continue to improve through branding and innovation.
Sales in our legacy doors brand experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including robust demand in retail POS and increased wholesale activity as new construction ramped up during the quarter, leveraging our deeply developed channel. Our advantaged single-family new construction exposure is driving results at Therma-Tru and our team is working hard to supply increasing demand while navigating cost and supply chain challenges. 
Much like Fiberon, consumers are increasingly realizing the benefits of engineered products or the more traditional materials used in exterior doors and outdoor living. These conversion tailwinds will continue to power our Doors business well ahead of the market. Our new design tools, innovation and performance and functionality and the ability to customize through technologically-driven skins and coatings have expanded the opportunity set in this product category, where we have deepened our position as the #1 exterior door brand.
Turning to Security. Sales grew further this past quarter as commercial and international markets continue to open. Master Lock is continuing to demonstrate improved performance as it progresses its transformation under its new leadership. We are employing Fortune Brands advantage capabilities within our security operations to drive growth and operating margin improvement. In fact, securities performance this past quarter contributed to the success of overall margin progression in the segment versus a year ago. 
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets team again delivered excellent performance in the quarter. Sales grew low double digits for the third quarter in a row as single-family new construction and bigger ticket R&R increased. With strong growth across product lines at all price points, operating margins expanded by 180 basis points over prior year to 10.8%. Having impressive margin improvement was off of a strong Q1 last year as new construction activity produced seasonally strong results a year ago.
Our Cabinets business continues to demonstrate how our hard work over the past few years produces market-leading top line performance at increasing margins. We've considerably changed the way we look at both our current operations and view our future opportunities. Our work in our global low-cost supply chain is adding flexibility and resiliency to the business. We're building a scalable and cost-effective network across our platform with increased simplification and commonization driving both operating leverage and best-in-class service. We're winning share against a fragmented domestic market and against imports, which are coming in at higher cost and at longer lead times.
We're seeing growth at both ends of the press spectrum. Our cabinets per the plant now in the late innings positions our business extremely well to capitalize wherever demand materializes. In the first quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in both our make-to-order and value price categories. In our make-to-order business, we are seeing strong trends this past quarter in the U.S., led by premium price points and a nice return to performance in Canada as that housing market reaccelerates. Our best-in-class dealer network continues to deliver for us. Additionally, our Cabinet team is exploring new omnichannel opportunities and is accelerating investments in e-commerce.
Within our value price grid cabinets, we continue to gain share while optimizing our operations and offerings. During the quarter, demand was widespread in value cabinets across builder, dealer and retail channels. We made considerable progress in capacity and distribution with investments in the quarter in Mexico as well as the on-time opening of our new Southeast facility see surging demand in Mantra and other value-priced products. We expect another breakout year for our Mantra line in 2021, which serves the market previously addressed by importers with stylish short lead time product. 
Our Cabinet team has increased share by continuing to win in the market and is doing so on an advantaged replatformed cost base. More opportunity lies ahead, and the team is pursuing it with the same figure and tenacity that they have demonstrated over the last few years. We are well on our journey to drive our Cabinets business to our long-term goal of mid-teens margins.
In summary, our teams work tirelessly to deliver on our purpose fulfilling the dreams of home. And we take great pride in our impact on the quality of people's lives within the home. The world is not without challenges or risks, health, safety or otherwise. The home provides comfort, protection, respite and is a center for him a connection, whether it be work, school, entertaining or generally forming deeper relationships between friends and family. We are central to the role of the home and our private met role comes through in our brands, innovation and people every day. 
In addition to filling the dreams of home, our company is committed to doing its part to help improve the lives of those around us, to our environmental, social and governance efforts. Whether it's through our environmentally responsible products, leading safety record or diversity equity and inclusion initiatives, we are continually challenging ourselves to raise the bar. I encourage you to visit our website to see our recently released ESG report. 
Combined with attractive demographics, strong demand and low supply of homes, we expect a long-term multiyear tailwind for houses. As the market expands to fold the severe gap in housing supply, we expect to scale ahead of that demand and continue to take share, consistent with our long track record. Our innovative portfolio of products is targeted at the heart of the market and this broader channel exposure than ever before.
By leveraging our own actions to continuously improve the business and our premium resilience We intend to capture the upside of this multiyear expansion while managing any volatility that may come our way. With our exceptional team, leading brands, strong channel positions and powerful balance sheet, we are uniquely positioned to continue to drive accelerated value creation for our stakeholders.
Our updated and improved 2021 outlook reflects the strength of our business with robust growth translating to operating leverage and increased margins while we continue to invest for the long term. We expect to continue to outperform our markets in 2021 and beyond, while fully offsetting inflation and supply chain challenges to produce even stronger results. In addition, our powerful balance sheet positions us to continue to drive incremental value creation. We are excited for what our world-class brands and people can accomplish.
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results. Pat?"
33174798,710740606,2264038,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our first quarter results.Sales were $1.77 billion, up 26% from a year ago. O",1376,"Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our first quarter results.
Sales were $1.77 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Organic sales growth, excluding the LARSON acquisition, was up 19%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $262 million, up 54% or $92 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 270 basis points over the same quarter last year. EPS were $1.36 for the quarter, up 68% versus $0.81 the same quarter last year. Our associates focus on safety and outperforming a strong market drove these outstanding results.
The momentum of activity in our markets was strong throughout the quarter and remained strong. While we are working hard to service the robust demand across the portfolio, we are also taking action against material and freight inflation and supply chain imbalances. We expect to offset these challenges fully to deliver higher growth and greater profitability than we planned.
Our high-performing business model of leading brands and channel positions combined with further deployment of our Fortune Brands Advantage, drives both incremental investments and increased value to the bottom line for our stakeholders.
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the first quarter were $622 million, up $153 million or 33% or up 30% adjusting for FX. First quarter growth was up very strong double digits across all major brands, channels and geographies. Plumbing operating income increased 43% to $149 million for the first quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 24%, reflecting strong volume leverage despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to maintain service levels. We expect 2021 margins to be at or above 22% for the full year.
Turning to Outdoors & Securities. Sales for the first quarter were $462 million, up $148 million or 47%, driven by the addition of LARSON as well as strong double-digit growth in doors and decking and continued growth in security. On an organic basis, sales were up 15%. We expect all product categories to drive 2021 growth. Door sales were up double digits in the first quarter, driven by consistently strong retail sales and an accelerating new construction market. Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains achieved new performance levels. Demand in retail and wholesale channels remain strong. We are selling every board we can make. We are on pace to bring additional capacity online in the middle of this year and are looking for options to pull forward capacity plans from 2022 and beyond.
Security sales continued single-digit growth in the quarter with strength in retail and international markets. Commercial markets showed improvement throughout the quarter and are poised to continue to perform better throughout the remainder of the year. Outdoors & Securities segment operating income was $62 million during the quarter, up 91% over the same quarter last year driven by the addition of LARSON and performance improvement in doors, decking and security. Segment operating margin increased 310 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 13.5%.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the first quarter were $688 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter in 2020. We continue to experience strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced make-to-order products returned to double-digit growth in the quarter. This positive signal for big-ticket R&R reflects consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes.
Operating income in the first quarter was $75 million, up 34% or $19 million versus the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, up 180 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We expect Cabinets to deliver an average second half operating margin of 13% or greater as we benefit from our efforts to streamline operations and invest to capture additional share gain.
Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on material and cost inflation in the face of elevated demand and amid a backdrop of an accelerating housing market. We continue to deploy a multitude of tools to mitigate or offset inflation within our businesses. We do this through continuous cost improvement throughout our operations. We enacted major programs during the past year and are furthering those initiatives in 2021. We also employ cost sharing with suppliers where appropriate. Finally, when necessary, we act via price. Through this combination of actions, we plan to offset fully all inflationary headwinds this year and expect to deliver 2021 margin improvement and remain on an increasing margin trajectory over the next several years.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash of $356 million, net debt of $2.3 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now 2.1x. We ended the first quarter with approximately $755 million of total available liquidity. We have made and will continue to make significant investments. We are continuously assessing opportunities to deploy capital strategically to accelerate growth and stakeholder value creation. We will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks and our dividend, building on the over $1 billion of capital deployed during 2020.
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Given our continued outperformance and strengthening home products market, we are raising our market and financial outlook for the full year of 2021. Based on the expectation that the global market for our products will grow 9% to 11%, with the U.S. housing market growing 10% to 12%. And within this market forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 14% and U.S. R&R growth of 10% to 12%.
Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth is expected to be 20% to 22% or 13% to 15% on an organic basis. Our full year operating margin is expected to be around or above 15%. We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.45 to $5.65 on a before charge gain basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth in excess of 30% over a record year in 2020. 
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our updated guidance includes: Plumbing net sales growth of 15% to 17%, with operating margins at or above 22%; Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 43% to 47% or 11% to 13%, excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 15% to 16% or approximately 16% to 17% adjusted for purchase accounting and onetime integration expenses; Cabinet net sales growth of 11% to 13% with operating margins at or above 12%. 
We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $650 million to $700 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to drive growth across all of our segments. We anticipate a cash conversion rate between 85% and 95%. 
The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $104 million to $106 million, interest expense of approximately $82 million to $86 million, a tax rate of between 23% and 24%, and average fully diluted shares of approximately $140 million to $141 million.
We expect a long runway of fundamental housing growth to result in prolonged market strength for our products. We expect our sales to continue outperforming the market, which will accelerate our margin progression. Our strong balance sheet allows for us to continue to assess further opportunities to deploy capital strategically. We see multiple paths of future value creation to pursue for our stakeholders. Our company has never been better positioned to capture these opportunities. Our teams remain committed to driving market-beating sales performance and continued operating margin improvement.
Our revised 2021 guidance is solidly on the trajectory of the 3-year outlook reflected in our updated investor presentation. This outlook contains a compound annual sales growth rate of 8% to 11% and a 2023 operating margin target of 16% to 17% relative to a global market growth CAGR expectation of 6% to 8%.

Last quarter, I believe, Pat, you may have mentioned that by spring, you should have better line of sight in the back half of this year in terms of growth.

So we definitely expect growth in the back half, and we expect to outperform that growth. I put the market into context by half of the year. You heard our updated market guidance, which is, call it, roughly 10% for the full year. I'd characterize the first half is kind of mid-teens or better, and the back half is kind of mid-single digits or better from a market growth perspective. 
And then when you think about what that means for our sales across the halves of the year, we're thinking about reported sales growth in the first half averaging around 30% and reported sales growth in the back half averaging around 10%. So both first half and back half strength versus the market. And then even on an organic basis, a first half organic growth around 20% and a back half organic growth around high single-digit versus a mid-single-digit market. 
So we are expecting back half growth. We just see the strength in the housing market continue. We expect to continue to outperform it. I'd probably further clarify, LARSON is probably $450-ish million in there, with about $250 million of that coming in the first half, just to kind of give you the way we see the year unfolding right now.
And I do think, at least it seems like it's tracking this way for the first half, but it seems also likely to track this way for the back half of the year, where on a quarter-by-quarter basis, looking at it in stacked margin versus those averages are helpful ways to look at these."

I mean, you stated it's true for Cabinet. It's true for the entire portfolio. I mean, the strength was just so broad-based across all products, channels and geographies. It was really impressive. Really nice to see it come through in make-to-order cabinets side and really being -- as we said in the prepared remarks, really led by premium, which I think tells us something about how the consumer is thinking about investing in their house. The confidence that they have in home values and liquidity. 
And so that's rolling through very nicely. Now as we've talked about previously, I mean, we did a lot of work around the supply chain. We talked a lot about the work that we did on the value side to create a highly competitive global supply chain. We've also done a lot of work on the made-to-order side to kind of take out unnecessary complexity, to simplify wherever we can, commonize where we can, and that is helping compound a lot of the margin accretion in the business. 
The work is far from done. Dave and his team continue to identify more and more opportunities to go after that. But it's well underway and it's well understood. And so as you start to see volume flow through that made-to-order, we'll see benefit there, certainly, as you point out on a dollar perspective and then also have plans to drive the margins further.

When people are buying more premium-priced cabinetry, it just shows the confidence they have in their home, in their home values and their willingness to invest in their homes. So I think it's a great overall kind of market strength signal. 
I think when you talk about percentages, the Cabinets team is trying to drive both the make-to-order and the stock business to the mid-teens margin of the whole Cabinet portfolio. As you point out, though, in the make-to-order side you sell in the boxes at 2x to 3x, sometimes even more than 3x the cost of the stock boxes. So the dollar profit is quite substantially higher, which allows you to leverage SG&A much more significantly. So to the extent the level of strength we're seeing continues, that will be a powerful SG&A leverage and kind of upside to the next couple of years."

But how much additional breathing room to the investments that you expect to come online midyear give you this year given that it sounds like you're already sort of eyeing additional investments? Could you just go into a little more detail on the runway you have and the plans to support multiyear growth in a category that doesn't seem to be showing any signs of slowing down?"

But the first thing, we absolutely are pushing hard and getting everything we can out the door. And you're not wrong on pricing. I think -- although if you find -- as we build out the fiber on brand, we are really trying to work on leading in pricing. I think that's important. This is a high-value proposition for consumers, and it is one that is driven both by brand and by innovation. 
And so it's taking from commoditized, unbranded wood with a much higher value proposition, and that deserves a premium. And so I think there's that equation and keeping that equation right, so the value always sits in favor of the consumer. But I think there is a pricing opportunity. And I think you'll see us start to develop a really good track record at driving that. 
And then as you think about the capacity, yes, we do have more coming online, and we're looking to pull more into 2021 from 2022 and into '22 from '23. The way we've been able to approach it has been fairly incremental: a, investing to get more capacity and more efficiency out of the assets we have. I think under Fortune Brands ownership, we're getting a far greater efficiency level out of those assets and have plans to continue to increase that. 
And then as we add capacity for us, it's sort of a extruder at a time. And so it's a very manageable approach to adding that capacity. These are not giant, giant big bites that we have to take. That said, there may come a time where we do want to add an incrementally larger footprint. But that's also something we know how to do. I mean, we open facilities all the time, and so I think we feel we can do that fairly efficiently.
And so we feel good about what we're adding this year. That said, I'm pretty bullish. It sounds like year or 2 in the category, so I don't expect that we'll find ourselves overcapacitized anytime this year or next year. Our plans are to meet the market. But as we continue to gain share, we continue to sell out at the capacity we have.

The tailwind in the quarter sort of implies that it was a little bit more than 25% of the run rate sales that was discussed around the acquisition. Is there anything -- I mean, I know there was the accrual account for kind of the last couple of weeks of 2020, but it still doesn't really seem large enough to explain the sales in the quarter. 
So was it just a stronger spring selling season in the Doors category? Or how should we think about, I guess, the cadence of the tailwind for the rest of the year?"

And so as I said in the prepared remarks, the acquisition has been even better than expected. The team is fantastic, and they're integrating really, really well.

I'm happy to do that, and then I'll pass to Pat to give you some more particulars on it. 
But we saw -- as we looked across the portfolio, and really, did this as a team, late '19 or early '20, we've said what could we do from a business model perspective across Fortune Brands to really elevate the whole? And as we did that, we identified pockets of things that we were actually, a, doing really well and, b, investing behind. I mean, we're not just doing it very good at it, but we were doing it well because we were putting the dollars and the people behind building capabilities. 
But we were doing it in pockets, and yet, these were things that were easily leverageable across the whole business. And so we really organized as a whole executive team against the Fortune Brands advantage to leverage these capabilities. And so things like category management. I mean, if you look at our categories, right, we're -- with very few exceptions, we're the leader. And in those other exceptions, we're a top 3 in all of our categories. And so as such, we should be able to bring category insights, understand how a shelf is set, how we engage consumers, what works best for them, where the innovation lies, price elasticities. And so how do we become really a category management leader and build that up.
The other is global sourcing. I mean, we're a manufacturer and a global sourcer. We have a very complex global supply chain. There are sourcing skills and capabilities that can really not just improve the cost basis, and they can do that in a very big way, but also the quality and resiliency of the sourcing base in a business. And so we've invested quite heavily and centrally to build out teams to go off those opportunities. And when I say investment, this could be single-digit million, but really that's driving double-digit millions over time.
And then the third one today is really around business simplification and leveraging tools likely, and like 80/20, but doing it in a more consistent way across the business, consistent training, speaking the same language, understanding the value chain and where we're going to get value. And so the vision is, as we really drive these, over time, these will just be the language we speak, these will be the skills we have, the capabilities. We'll embed them into the business, and then be able to kind of germinate new capabilities under the Fortune Brands Advantage umbrella that are going to help drive growth, right? 
And we're looking really hard right now at investments we're making in digital. We have unique insights across the very broad portfolio that we have about what's happening in the housing market that we can drill down to. We built the data lake across all of our products. You can see POS in everything that we do and start to fare that trend very quickly. 
So we're very excited about this. And I think we wanted to start concretely, get some wins on the board, and then really build momentum behind this business model over time."

Truman, inflation has been intense across materials and freight. For us, specifically, things like metal, hardwood and freight have probably been the most extensive, but certainly, petroleum-based resins have been challenges as well, as much from the Texas storm as from different places in perspective. 
So if you tease them out, last year, 2020, our full year COGS base was about $3.9 billion. And I'll tell you that inflation this year is going to be in the kind of 4.5% to 5% of COGS range. And much of that is yet to come. I mean, we probably have less than 20% of that flow through our Q1 P&L. Much of it, therefore, you're talking more than 80% is going to flow through the balance of the year. 
And we are -- we're going to offset it with a combination of cost actions, and where necessary, price over the balance of the year. I think you should expect that across all 4 quarters. We'll show a measure of margin improvement. It will be tightest during Q2, in part just because freight really surged again kind of at the very end of last year and in Q1. And we're going to be doing things to expedite components and other products for our customers. We'll be absorbing some unique levels of freight inflation in the second quarter. But we do expect to make margin progress in the second quarter and make margin progress for the full year."

Really remarkable. And I think as you see the market gap to our performance and you see the outperformance of our business increase in an environment like this, a lot of that is really attributable to that team and their ability to keep our customers supplied. 
And they've been at it for a long time now. I mean, if you go back to plywood tariffs in 2017, where we had to change out $100 million with the buy out of China into other geographies and do it very quickly, they've really become world-class experts at managing this. And so they're just excellent. And that's what gives us the confidence to basically say we'll manage this."

As I said a little bit earlier in the call, too, I think stacked growth quarter-by-quarter will be pretty helpful way to look at things. So if you recall, last year, we were down about 9% top line in the second quarter. And as I said, we're going to be averaging about 30% across the first half in terms of reported sales growth. So backing that up, that means down 9% last year second quarter, then up about high 30s to approaching 40 this year, getting to that stack 30% for the second quarter. And then similarly, on the organic basis, kind of averaging about 20% across the first half of the year.
The one thing I would point out is last year, while we were down 9% in the second quarter, we had really good expense and cash management in that down quarter, and our operating margin last year, with sales down was 14.3%. So we managed our bottom line very effectively during the second quarter. We'll still make a margin progression this quarter because all of our teams are working very hard on driving the business forward and contributing to the full year margin expansion of around 100 basis points, but it will be 50 basis points or less during that second quarter, I'd say, in terms of margin expansion."

I'll take it and maybe Nick could give some color. 
I'll start with what is the mix signal about the market and I think as -- especially as you've seen, housing activity in suburbs, in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Upper Midwest, where you have people moving from cities out into suburbs at housing price points that are relatively high and having a lot of confidence in the ability of both housing value to sustain and their desire to invest in their home, because they're going to probably be spending a bit more time there than they expected to be, it gives a lot of great signal at the housing market in terms of people investing in larger single-family homes than doing it in a premium fashion is well underway. 
And it's nice relative to the last housing expansion. This is really not happening with unsustainable home equity loans or something like that. This is people, for the most part, using cash to do it. So I think it's a great signal for the market.
I think in terms of mix and how to think about it from our business, we've been working as we've been preparing for the millennial generation to make entry price point and mid-price point products on a percentage basis every bit as attractive as premium-priced products. So we've been trying to make across our portfolio, our ability to increase margins a possibility, even if it was a lot of millennials buying opening price point product. 
So we try to not overplay mix. But as we talked about with some of the questions, I think we got to with Phil, on an absolute dollar basis, if you're selling a $1,000 faucet instead of a $200 faucet, even that's a same percentage margin, obviously, it's a lot more dollars. And so I think the upside that you're pointing to is it really allows you to leverage your fixed cost base. 
And so if we were to see a pronounced and sustained mix in premium, there'll probably be upside to some of the figures we've given out there because it'd be reasonable to assume it's kind of new news, and therefore, it's kind of not in our multiyear assumption, some massive mix shift. And if that does perpetuate and sustain at the levels it's had recently, it would be upside. Just leveraging fixed cost base off of higher absolute dollar contribution per unit."

So we're not seeing any abatement in the trends in kind of the core portfolio. All of this is coming in addition to, which is really positive. And where -- you look at where it's coming from, and as Pat referenced, some of those markets are a lot healthier home equity levels are high. There's a degree of confidence. 
Also some of our builder partners have pointed out, where there's sort of first few years of the millennial buyer was really focused on that entry-level price point, you're now having some first-time homebuyers for millennials but are fairly deep into their careers and are buying homes that were previously considered kind of second upgrade-type homes and sort of coming in and really building out those houses with sort of every option available. And so that, I think, combined with some of the value that you're seeing, the Boomer, Generation, Gen X kind of put back into homes as their confidence has increased and the home is really, really generally a very aged. 
Housing stock gives us more and more confidence around the premium of that portfolio, so it's very exciting but margins are fairly comparable. But certainly, dollars are higher and a lot of design cues come out of having that portfolio that we leverage across everything."

I'll give you some color on the -- firstly, we don't comment on particular timing of price increases kind of on a product-by-product basis. But I would refer you in my comments earlier that you have seen Fiberon start to really take a leadership position on pricing in the category. And this is a product that we -- when we purchased it, it really had built out its business at the entry level of deck board and our opportunity was really to move up the price spectrum. And as we built out the wholesale distribution that supports that not just in wholesale, but also in retail, which fills special order through our wholesale partners. 
And so there's both a pricing opportunity in decking as well as a really good mix opportunity in decking. And just to come in the earlier conversation that we're having, this is an area where you see better margin as you move up the price spectrum. And so we think that is a nice opportunity. And so I think on both, you may see some tailwinds.
With respect to the imports, if you look -- a couple of things I'd point out. One is broadly stabilized from a volume perspective. And so from a volume perspective, kind of comparable to where it was pre -- there was a big run up in imports of -- to the antidumping cases filed as importers try to bring a ton of inventory in, where it's stabilized now, is well below that. It's sort of the volume -- the sort of dollar levels where it was running previously. 
A couple of things that are different, though. While dollar levels are the same, our read on pricing in the market is that it's significantly higher than it was kind of back in '18. And so we believe that volume is a lot less than it was. And secondly, we make up a greater share of those imports to our global supply chain than we did then. And so on a volume perspective, while dollars have stabilized and have been coupled to that period volume, we think is quite a fair amount down. 
But the really important thing about it and why it isn't impacting us is while, to a degree, it's been replaced, it's been replaced by importers who have product with longer lead times, less few availability and more cost. And whether it's more cost because they're legitimately competing or whether it's more cost because their tranche-shipping, it doesn't really matter. It's adding enough cost to the system. 
And we always said that we were going to build a global supply chain. It didn't rely on government intervention. It was going to be cost competitive no matter what. And so it's proving to be very cost against imports, and we find that dealers are continuing to come to us looking for replace the product at an accelerating rate.
The other thing I'd call out is customs is really ramping enforcement against the tranche shippers. And I think that's going to even have a further damping effect on imports as we go forward. So the combination of that antidumping case, but more importantly, the work that we did when we platformed our whole global supply chain, has had the intended effect. And you've seen that come through in both the top line and margin numbers now."

I hope that you are all enjoying your summer while continuing to stay safe and healthy. 
Our teams once again delivered an exceptional quarter driving outperformance on both the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter results demonstrated that we are delivering market-leading growth and margin progression even in the face of numerous external challenges. We remain on track to achieve both our near- and long-term performance objectives across all metrics. 
For the quarter, our company sales increased 41% in total and 32% organically with all segments driving strong growth. That includes organic growth of 21% versus 2019 and over 9% sequentially versus our excellent first quarter of 2021. Current demand for our products remains robust, and our teams continue to drive accelerated share gains across the portfolio. 
Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 15.4% and earnings per share increased 66%. Headwinds from inflation and supply chain constraints were significant in the quarter, making these results even more remarkable. Across our company, we are diligently working to meet them on and keep our customers served with our industry-leading brands. On the back of a strong market and our accelerating the outperformance, we are again increasing our full year 2021 sales and EPS guidance while maintaining our operating margin goal of around 15%. Pat will go into further detail on our increased guidance later in the call. 
While this quarter provided an easier comp given the COVID-related shutdowns in North America and Europe last year,  each segment also delivered sequential sales growth and operating margin improvement versus a strong first quarter of 2021. We now expect full year organic sales growth to be in the high teens as favorable demand trends persist. We continue to deliver on our strategic agenda, including accelerating our margin improvement and growth initiatives via our Fortune Brands and Vantage capabilities while also investing for future growth to drive increasing stakeholder value. 
These outstanding results would not have been possible without our exceptional team of people who continue to make the difference: Putting safety first, going above and beyond to serve our channel partners and customers and operating with a culture of excellence. Thank you to all who work hard each day, standing proudly behind our world-class brands that make an increasingly positive impact on people's homes, safety and communities. 
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we are seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our second quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as thoughts around our increased guidance to our financial outlook for the year. 
Now, turning to our view on the housing market. The long-term fundamentals for U.S. housing and home products remain very favorable. The U.S. housing stock is underbuilt by millions of homes, and builders are currently pacing orders and managing backlogs to alleviate constraints on labor, commodities and affordability while completing communities under construction. Though demand remains extremely robust, this pacing will result in a further elongation of demand that will provide long-term momentum to many of our leading brands, which are the preferred choice for builders and the trade. 
Our strong positioning across all channels, including the wholesale and dealer channel, which service pros and builders is differentiating us and gives us exposure to the additional torque from new construction growth. With lower inventory and builders facing supply, homeowners are buying existing homes from a very aged housing stock requiring repair and remodel investment. We have seen the strengthening of larger ticket R&R as the channels historically serving that demand have more fully opened. 
Within the retail channel, there has been some market commentary regarding demand normalizing and consumer spending shifting to other categories as the economy opens further. While the retail channel may be showing some recent signs of normalization for certain product categories, demand is shifting back towards the trade channels that were largely closed at this time last year. We are still expecting robust activity for the remainder of the year, as reflected by our increased market and financial guidance.
As we continue to make progress in our objectives, it is important not to lose sight of the long term demographic tailwinds supporting this prolonged housing boom. The two largest segments of the population, Millennials and Baby Boomers, both have significant need for housing and home products. 
Millennials, the largest segment of the population will be a great force for years to come in forming and upgrading households, accelerating the need for homebuilding and driving investment in new homes and R&R. This demographic is still in the early stages of fueling housing growth. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers are retiring large numbers with record equity in their homes and retirement accounts, and are upgrading and adjusting their homes for their next phase of life. 
Given the sheer size of these demographics and severity of the U.S. under build, we expect these fundamentals to play out over many years to come. Our portfolio is excellently positioned from a product mix, price point and channel exposure standpoint to take advantage of the long-term secular trends in new construction and R&R. We intend to outperform this market, consistent with our long track record. 
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. As I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter. Our leading brands continue to resonate with consumers who are looking for world-class products driven by purpose and innovation. When consumers buy our products, they expect more than just functionality. They buy our brands because our brands are built with purpose. When they buy Moen,  they're buying a brand that continuously innovates to advance water efficiency and conservation. When they buy fiber on decking, they are buying eco-friendly composite boards that are over 94% made from recycled materials. When they buy MasterBrand Cabinets, they're buying quality craftsmanship using responsibly sourced materials. Our Therma-Tru door systems are energy efficient and our security products keep people and possessions safe. 
This sense of purpose and greater good for all resonates from our amazing employee base. Our recent ESG report has received accolades from investors, and I am very proud of the contributions our brands and people make to the environment and our communities. We are committed to doing even more in the future. 
Operationally, we continue to execute our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities that fund investment in key growth priorities including in our brand building and product innovation, digital initiatives and capacity and distribution expansion. Those capabilities are contributing to our outperformance in the first half of 2021 and will continue to accelerate in the years ahead. 
Inflation, whether it be from material, freight or labor, increased as we move through the second quarter. However,  as you can see from our strong performance, we are pulling every lever available to us to offset these headwinds and serve our customers. We prioritize our continuous improvement in supply chain programs to offset inflation and then turn to price where necessary. We've been thoughtful about where and when we take price so as to maintain constructive customer relationships. 
As we have demonstrated over the past few years, our brands and products are desired by consumers and are capable of sustaining price increases while growing share. Our ability to mitigate and overcome challenges, whether demand, supply or inflationary in nature, has been proven through our consistent delivery of results. 
We will continue to be laser-focused on execution, driving stakeholder value across the organization no matter the environment. I mentioned it in the last quarter and I will state it again: We are committed to offsetting inflationary and supply chain headwinds for the full year. With an even stronger 2021 outlook, we are accelerating investment behind our core strategies to continually deliver market-leading growth and margin expansion over the long run. 
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we're positioning for long-term growth, starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to significantly outperform the global and U.S. markets this past quarter, taking share in every geographic region in which we operate. The business is firing on all cylinders, with sales growth of 38% -- or 33%, excluding FX. Our strong Plumbing sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 24.3% operating margin for the quarter, notwithstanding increased investment in brand, innovation and customer service. 
To put this margin performance into context, we delivered these results inclusive of increased brand investment of low double-digit millions over last year and significant expenditures related to improving our service levels to our customers. We achieved very strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. We are winning share and generating incremental investment dollars to pursue further above market growth and margin in both North America and in China. 
In North America, our Plumbing business has never been stronger. We continue to be an industry leader in both innovation and key metrics on brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty among customers. Our momentum in the smart home plumbing market, including continued adoption by builders, insurance companies and consumers of our flow by Moen technology is driving further core growth, propelling the flywheel of top and bottom line performance. 
In China, Moen achieved double-digit growth on a very tough comp to Q2 last year as the Chinese market was reopening in this quarter a year ago. We continue to invest to position on as a leading brand with Chinese consumers and are increasing our total addressable market by expanding our product adjacencies. We are also making incremental investments in capacity and distribution. 
Finally, the House of ROHL sales nearly doubled globally and increased double digits sequentially in all regions. The brand has achieved these results despite many showrooms remaining appointment only. We're seeing a clear uptrend in premium and luxury demand, not only in Plumbing, but across our entire portfolio, signaling consumer demand is strengthening for big-ticket R&R. 
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by over 60% and operating margin was 14.7%. Organically, sales increased 26%. These exceptional results were driven by strong double-digit decking and security growth and double-digit growth in Doors. Supply chain and labor availability continue to impact operations across multiple brands within this segment. Our teams are hard at work to offset these headwinds, which held us back from achieving full capacity production. 
Integration of LARSON continues to progress well, and the business is performing as we expected. As with our other operations, the LARSON team met the supply chain in select material availability constraints in the quarter head on. Our teams across Outdoors and Security are working together to advance integration while capturing planned synergies. 
Turning to decking. Fiberon grew nearly 30% for the second quarter versus a strong quarter a year ago, and we continue to operate in a sold-out environment. Incremental midyear capacity will be utilized quickly, and we continue to take price and accelerate capacity expansion plans.  Market share conversion from lumber to higher-performing eco-friendly composites continue to trend higher. 
Sales in Doors experienced double-digit growth in the quarter and would have been even better had operations not been constrained by labor and materials. As a leader in serving the new construction market, activity remained robust as it had for much of the past year. Similar to our decking operations, we're currently in near sold-out conditions and are working to optimize our supply chains to meet this high level of demand. 
Turning to Security. Sales accelerated this past quarter, growing strong double digits versus a year ago and led by U.S. retail POS and the continued recovery of commercial and international markets. Our key North American retail market is back above 2019 levels, and we continue to leverage Fortune Brands advantage capabilities within Security to drive our momentum. 
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets operations again delivered excellent performance in the past quarter, with sales growing 31% and operating margin of 10.9%. Even when compared to a very strong first quarter, the business achieved sales and operating margin growth. This now marks 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit above-market growth as the market leader. Demand is impressive in both value and make to order. Our current record backlog in cabinets is a clear sign of the strong demand for our products. 
Our advantage dealer network has continued to drive increasing sales and margin progression for much of the past year. Additionally, our new facility in Georgia is fully open in ramping up production to serve demand. Mantra continues to perform well and is demonstrating the competitiveness of our low-cost global supply chain. 
In addition to strong demand, both Fortune Brands and Vantage capabilities and a culture of continuous improvement have driven Cabinets' performance. We are on track to continue margin progression this year and in the future as we progress towards our goal of mid-teens margins as the market leader in the industry. 
In summary, we continue to see very strong demand for our products driven by fundamentals and demographics. Our performance has been accelerated by the strength and culture of our company, brand building and consumer-led innovation, expertise in channel development and a relentless focus on people, execution and continuous improvement. The operating environment has been quite challenging in 2021, but it was also challenging a year ago. We have faced these challenges head on and have planned for future scenarios with our eyes wide open. While there may be other short-term obstacles and bumps in this long-term multiyear housing expansion, our team has proven its ability to overcome and emerge stronger, time and time again. 
In addition to outperforming operationally, we are also well positioned with a strong balance sheet to continue to pursue future growth, whether organically or inorganically. Our stakeholders can count on our experienced management team to continue to create value regardless of the environment. We expect to capture the upside of the long-term expansion in housing as we continue to build a great company for our stakeholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results and updated guidance. Pat?"

As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.94 billion, up 41% from a year ago.",1481,"Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. 
Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.94 billion, up 41% from a year ago. Organic sales growth, excluding the LARSON acquisition, was up 32%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $298 million, up 51% or $101 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 15.4%, up 110 basis points over the same quarter last year. 
EPS were $1.56 for the quarter, up 66% versus $0.94 the same quarter last year. It is important to note that our associates focus on safety and a culture of outperformance drove these outstanding results. Demand has remained strong across product categories, with growing strength in larger ticket and contractor-installed products. Headwinds from increasing material and freight inflation, as well as supply chain and labor inefficiencies are being addressed head on, as reflected in our results. We are taking additional actions during the second half, and our teams are working tirelessly to address these challenges. 
Our advantaged business model of leading brands and channel positions across a portfolio of products is providing synergistic benefits as we navigate this environment. We are executing above market, and our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities enable us to deliver strong results for the company and our stakeholders. 
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $695 million, up $190 million or 38% -- or 33% adjusting for FX. Second quarter growth was up very strong double digits across all major brands, channels and geographies. 
Plumbing operating income increased 37% to $169 million for the second quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.3%, despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to service our customers. We expect 2021 margins to be above 22% for the full year. 
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the second quarter were $536 million, up $203 million or 61%, driven by the addition of LARSON as well as strong double-digit growth in security and decking, and continued double-digit growth in Doors. On an organic basis, sales were up 26%. 
Door sales were up double digits in the quarter, driven by consistently strong retail POS and an accelerating new construction market. Reported sales results would have been even stronger within the quarter, if not for labor and material constraints, the latter of fading impact of the Texas storms. Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains in wholesale continued to drive results. Demand continues to exceed production capacity and we are selling every board we can make. We expect this will continue as additional capacity comes online in the fourth quarter, and we are accelerating future capacity expansion plans. 
Security sales significantly rebounded with over 40% growth in the quarter, with continued strength in retail and a welcome pickup in the commercial market. 
Outdoors and Security operating income was $79 million during the quarter, up 64% over the same quarter last year driven by the addition of LARSON and operating improvements in decking and security. Segment operating margin increased 30 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 14.7%. 
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the second quarter were $706 million, an increase of 31% over the same quarter in 2020. We again saw strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced, make-to-order products accelerated in the quarter. This positive signal for big-ticket R&R reflects consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. 
Operating income in the second quarter was $77 million, up 74% or $33 million versus the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.9%, up 270 basis points versus the same period a year ago. 
Before turning to the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance, I would like to address the topic of increasing inflation as well as inefficiencies in supply chain and labor markets as we continue to execute in this period of long-term sustainable housing growth. While inflation headwinds were anticipated, they continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking incremental actions during the second half of the year to offset increased inflation. We always first challenge ourselves to drive enhanced cost savings then when necessary, utilize price. 
As inflation has intensified, we remain thoughtful regarding price increases. We seek to keep our channel partners and products competitive and to minimize disruption if and when off-cycle pricing becomes necessary. That said, our brands and products continue to demonstrate their ability to drive share gains while commanding additional price. 
Through this combination of cost and thoughtful pricing actions, we plan to offset all inflationary headwinds this year and expect to deliver 2021 operating margin improvement. We remain on our '21 and long-term margin improvement trajectory. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash of $460 million, net debt of $2.1 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now at 1.7x. We ended the second quarter with approximately $430 million of available capacity on our revolver. We are in a strong financial position to continue to deploy capital to benefit our company and stakeholders. 
We have made and will continue to make significant investment both in our core Fortune Brands advantage capabilities as well as into our brands through continued innovation, production capacity and distribution enhancements. We also recently announced an additional authorization to repurchase common stock. The new 2-year authorization allows for the purchase of up to an incremental 400 million of common stock. We have purchased approximately 156 million through the first half of the year. And as always, we'll be strategic and opportunistic when purchasing shares. We remain focused on deploying capital effectively to accelerate stakeholder value creation. 
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Given our continued outperformance and a strong home products market, we are raising our market and financial outlook for the year of 2021. Based on the expectation that the global market for our products will now grow 10% to 12%, with the U.S. housing market growing 11% to 13% and within this market forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 14% and U.S. R&R growth of 11% to 13%. Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth is expected to be 23% to 25%, or 16% to 18% on an organic basis. 
Our full year operating margin is expected to remain around 15%. We expect second half operating margin to average around 15%, similar to the 15.1% achieved during the first half. The third quarter is expected to experience modest margin compression while fourth quarter margin is expected to expand as midyear actions reflect more fully in our income statement. We continue to target meaningful margin progress during '21 and are tracking to our long-term margin objectives, demonstrating our ability to accelerate value creation regardless of the environment. 
We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.65 to $5.85 on a before charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth of 37% over our record 2020. Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our updated guidance includes: Plumbing net sales growth of 21% to 23%, with operating margins above 22%; Outdoors and Security net sales growth of 44% to 48%, or 14% to 16%, excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 15% to 16%, or approximately 16% to 17% adjusting for purchase accounting; Cabinets net sales growth of 13% to 15%, with operating margins approaching 12%. 
We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $675 million to $725 million, which includes additional investments in capacity to accelerate growth. We anticipate a cash conversion rate of 80% to 90%. 
The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $104 million to $106 million; interest expense of approximately $83 million to $86 million; a tax rate of between 23% and 24%, with a second half tax rate more in line with our longer-term rate of around 25%; and average fully diluted shares of approximately $140 million to $141 million. Our increased forecast represents the outperformance of our business in a strong market, including continued share gains and positive operating leverage. In addition, our relentless focus on internal improvement and driving synergies across our portfolio will enable us to extend our continued best-in-class track record. 
Our fortress balance sheet will continue to allow us to pursue internal and external growth, and we are actively assessing opportunities to do so. We expect to outperform a long-term housing expansion and cannot be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
I will now pass the call back to Dave to conclude our prepared remarks."

I was hoping to get a sense of you mentioned that you're pursuing some incremental actions to offset the incremental inflation in the back half. I was hoping -- and you always kind of talked about balancing cost savings with price increases, I was hoping maybe to get a sense of when you think about the incremental headwind that you're seeing in the back half. How much are you expecting to offset through cost versus price? 
And also, perhaps more broadly, if you could talk about perhaps on the cost side and operational excellence, productivity, how some of the Fortune Brands advantage programs and initiatives are contributing to that ability to offset."
33174798,1673288843,2353349,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Mike. This is Nick, I'll start and give you some thoughts conceptually. And Pat can fill in some of the detail. But as you all know -- and as you've noted, I mean, the business continues to perform and demonstrate its resilience notwithstanding the",685,"Sure, Mike. This is Nick, I'll start and give you some thoughts conceptually. And Pat can fill in some of the detail. But as you all know -- and as you've noted, I mean, the business continues to perform and demonstrate its resilience notwithstanding the environment. And so we're seeing a really strong market, and we're seeing some very large inflationary pressures as well as just supply chain disruption that continues -- that's been widely reported. 
And yes, if you step back for a second ago, well, how does the business continue to perform, a lot of this stems from the fact that we are on a margin improvement journey, and we're doing it very programmatically and very deliberately, and we're leveraging it across the whole business. And so I think if you were to take us -- we were just ecstatic and we're just trying to hold the line and then you might see buffering from outside forces. But since the business is so geared towards a continuous improvement mindset and taking these Fortune Brands advantages and deploying them throughout the business, we're able to see those benefits come through even in a challenging environment. 
And so if I take -- Fortune Brands at once, for example, you have 3 big products, business simplification, you've got category management and you've got global sourcing, right? And 2 of those, business simplification and global sourcing really do drive, I'd say, both business resilience and cost improvement. 
And so coming into the year, we had significant plans to take those and leverage them throughout the business in different places, in different pockets. And it goes down to the desire, as I said before, I mean, this is backed by investments we've made in building the capabilities, in building the teams. So for example, just this year, we hired a Fortune Brands, center of excellence in global sourcing, drove material number of people that we're continuing to build out that team. 
And so by doing that, we had the business on a trajectory where we're able to drive cost improvement, as well as improve the quality of the supply chain [indiscernible] the complexity out. And what you find is that suppliers that are able to work with us to meet the sort of input costs that we're looking for actually tend to be the better suppliers. And so where we put these programs in place, we actually found the business is actually more resilient at lower cost versus less resilient. 
And so that is a big underpinning of the progress that we've been able to make. And then, of course, if that doesn't cover everything, as we've said, we do look to take price. Now we try not to do it outside of our regular cadence. We certainly had to this year. I think what price has spoken to is the strength of the brand and the strength of our channel management, because despite the fact that we've taken price, we continue to gain share, which is telling you that the value equation still sits very much in favor of the consumer. 
We're innovating -- we're adding a lot of value to our products. We're building brands so we're able to take price to where we have looked in the prices gone in, and I'm sure you guys are doing your channel checks and you're seeing that, and it's being well received. We're just trying to do it in a way that's as constructive as possible, notwithstanding the headwinds that we're facing. 
So it's a really programmatic approach. And I think the fact that we've taken a more programmatic approach is really paying off now. What I'll tell you is particularly exciting about it is, from my perspective, we're just getting started. I mean these are investments that we've made over the last couple of years. We're just building out these teams, and we're just getting rolling and that momentum will build over time. And so we expect it to continue to deliver for the business for a very long time to come. Pat, do you have anything?"
33174798,1673288843,2353349,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Mike, you're hearing your question trying to get to the numbers of it all. When we talked at the end of the last quarter, we talked about commodity, freight and tariff inflation in the range of 4% to 5% of COGs. We're probably in the range of 6-plus",373,"Yes. Mike, you're hearing your question trying to get to the numbers of it all. When we talked at the end of the last quarter, we talked about commodity, freight and tariff inflation in the range of 4% to 5% of COGs. We're probably in the range of 6-plus percent of COGs. So you're starting to talk a dollar amount that's approaching $250 million working on with all components, tariffs are pretty minor part of that, they're pretty static year-over-year. But both freight and commodity is a big chunk of that. 
We don't break down what chunk is cost versus what chunk is priced. They're both contributing very significantly to us offsetting that. And we totally -- we plan to totally offset that this year. Nick kind of point us to the margin journey we're on. As Nick said, we're pointing still towards 16% to 17% margin by 2023, which is 7-basis-plus points a year, plus of margin improvement, and we're tracking that this year. This year, we'll use cost and price on the variable side to get after the variable inflation, and we'll lever the structural cost savings we made the last couple of years, especially in Cabinets and a few other of our businesses and continue to make in our businesses and volume to lever towards the margin improvement this year. They'll both be driving the margin improvement this year. 
And what I'd say is we're 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year quarterly margin improvement. And we expect to keep margin on that, though the third quarter will present some challenges.  This year, of that 6% margin inflation, about 70% of it will hit during the second half with a disproportionate chunk in the third quarter. And so the back half will be about a 15-ish percent margin to complement the front half, to deliver somewhere around that for the full year. But we'll probably be 30 to 60 basis points down in operating margin for the third quarter, but then probably 30 to 60 basis points of margin up in the fourth quarter to deliver a back half that's right around 15%. And go into next year solidly on the ground to keep making progress towards our longer-term goal."

I guess maybe taking a step back strategically, you mentioned in terms of your free cash flow deployment. As always, you evaluate a combination of share repurchase and bolt-on M&A. Obviously, in the last couple -- 3, 4 years, you've really bolstered the Outdoor & Security segment, that follows before that, kind of building out or rounding out a little bit on the plumbing side. 
How should we think about the opportunity set over the next 2 or 3 or 4 years across your different segments or portfolios? It seems like Cabinets has certainly been on the quieter side. I think the last major one was Norcraft, way back when. Plumbing, you've obviously made some very nice add-ons with the House of ROHL now rolled up into that. 
Just curious if there's anything left perhaps to think about or expect on the Plumbing side, or is it really more just building out opportunistically the outdoor portfolio? And specifically on the Outdoor, I'm particularly curious if there's any product categories that perhaps we should be thinking about?"

I'm happy to give you some perspectives. And you like point out we're well aware of the strong cash generation and [indiscernible] be very thoughtful about ways in which we can continue to create value to our stakeholders here. And our priorities",690,"Sure. I'm happy to give you some perspectives. And you like point out we're well aware of the strong cash generation and [indiscernible] be very thoughtful about ways in which we can continue to create value to our stakeholders here. 
And our priorities remain the same. I mean, first and foremost, we look to our own business and CapEx opportunities to grow and drive the strategic priorities. And I think at this level of growth, we see opportunities there to continue to invest behind it, which are pretty exciting. And we look M&A. And then where we don't find good M&A opportunities, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
On M&A, I'll say the pipeline is robust, and it's as robust as I've seen in a very long time, if not ever. And so there's a lot of stuff out there. We're going to remain disciplined and look for places where we can fit [indiscernible] that's the bar we hold very high for.
The areas that are of interest remain the same, certainly Outdoors and Security. We're very excited about opportunities in the outdoor space. Our focus on that where things that you historically think of in terms of Fortune Brands, where we believe we can create a brand, where there can be structural advantage, where we can leverage our channel know-how, are the areas which we'll focus. There are other areas in Outdoor that we've looked at, that we've decided are more commoditized and are not worth pursuing. 
But as that space becomes increasingly bolt out, we're continuing to look at opportunities there, and we think there's some stuff that's pretty interesting that we could add to the portfolio, and really work in an integrated way. I mean when you think about even LARSON, with Doors when we looked at LARSON, one of the most interesting things that popped out that screen doors to live life or air into their homes, it really was to create an access point to the outside. 
And so combining that with the leading exterior door business in the U.S. having a door system and could be a very interesting kind of indoor-outdoor living thing, which is certainly a trend that we're seeing. So that is an area. 
We do remain very focused on Plumbing opportunities. And they're not easy to come on, but there are things out there that are of interest. And particularly as our Plumbing Group continues to do such a phenomenal job of building out the adjacencies and the areas in which it competes, it opens the aperture of the types of things that we can add to the group, and to really move the business into kind of residential, water management and creating great experiences for consumers with [indiscernible]. So as you open that aperture, more opportunities can flow through. 
Connected Home is very interesting -- we have acquired flow, as you're well aware. And that is very, very exciting for us. It's being well received by builders, by insurers, by consumers. And there's a little question on mind that there's an inflection point in which that really becomes [indiscernible] that sort of digitize, all-home management of water becomes a standard in homes. 
When that [indiscernible] comes -- We're not that brilliant that we can call it, but you can see that really becoming something of so much value that it becomes undeniable. So what other spaces are there? What other adjacencies are there in the connected home, where, again, we could create value. Now you asked a little bit earlier about Fortune Brands, so it certainly helps as we go out and look at what's in the pipeline because we have both these skill sets out in category management, in global supply chain management, in business simplification essentially that we can look at other businesses and see how we can deploy those capabilities against those businesses to create value. And that becomes a very powerful tool in our quiver when we think about creating value for stakeholders. 
And so we're excited, again, the bar we hold high value, and we want to do things where we [indiscernible]"

I mean they came in well ahead of where we were for the second quarter in a row. And even understanding the investments there, you were about flat year-over-year. 
And so I guess 2 questions there. One is, can you talk to what's driving that outperformance in there, the sustainability of it? And the guide of 22-plus-percent for the year suggests a pretty decent deceleration sequentially, which I know that there's some inflationary pressures and those kinds of things coming through. But still, it feels like on a relative basis, it's a big move down. Can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that? And what the drivers there are?"

I think, first, the team there is doing a great job of managing its business to simultaneously drive growth and margin, but make the right investments. But you're right in observing the second quarter was particularly strong. Part of that was FX driven, in that, we had about $7.5-ish million of FX benefit to O-I, and that is almost all in Plumbing, with the strength of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. currency. 
They still have a very strong margin without that. And they've made double-digit brand investment up in the quarter year-over-year. But they're going to be also accelerating brand investment outside the back of the year -- back half of the year. And what happens in the back half of the year is the currency is neutralized. So you get the effect of the kind of the currency benefit phased away in the back half of the year and the investment goes in. And so therefore, you end up with a back half where they're planning out closer to their longer-term margin trajectory, which should be 22-plus percent."

And I think without a doubt, in big box retail, we've seen some deceleration as other channels have moved up. 
But we've got a pretty broad view over housing product when you look at the portfolio. And this is a question that we've tested deeply with our teams, and we're not seeing deceleration at all. In fact, we're still seeing inputs at a level in excess of capacity, and we're seeing backlogs that are growing. And our team is working unbelievably hard to try to meet customer needs to get product out the door. 
And we believe that's driven by these fundamentals, which remain to be true that people need housing. The market is fundamentally under booked, that there is not enough new construction and that there is an extremely aged housing stuff that is in dire need of renovation. And you add to that, that home equities are high. And people -- even if it's softened a little bit, which isn't actually a bad thing because we believe it allows for sustainability in the marketplace.  Houses continue to trade, which is a good catalyst. 
And so with those things in place, we do our checks across all of our portfolio, speak to our teams and our customers. We're seeing it continue to be very robust and believe that will continue to be robust as people need to renovate very aging housing stocks. So I think Pat, you'd add to that?"

Well, to a degree, capacity has been constrained less by sort of part assets, but certain labor constraints have been a real challenge. Transportation has been a real challenge.

Well, to a degree, capacity has been constrained less by sort of part assets, but certain labor constraints have been a real challenge. Transportation has been a real challenge. And that has just sort of capped, what I'd call shorter-term capacity. 
Now we have seen some labor start to flow back, particularly as unemployment benefits have lessened in certain states. And so we're very interested to see what happens in the fall when that starts to go away. And we've seen a little bit of easing up on logistics and transportation, although in another time. But those are shorter-term constraints that we do believe will ease up over time. 
On the longer term kind of capital journey as we look at capacity, there are areas where we're investing, I'd say, clearly, across the board. Obviously, in Cabinets, we just opened a new facility that's fully open now, but still ramping, and so that brings you more capacity online. And we'll continue to look as we fine-tune that business. But I will say that, that team is doing a phenomenal job getting more out of its existing footprint, and that's part of their margin journey as they simplify that business that actually frees up capacity inside of the existing footprint. And so I think we'll create more headroom there. 
Decking, we're at capacity. We've got more capacity online coming this back half of the year. We think that will be lapped up immediately. We're looking to accelerate a multiyear plan to see if we can bring some more in a little bit sooner and we'll continue to add there. And that product is such a value for consumer, whether it be at current lumber prices or lower lumber prices. You're comparing a product that is innovative, branded and really, sort of, consumer desired versus something that's a commodity that is going to run for a very long time. And so there will be capacity needs there. 
In Plumbing, we've invested in a new distribution center as well as in our global supply chain. That's going to give us some headroom. But with the kind of growth that we got, we continue to work very, very hard. And then -- so Doors is also kind of nearing kind of capacity, and we're going to look at incremental adds there. 
Pat can speak to it from a CapEx journey perspective, I would say it's fairly in line with historically, maybe a bit more investment. But from a headroom perspective, what I'd tell you is we look at capacity very seriously with the teams at every quarterly review and have a multiyear plan to add it. And so really, the constraints, I'd say now are more shorter term in nature, but we will have to add hard capacity over the next few years to meet the kind of demand that we're seeing now, and we expect to see into the future."

We're probably carrying in 3 points of inflation into next year that we were anticipating in our strat plan. But we're managing that now, and we'll manage that -- we'll manage that next year. 
I think in terms of our ability to hold pricing and/or drive margins, we're confident in our margin journey. And -- we will be mindful in managing prices as inflation, maybe changes on the downward as we were in managing it on the uptick. We were very thoughtful with our channel partners to keep our products competitive for them and to keep them competitive in the end markets for consumers. And so we'll use that same logic as we manage any dynamics next year that might be deflationary.

Current demand for our products remains robust, and our teams continue to drive accelerated share gains across the portfolio.
Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 15.4%, and earnings per share increased 66%. Headwinds from inflation and supply chain constraints were significant in the quarter, making these results even more remarkable. Across our company, we are diligently working to meet demand to keep our customers served with our industry-leading brands. On the back of a strong market and our accelerating outperformance, we are again increasing our full year 2021 sales and EPS guidance while maintaining our operating margin goal of around 15%. Pat will go into further detail on our increased guidance later in the call.  
While this quarter provided an easier comp given the COVID-related shutdowns in North America and Europe last year,  each segment also delivered sequential sales growth and operating margin improvement versus a strong first quarter of 2021. We now expect full year organic sales growth to be in the high teens as favorable demand trends persist. We continue to deliver on our strategic agenda, including accelerating our margin improvement and growth initiatives via our Fortune Brands advantaged capabilities while also investing for future growth to drive increasing stakeholder value.  
These outstanding results would not have been possible without our exceptional team of people who continue to make the difference; putting safety first, going above and beyond to serve our channel partners and customers, and operating with a culture of excellence. Thank you to all who work hard each day, standing proudly behind our world-class brands that make an increasingly positive impact on people's homes, safety and communities.  
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we are seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our second quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as thoughts around our increased guidance to our financial outlook for the year.  
Now, turning to our view on the housing market. The long-term fundamentals for U.S. housing and home products remain very favorable. The U.S. housing stock is underbuilt by millions of homes, and builders are currently pacing orders and managing backlogs to alleviate constraints on labor, commodities and affordability while completing communities under construction. Though demand remains extremely robust, this pacing will result in a further elongation of demand that will provide long-term momentum to many of our leading brands, which are the preferred choice for builders and the trade.  
Our strong positioning across all channels, including the wholesale and dealer channel, which service pros and builders, is differentiating us and gives us exposure to the additional torque from new construction growth. With lower inventory and builders phasing supply, homeowners are buying existing homes from a very aged housing stock requiring repair and remodel investment. We have seen the strengthening of larger ticket R&R as the channels historically serving that demand have more fully opened.  
Within the retail channel, there has been some market commentary regarding demand normalizing and consumer spending shifting to other categories as the economy opens further. While the retail channel may be showing some recent signs of normalization for certain product categories, demand is shifting back towards the trade channels that were largely closed at this time last year.  We are still expecting robust activity for the remainder of the year as reflected by our increased market and financial guidance. 
As we continue to make progress on our objectives, it is important not to lose sight of the long-term demographic tailwinds supporting this prolonged housing boom. The 2 largest segments of the population, millennials and baby boomers, both have significant need for housing and home products. Millennials, the largest segment of the population will be a great force for years to come in forming and upgrading households, accelerating the need for homebuilding and driving investment in new homes and R&R. This demographic is still in the early stages of fueling housing growth. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, with record equity in their homes and retirement accounts, and are upgrading and adjusting their homes for their next phase of life.  
Given the sheer size of these demographics and severity of the U.S. under-booked we expect these fundamentals to play out over many years to come. Our portfolio is excellently positioned from a product mix, price point and channel exposure standpoint to take advantage of the long-term secular trends in new construction and R&R. We intend to outperform this market, consistent with our long track record.  
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. As I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter. Our leading brands continue to resonate with consumers who are looking for world-class products driven by purpose and innovation. When consumers buy our products, they expect more than just functionality. They buy our brands because our brands are built with purpose. When they buy Moen,  they're buying a brand that continuously innovates to advance water efficiency and conservation. When they buy Fiberon decking, they are buying eco-friendly composite boards that are over 94% made from recycled materials. When they buy MasterBrand Cabinets, they're buying quality craftsmanship using responsibly sourced materials. Our Therma-Tru door systems are energy efficient, and our security products keep people and possessions safe.  
This sense of purpose and greater good for all resonates from our amazing employee base. Our recent ESG report has received accolades from investors, and I am very proud of the contributions our brands and people make to the environment and our communities. We are committed to doing even more in the future.  
Operationally, we continue to execute our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities that fund investment in key growth priorities including in our brand building and product innovation, digital initiatives and capacity and distribution expansion. Those capabilities are contributing to our outperformance in the first half of 2021 and will continue to accelerate in the years ahead.  
Inflation, whether it be from material, freight or labor, increased as we move through the second quarter. However,  as you can see from our strong performance, we are pulling every lever available to us to offset these headwinds and serve our customers. We prioritize our continuous improvement in supply chain programs to offset inflation, and then turn to price where necessary. We've been thoughtful about where and when we take price so as to maintain constructive customer relationships.  
As we have demonstrated over the past few years, our brands and products are desired by consumers and are capable of sustaining price increases while growing share. Our ability to mitigate and overcome challenges, whether demand, supply or inflationary in nature, has been proven through our consistent delivery of results.  
We will continue to be laser-focused on execution, driving stakeholder value across the organization no matter the environment. I mentioned it last quarter, and I will state it again: We are committed to offsetting inflationary and supply chain headwinds for the full year. With an even stronger 2021 outlook, we are accelerating investment behind our core strategies to continually deliver market-leading growth and margin expansion over the long run.  
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we're positioning for long-term growth, starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group continued to significantly outperform the global and U.S. markets this past quarter, taking share in every geographic region in which we operate. The business is firing on all cylinders, with sales growth of 38% -- or 33%, excluding FX. Our strong Plumbing sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 24.3% operating margin for the quarter, notwithstanding increased investment in brand, innovation and customer service.  
To put this margin performance into context, we delivered these results inclusive of increased brand investment of low double-digit millions over last year and significant expenditures related to improving our service levels to our customers. We achieved very strong double-digit sales growth across all brands, channels and regions. We are winning share and generating incremental investment dollars to pursue further above market growth and margin in both North America and in China.  
In North America, our Plumbing business has never been stronger. We continue to be an industry leader in both innovation and key metrics on brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty among customers. Our momentum in the smart home plumbing market, including continued adoption by builders, insurance companies and consumers of our Flo by Moen technology is driving further core growth, propelling the flywheel of top and bottom line performance.  
In China, Moen achieved double-digit growth on a very tough comp to Q2 last year as the Chinese market was reopening in this quarter a year ago. We continue to invest to position Moen as a leading brand with Chinese consumers and are increasing our total addressable market by expanding our product adjacencies. We are also making incremental investments in capacity and distribution.  
Finally, the House of ROHL sales nearly doubled globally and increased double digits sequentially in all regions. The brands achieved these results despite many showrooms remaining appointment-only. We're seeing a clear uptrend in premium and luxury demand, not only in Plumbing, but across our entire portfolio, signaling consumer demand is strengthening for big-ticket R&R.  
Turning to our Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by over 60% and operating margin was 14.7%. Organically, sales increased 26%. These exceptional results were driven by strong double-digit decking and security growth and double-digit growth in doors. Supply chain and labor availability continue to impact operations across multiple brands within this segment. Our teams are hard at work to offset these headwinds, which held us back from achieving full capacity production.  
Integration of LARSON continues to progress well, and the business is performing as we expected. As with our other operations, the LARSON team met the supply chain and select material availability constraints in the quarter head on. Our teams across Outdoors & Security are working together to advance integration while capturing planned synergies.  
Turning to decking. Fiberon grew nearly 30% for the second quarter versus a strong quarter a year ago, and we continue to operate in a sold-out environment. Incremental midyear capacity will be utilized quickly, and we continue to take price and accelerate capacity expansion plans.  Market share conversion from lumber to higher-performing eco-friendly composites continue to trend higher.  
Sales in Doors experienced double-digit growth in the quarter and would have been even better had operations not been constrained by labor and materials. As a leader in serving the new construction market, activity remained robust, as it had for much of the past year. Similar to our decking operations, we're currently in near sold-out conditions and are working to optimize our supply chains to meet this high level of demand.  
Turning to Security. Sales accelerated this past quarter, growing strong double digits versus a year ago and led by U.S. retail POS and the continued recovery of commercial and international markets. Our key North American retail market is back above 2019 levels, and we continue to leverage Fortune Brands advantage capabilities within Security to drive our momentum.  
Finally, turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets operations again delivered excellent performance in the past quarter, with sales growing 31% and operating margin of 10.9%. Even when compared to a very strong first quarter, the business achieved sales and operating margin growth. This now marks 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit above-market growth as the market leader. Demand was impressive in both value and make to order. Our current record backlog in Cabinets is a clear sign of the strong demand for our products.  
Our Advantage dealer network has continued to drive increasing sales and margin progression for much of the past year. Additionally, our new facility in Georgia is fully open and ramping up production to serve demand. Mantra continues to perform well and is demonstrating the competitiveness of our low-cost global supply chain.  
In addition to strong demand, both Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities and a culture of continuous improvement have driven Cabinets' performance. We are on track to continue margin progression this year and in the future as we progress towards our goal of mid-teens margins as the market leader in the industry.  
In summary, we continue to see very strong demand for our products driven by fundamentals and demographics. Our performance has been accelerated by the strength and culture of our company, brand building and consumer-led innovation, expertise in channel development and a relentless focus on people, execution and continuous improvement. The operating environment has been quite challenging in 2021, but it was also challenging a year ago. We have faced these challenges head on and have planned for future scenarios with our eyes wide open. While there may be other short-term obstacles and bumps in this long-term multiyear housing expansion, our team has proven its ability to overcome and emerge stronger Time and time again.  
In addition to outperforming operationally, we are also well positioned with a strong balance sheet to continue to pursue future growth, whether organically or inorganically. Our stakeholders can count on our experienced management team to continue to create value regardless of the environment. We expect to capture the upside of the long-term expansion in housing as we continue to build a great company for our stakeholders.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results and updated guidance. Pat?"

As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.94 billion, up 41% from a year ago.",1482,"Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results. 
Sales were $1.94 billion, up 41% from a year ago. Organic sales growth, excluding the LARSON acquisition, was up 32%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $298 million, up 51% or $101 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 15.4%, up 110 basis points over the same quarter last year. 
EPS were $1.56 for the quarter, up 66% versus $0.94 the same quarter last year. It is important to note that our associates' focus on safety and a culture of outperformance drove these outstanding results. 
Demand has remained strong across product categories, with growing strength in larger ticket and contractor-installed products. Headwinds from increasing material and freight inflation, as well as supply chain and labor inefficiencies are being addressed head on, as reflected in our results. We are taking additional actions during the second half, and our teams are working tirelessly to address these challenges. 
Our advantaged business model of leading brands and channel positions across a portfolio of products is providing synergistic benefits as we navigate this environment. We are executing above market, and our Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities enable us to deliver strong results for the company and our stakeholders. 
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $695 million, up $190 million or 38% -- or 33% adjusting for FX. Second quarter growth was up very strong double digits across all major brands, channels and geographies. 
Plumbing operating income increased 37% to $169 million for the second quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.3%, despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to service our customers. We expect 2021 margins to be above 22% for the full year. 
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the second quarter were $536 million, up $203 million or 61%, driven by the addition of LARSON as well as strong double-digit growth in security and decking and continued double-digit growth in Doors. On an organic basis, sales were up 26%. 
Doors sales were up double digits in the quarter, driven by consistently strong retail POS and an accelerating new construction market. Reported sales results would have been even stronger within the quarter, if not for labor and material constraints, the latter, a fading impact of the Texas storms. 
Decking sales were up strong double digits in the quarter as our distribution gains in wholesale continued to drive results. Demand continues to exceed production capacity and we are selling every board we can make. We expect this will continue as additional capacity comes online in the fourth quarter, and we are accelerating future capacity expansion plans. 
Security sales significantly rebounded with over 40% growth in the quarter, with continued strength in retail and a welcome pickup in the commercial market. 
Outdoors & Security operating income was $79 million during the quarter, up 64% over the same quarter last year driven by the addition of LARSON and operating improvements in decking and security. Segment operating margin increased 30 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 14.7%. 
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the second quarter were $706 million, an increase of 31% over the same quarter in 2020. We again saw strong growth of value-priced products and sales of higher-priced, make-to-order products accelerated in the quarter. This positive signal for big-ticket R&R reflects consumers' increased desire and ability to invest in their homes. 
Operating income in the second quarter was $77 million, up 74% or $33 million versus the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.9%, up 270 basis points versus the same period a year ago. 
Before turning to the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance, I would like to address the topic of increasing inflation as well as inefficiencies in supply chain and labor markets as we continue to execute in this period of long-term sustainable housing growth. While inflation headwinds were anticipated, they continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking incremental actions during the second half of the year to offset increased inflation. We always first challenge ourselves to drive enhanced cost savings. Then when necessary, we utilize price. 
As inflation has intensified, we remain thoughtful regarding price increases. We seek to keep our channel partners and products competitive, and to minimize disruption if and when off-cycle pricing becomes necessary. That said, our brands and products continue to demonstrate their ability to drive share gains while commanding additional price. 
Through this combination of cost and thoughtful pricing actions, we plan to offset all inflationary headwinds this year and expect to deliver 2021 operating margin improvement. We remain on our '21 and long-term margin improvement trajectory. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash of $460 million, net debt of $2.1 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now at 1.7x. We ended the second quarter with approximately $430 million of available capacity on our revolver. We are in a strong financial position to continue to deploy capital to benefit our company and stakeholders. 
We have made and will continue to make significant investment both in our core Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities as well as into our brands through continued innovation, production capacity and distribution enhancements. We also recently announced an additional authorization to repurchase common stock. The new 2-year authorization allows for the purchase of up to an incremental 400 million of common stock. We have purchased approximately 156 million through the first half of the year. And as always, we'll be strategic and opportunistic when purchasing shares. We remain focused on deploying capital effectively to accelerate stakeholder value creation. 
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Given our continued outperformance and a strong home products market, we are raising our market and financial outlook for the year of 2021. Based on the expectation that the global market for our products will now grow 10% to 12%, with the U.S. housing market growing 11% to 13%. And within this market forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 14%, and U.S. R&R growth of 11% to 13%. Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth is expected to be 23% to 25%, or 16% to 18% on an organic basis. 
Our full year operating margin is expected to remain around 15%. We expect second half operating margin to average around 15%, similar to the 15.1% achieved during the first half. The third quarter is expected to experience modest margin compression, while fourth quarter margin is expected to expand as midyear actions reflect more fully in our income statement. We continue to target meaningful margin progress during '21 and are tracking to our long-term margin objectives, demonstrating our ability to accelerate value creation regardless of the environment. 
We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.65 to $5.85 on a before charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth of 37% over our record 2020. Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our updated guidance includes: Plumbing net sales growth of 21% to 23%, with operating margins above 22%; Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 44% to 48%, or 14% to 16% excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 15% to 16%, or approximately 16% to 17% adjusting for purchase accounting; Cabinets net sales growth of 13% to 15%, with operating margins approaching 12%. 
We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $675 million to $725 million, which includes additional investments in capacity to accelerate growth. We anticipate a cash conversion rate of 80% to 90%. 
The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $104 million to $106 million; interest expense of approximately $83 million to $86 million; a tax rate of between 23% and 24%, with a second half tax rate more in line with our longer-term rate of around 25%; and average fully diluted shares of approximately $140 million to $141 million. Our increased forecast represents the outperformance of our business in a strong market, including continued share gains and positive operating leverage. In addition, our relentless focus on internal improvement and driving synergies across our portfolio will enable us to extend our continued best-in-class track record. 
Our fortress balance sheet will continue to allow us to pursue internal and external growth, and we are actively assessing opportunities to do so. We expect to outperform a long-term housing expansion and cannot be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
I will now pass the call back to Dave to conclude our prepared remarks."

I was hoping to get a sense of -- you mentioned that you're pursuing some incremental action to offset the incremental inflation in the back half. I was hoping -- and you always kind of talked about balancing cost savings with price increases. I was hoping maybe to get a sense of when you think about the incremental headwind that you're seeing in the back half, how much are you expecting to offset through cost versus price? 
And also perhaps more broadly, if you could talk about perhaps on the cost side and operational excellence productivity, how some of the Fortune Brands Advantage programs and initiatives are contributing to that ability to offset."

This is Nick, I'll start and give you some thoughts conceptually, and Pat can fill in some of the detail.

This is Nick, I'll start and give you some thoughts conceptually, and Pat can fill in some of the detail. 
But as you all know, and as you've noted, I mean, the business continues to perform and demonstrate its resilience notwithstanding the environment. And so we're seeing a really strong market, and we're seeing some very large inflationary pressures as well as just supply chain disruption that continues -- that's been widely reported. 
And yes, if you step back for a second ago, well, how does the business continue to perform? A lot of this stems from the fact that we are on a margin improvement journey, and we're doing it very programmatically and very deliberately, and we're leveraging it across the whole business. And so I think if you were to take us -- we were just ecstatic. We were just trying to hold the line. And then you might see buffering from outside forces. But since the business is so geared towards a continuous improvement mindset and taking these Fortune Brands Advantages and deploying them throughout the business, we're able to see those benefits come through even in a challenging environment. 
And so if I take -- Fortune Brands Advantage, for example, you have 3 big products: business simplification, you've got category management and you've got global sourcing, right? And 2 of those, business simplification and global sourcing, really do drive, I'd say, both business resilience and cost improvement. 
And so coming into the year, we had significant plans to take those and leverage them throughout the business in different places, in different pockets. And it goes down to desire. As I said before, I mean, this is backed by investments we've made in building the capabilities, in building the teams. So for example, just this year, we hired a Fortune Brands center of excellence in global sourcing, drove a material number of people that we're continuing to build out that team. 
And so by doing that, we had the business on a trajectory where we're able to drive cost improvement, as well as improve the quality of the supply chain, even taking complexity out. And what you find is that suppliers that are able to work with us to meet the sort of input costs that we're looking for, actually tend to be the better suppliers. And so where we put these programs in place, we actually found the business is actually more resilient at lower cost versus less resilient. 
And so that is a big underpinning of the progress that we've been able to make. And then, of course, if that doesn't cover everything, as we've said, we do look to take price. Now we try not to do it outside of our regular cadence. We certainly had to this year. I think what price has spoken to is the strength of the brand and the strength of our channel management, because despite the fact that we've taken price, we continue to gain share, which is telling you that the value equation still sits very much in favor of the consumer. 
We're innovating. We're adding a lot of value to our products. We're building brands. And so we're able to take price to where we have looked the prices gone in, and I'm sure you guys are doing your channel checks and you're seeing that, and it's being well received. We're just trying to do it in a way that's as constructive as possible, notwithstanding the headwinds that we're facing. 
So it's that really programmatic approach. And I think the fact that we've taken a more programmatic approach is really paying off now. What I'll tell you that's particularly exciting about it is from my perspective, we're just getting started. I mean these are investments that we've made over the last couple of years. We're just building out these teams, and we're just getting rolling, and that momentum will build over time. And so we expect this to continue to deliver for the business for a very long time to come. Pat, do you have anything?"
33174798,1673288843,2353476,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Mike, hearing your question, trying to get to the numbers of it all, when we talked at the end of the last quarter, we talked about commodity, freight and tariff inflation in the range of 4% to 5% of COGs. We're probably in the range of 6-plus percen",374,"Yes. Mike, hearing your question, trying to get to the numbers of it all, when we talked at the end of the last quarter, we talked about commodity, freight and tariff inflation in the range of 4% to 5% of COGs. We're probably in the range of 6-plus percent of COGs. So you're starting to talk a dollar amount that's approaching $250 million, working on with all components. Tariffs are a pretty minor part of that, they're pretty static year-over-year. But both freight and commodity is a big chunk of that. We don't break down what chunk is cost versus what chunk is priced. They're both contributing very significantly to us offsetting that. And we totally -- we plan to totally offset that this year. 
And I'd kind of point us to the margin journey we're on. As Nick said, we're pointing still towards 16% to 17% margin by 2023, which is 7-basis-plus points a year, plus of margin improvement, and we're tracking that this year. This year, we'll use cost and price on the variable side to get after the variable inflation, and we'll lever the structural cost savings we made the last couple of years, especially in Cabinets and a few other of our businesses, and continue to make, in our businesses and volume to lever towards the margin improvement this year. They'll both be driving the margin improvement this year. 
And what I'd say is we're 8 quarters in a row of year-over-year quarterly margin improvement. And we expect to keep margin on that, though the third quarter will present some challenges.  This year, of that 6% margin inflation, about 70% of it will hit during the second half, with a disproportionate chunk in the third quarter. And so the back half will be about a 15-ish percent margin to complement the front half, to deliver somewhere around that for the full year. But we'll probably be 30 to 60 basis points down in operating margin for the third quarter, but then probably 30 to 60 basis points of margin up in the fourth quarter to deliver a back half that's right around 15%. And go into next year solidly on the ground to keep making progress towards our longer-term goal."

I guess maybe taking a step back strategically, you mentioned in terms of your free cash flow deployment. As always, you evaluate a combination of share repurchase and bolt-on M&A. Obviously, in the last couple -- 3, 4 years, you've really bolstered the Outdoor & Security segment. That follows before that, kind of building out or rounding out a little bit on the Plumbing side. How should we think about the opportunity set over the next 2 or 3 or 4 years across your different segments or portfolios? It seems like Cabinets has certainly been on the quieter side. I think the last major one was Norcraft, way back when. Plumbing, you've obviously made some very nice add-ons with the House of ROHL now rolled up into that. 
Just curious if there's anything left perhaps to think about or expect on the Plumbing side. Or is it really more just building out opportunistically the outdoor portfolio? And specifically on the Outdoor, I'm particularly curious if there's any product categories that perhaps we should be thinking about?"

I'm happy to give you some perspectives. And I'd like to point out, we're well aware of the strong cash generation and [indiscernible] very thoughtful about ways in which we can continue to create value to our stakeholders here. And our priorities",695,"Sure. I'm happy to give you some perspectives. And I'd like to point out, we're well aware of the strong cash generation and [indiscernible] very thoughtful about ways in which we can continue to create value to our stakeholders here. 
And our priorities remain the same. I mean, first and foremost, we look to our own business and CapEx opportunities to grow and drive the strategic priorities. And I think at this level of growth, we see opportunities there to continue to invest behind it, which are pretty exciting. And when we look to M&A, and then where we don't find good M&A opportunities, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
On M&A, I'll say the pipeline is robust. And it's as robust as I've seen in a very long time, if not ever. And so there's a lot of stuff out there. We're going to remain disciplined and look for places where we can fit. That's the bar we hold very high.
The areas that are of interest remain the same. Certainly, outdoors & Security. We're very excited about opportunities in the outdoor space. Our focus on that where things that you historically think of in terms of Fortune Brands, where we believe we can take a brand where there can be structural advantage, where we can leverage our channel know-how, are the areas in which we'll focus. There are other areas in Outdoor that we've looked at, we've decided, are more commoditized and are not worth pursuing. 
But as that space becomes increasingly built out, we're continuing to look at opportunities there, and we think there's some stuff that's pretty interesting that we could add to the portfolio and really work in an integrated way. I mean when you think about even LARSON, with Doors, when we looked at LARSON, one of the most interesting things that popped out was that screen door to let life or air into their homes. It really was to create an access point to the outside. And so combining that with the leading exterior door business in the U.S. while having a door system could be a very interesting kind of indoor-outdoor living thing, which is certainly a trend that we're seeing. So that is an area. 
We do remain very focused on Plumbing opportunities. And they're not easy to come by, but there are things out there that are of interest. And particularly, as our Plumbing group continues to do such a phenomenal job of building out the adjacencies and the areas in which it competes, it opens the aperture of the types of things that we can add to the group, and to really move the business into kind of residential, water management and creating great experiences for consumers with water. So as you open that aperture, more opportunities can flow through. 
Connected Home is very interesting. We have acquired Flo, as you're well aware. And that is very, very exciting for us. It's being well received by builders, by insurers, by consumers. And there's a little question on mind that there's an inflection point in which that really becomes integral, that sort of digitized, all-home management of water becomes the standard in homes. When that [ point ] comes -- we're not that brilliant that we can call it, but you can see that really becoming something of so much value that it becomes undeniable. So what other spaces are there? What other adjacencies are there in the Connected Home, where again, we could create value. 
Now you asked a little bit earlier about Fortune Brands Advantage, so it certainly helps as we go out and look at what's in the pipeline because we have both these skill sets out in category management, in global supply chain management, in business simplification, essentially, that we can look at other businesses and see how we can deploy those capabilities against those businesses to create value. And that becomes a very powerful tool in our quiver when we think about creating value for stakeholders. 
And so we're excited, again, the bar we hold high [indiscernible] value, and we want to do things where we can [indiscernible]."

I mean they came in well ahead of where we were for the second quarter in a row. And even understanding the investments there, you were about flat year-over-year. 
And so I guess 2 questions there. One is, can you talk to what's driving that outperformance in there, the sustainability of it? And the guide of 22-plus-percent for the year suggests a pretty decent deceleration sequentially, which I know that there's some inflationary pressures and those kinds of things coming through. But still, it feels like on a relative basis, it's a big move down. Can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that? And what the drivers there are?"

I think, first, the team there is doing a great job of managing its business to simultaneously drive growth and margin, but make the right investments. But you're right in observing the second quarter was particularly strong. Part of that was FX-driven. In that, we had about $7.5-ish million of FX benefit to OI, and that is almost all in Plumbing, with the strength of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. currency. 
They still have a very strong margin without that. And they've made double-digit brand investment up in the quarter year-over-year. But they're going to be also accelerating brand investment outside the back of the year -- back half of the year. And what happens in the back half of the year is the currency is neutralized. So you get the effect of the kind of the currency benefit phased away in the back half of the year and the investment goes in. And so therefore, you end up with a back half where they're planning out closer to their longer-term margin trajectory, which should be 22-plus percent."

And I think without a doubt, in big box retail, we've seen some deceleration as other channels have moved up. 
But we've got a pretty broad view over housing product when you look at the portfolio. And this is a question that we've tested deeply with our teams, and we're not seeing deceleration at all. In fact, we're still seeing inputs at a level in excess of capacity, and we're seeing backlogs that are growing. And our team is working unbelievably hard to try to meet customer needs to get product out the door. 
And we believe that's driven by these fundamentals, which remain to be true that people need housing. The market is fundamentally under-booked, that there is not enough new construction and that there is an extremely aged housing stock that is in dire need of renovation. And you add to that, home equities are high and people -- even if it's softened a little bit, which isn't actually a bad thing because we believe it allows for sustainability in the marketplace, houses continue to trade, which is a good catalyst. 
And so with those things in place, we do our checks across all of our portfolio, speak to our teams and our customers. We're seeing it continue to be very robust and believe that will continue to be robust as people need to renovate very aged housing stocks. So anything you'd add to that?"

Well, to a degree, capacity has been constrained less by sort of hard assets, but certain labor constraints have been a real challenge, transportation has been a real challenge. And that has just sort of capped, what I'd call shorter-term capacity. 
Now we have seen some labor start to flow back, particularly as unemployment benefits have lessened in certain states. And so we're very interested to see what happens in the fall when that starts to go away. And we've seen a little bit of easing up on logistics and transportation, although in another time in. But those are shorter-term constraints that we do believe will ease up over time. 
On the longer term kind of capital journey as we look at capacity, there are areas where we're investing, I'd say, fairly, across the board. Obviously, in Cabinets, we just opened a new facility that's fully open now, but still ramping, and so that brings on more capacity online. And we'll continue to look as we fine-tune that business. But I will say that, that team is doing a phenomenal job getting more out of its existing footprint, and that's part of their margin journey. As they simplify that business, it actually frees up capacity inside of the existing footprint. And so I think will create more headroom there. 
Decking, we're at capacity. We've got more capacity online coming this back half of the year. We think that will be lapped up immediately. We're looking to accelerate a multiyear plan to see if we can bring some more in a little bit sooner and we'll continue to add there. And that product is such a value for consumer, whether it be at current lumber prices or lower lumber prices, you're comparing a product that is innovative, branded, and really consumer-desired versus something that's a commodity, that is going to run for a very long time. And so there will be capacity needs there. 
In Plumbing, we've invested in a new distribution center as well as in our global supply chain. That's going to give us some headroom. But with the kind of growth that we got, we continue to work very, very hard. 
And then -- so Doors is also kind of nearing kind of capacity. We're going to look at incremental adds there. 
Pat can speak to it from a CapEx journey perspective. I would say it's fairly in line with historically, maybe a bit more investment. But from a headroom perspective, what I'd tell you is we look at capacity very seriously with the teams at every quarterly review, and have a multiyear plan to add it. And so really, the constraints, I'd say now are more shorter term in nature, but we will have to add hard capacity over the next few years to meet the kind of demand that we're seeing now, and we expect to see into the future."

We're probably carrying in 3 points of inflation into next year that we weren't anticipating in our strat plan, but we're managing that now, and we'll manage that -- we'll manage that next year. 
I think in terms of our ability to hold pricing and/or drive margins, we're confident in our margin journey. And we will be mindful in managing prices as inflation maybe changes on the downward, as we were in managing it on the uptick. We were very thoughtful with our channel partners to keep our products competitive for them and to keep them competitive in the end markets for consumers. And so we'll use that same logic as we manage any dynamics next year that might be deflationary.

Our teams once again rose to the occasion, deliver an exceptional quarter, driving outperformance while facing tremendous supply chain headwinds, including challenges in labor, freight and material availability. 
Demand for our products remains very strong, and we are working tirelessly to serve our customers while combating the global supply chain challenges facing most industries. The perseverance shown by our team members across our world-class brands has been nothing short of remarkable. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we can deliver even in the face of significant challenges. We remain firmly on track for a record year with exceptional growth and margin improvement and to reach the long-term goals for Fortune Brands that were communicated earlier this year.
For the third quarter, company sales increased 20% in total and 14% organically, with all segments driving strong growth. This past quarter marked an all-time record in quarterly sales as we neared $2 billion. Operating income increased 20% and earnings per share increased 25%. Incredible results especially given the current external environment.
Demand for our products in the quarter was and remains robust, and we expect growth to persist as consumers continue to invest in housing. Our leading brands are well positioned to capitalize on these tailwinds, and our teams continue to drive share gains across the portfolio. Our mid-teens organic sales growth was complemented by LARSON, which is exceeding our expectations in terms of both performance and synergies.
I am proud of our team's ability to increase asset and drive performance, notwithstanding the challenging supply chain environment. Headwinds from supply chain, particularly in labor availability and freight and materials inflation, increased both during the quarter and relative to previous expectations. We are addressing these challenges by leveraging our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities and through incremental price. Across the company, we are diligently working to meet continued strong demand while keeping our customers served and employees safe.
As global supply chain, labor and other inflationary pressures all remain dynamic, we've updated our 2021 financial guidance as was highlighted in our earnings press release earlier today. Pat will provide additional detail later in the call.
Importantly, we remain on track to achieve exceptional growth and margin improvement in 2021 as well as towards our long-term targets communicated earlier this year. Notwithstanding these external challenges, we continue to increase investment to drive the long-term growth and margin progression of the company. In the quarter, we furthered our strategic agenda and made more than $30 million of incremental investments behind our digital journey, brand, innovation and Fortune Brands' advantage capabilities, while also delivering an operating margin on par with prior year. These investments were made in addition to the incremental investments made throughout last year. 
For the full year, we expect to make operating margin progress of around 50 basis points versus a year ago while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to drive long-term stakeholder value creation. Our strategies are delivering in this environment, and those incremental investments should only accelerate our performance when the current pace of challenges moderates.
The company continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, and our balance sheet is strong. We're committed to efficient and effective capital deployment by investing in strategic capital projects, executing disciplined M&A transactions and returning dollars to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our leverage remains very healthy, and we have plenty of capacity to deploy additional capital for more value creation activity.
We recently chose to accelerate capacity investments in Moen, in the House of Rohl, Therma-Tru and Fiberon brands and expect excellent returns from these initiatives. Additionally, we repurchased $114 million of shares in the third quarter, and our year-to-date share repurchase total currently stands at over $380 million.
As the company celebrated its 10-year anniversary of its spin-off and public listing in early October, cumulative capital returned to shareholders through repurchases alone surpassed $2.5 billion. Importantly, throughout our 10 years, we have also worked to serve all of our stakeholders from developing sustainable, innovative products and processes, to our best-in-class safety records, to our commitments to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG has long been a part of our culture.
This past quarter, we made some exciting advancements in our ESG journey and unveiled a new website with an enhanced focus on ESG. We continue to receive recognition for our best-in-class safety record, including multiple awards for the work we do, keeping our employees safe. In honor of our 10-year anniversary, we announced meaningful partnerships with 2 outstanding affordable housing organizations. I can't think of a better way to celebrate our milestone anniversary and to make this commitment to help make the dreams of home more attainable for many families in our communities. While there is more work to be done, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished.
Over the past decade, we have proven our ability to execute in any environment and to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value creation. This is possible because of the team of exceptional people across our organization who continue to make a difference, putting safety first, going above and beyond to serve our channel partners and customers in operating with a commitment to excellence. They are the flag carriers of our culture, which drive our resiliency and results. Thank you to all who work start each day, standing proudly behind our world-class brands that make an increasingly positive impact on people's homes, safety and communities.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our third quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as thoughts around our updated guidance to our financial outlook for the full year.
Now turning to our view on the housing market. Long-term fundamentals for housing and home products remained very favorable. The significant deficit of homes available for sale and the structural underbuilding that is contributing to the current housing situation has been elongated by increasing labor, supply chain and material availability headwinds. While these challenges have made global headlines and will take time to normalize, it will take much longer, years, in fact, to work through the significant undersupply of up-to-date homes relative to demand.
We saw some moderation in the pace of home sales versus Q3 of 2020. We view this moderation as a net positive, as it allows for a more sustainable long-term expansion of housing products while still driving very strong demand. Notwithstanding the moderation, demand for our products continue to persist ahead of supply. We also experienced some rebalancing of demand across channels. And between the rebalancing and the very strong but moderating home purchasing market, we believe the overall marketplace is on an even healthier footing for long-term sustainable growth than it was this time last year.
Within both the new construction and repair and remodel markets, we continue to see consumers focusing investment on the home. Demand for larger ticket and pro-oriented projects remains elevated, which squarely aligns with much of our product portfolio. These product categories are sold mostly through the trade, wholesale and builder channels, and have experienced strong, sustained momentum since before the pandemic. With our excellent relationships and preferred positioning in those channels, coupled with market leadership for our premium brands, we expect this momentum to continue and demand for our products to remain robust.
We also saw consumers continue to spend up the price spectrum into premium offerings. We have seen this multi-quarter trend in both plumbing and cabinets. And I'll also seeing this trend play out within our premium offerings in decking and doors. This sign of continued consumer confidence to invest in the home reflects both the health of the consumer and household balance sheets as well as consumers' growing aspirations for what the home can become. 
Whether it be a new construction or repair and remodel markets, we believe we are optimally positioned to capture accelerated share leveraged by the best home products portfolio in the U.S. and have leadership positions in all of our brands. Driven by an advantaged set of channel positions, significant growth capital to deploy, and supported by our world-class people, we could not be more excited about the future.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. We had a stellar quarter even in the face of incremental supply chain headwinds. Demand was robust through the quarter and remains strong today across the whole portfolio. Our teams are working tirelessly to offset the numerous supply chain and labor constraints, and we're taking incremental actions to deliver both near-term results and long-term growth and margin objectives.
Cumulatively, labor shortages and freight constraints were our most acute pressure points across the portfolio and are more challenging than even 90 days ago. We are responding with stronger measures in human capital attraction and retention strategies. At the same time, we're also leveraging our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities to reduce complexity and minimize dependence on labor. We're also utilizing our scale and capabilities in global sourcing and logistics to optimize freight efficiency.
We're further developing and deploying our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities and our funding strategic investments in key growth priorities, including in our digital journey, brand building and product innovation as well as in capacity and distribution expansion. These investments are contributing to our resiliency and as conditions normalize, we expect to continue to increase sales and margin, allowing for stronger capital deployment and investment which will drive our perpetual outperformance engine for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we're positioning for long-term growth, starting with Plumbing. Our Global Funding Group once again significantly outperformed the global and U.S. markets this past quarter, taking share in every geographic region in which we operate. The business continues to fire on all cylinders with sales growth of 6% or 23% excluding FX. Our strong Plumbing sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 22.6% operating margin for the quarter, notwithstanding increased investment in brand, innovation and improved customer service.
Our North American wholesale and e-commerce channels delivered strong double-digit growth, and we continue to grow in retail despite very elevated comps from the prior year. We are winning share and generating incremental investment dollars to pursue further above-market growth and margin.
In North America, our plumbing business has never been stronger. We continue to be an industry leader in both innovation and key metrics on brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty among customers. Moen continues to lead in innovation and design and push new on-trend styles and functionality, including the recently launched Nebia by Moen's Quattro product line. This cutting-edge shower gives consumers the power to customize their experience while incorporating the Nebia by Moen's proprietary water saving technology, delivering on our water saving initiatives and ESG strategy.
As our business grows, we are also investing in incremental capacity across the supply chain, including a new distribution center opening this quarter. In China, Moen achieved strong double-digit growth, as our investments behind the Moen brand, category expansion and innovation continued to resonate with the Chinese consumer.
Given our broad product offering, diverse channel exposure and increasingly relevant consumer brand, we see continued growth in China despite headwinds from a slowing new construction market.
As we've demonstrated in the past, our sales growth is driven by our innovation and category expansion efforts and is not tied tightly to the overall market. Additionally, we've built a resilient China business with a cost structure that could flex to preserve margin delivery. While we anticipate that there may be interim slowing of that marketplace, we are well equipped to outperform as we did during the last slowdown in 2017.
Finally, the House of Rohl sales grew very strong double digits in all regions. Momentum in the luxury category has remained robust, and we expect demand to continue as consumers' willingness to invest and spend into larger ticket R&R remains significant. To keep up with this demand, we recently approved an investment to modernize and add capacity to our House of Rohl manufacturing facilities. 
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by 30% and operating margin was 15.6%. Organically, sales increased 6% and were impacted by the very elevated comps due to the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 last year in doors and decking as our channels reopened following COVID shutdowns. Material and labor availability headwinds increased through the third quarter, and continue to impact operations across all brands, including material shortages caused by Hurricane Ida. Our teams are hard at work to offset these challenges, which have restrained us from achieving targeted output. 
Doors delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting constraints in labor and materials and very elevated comps due to the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 last year, as our channels reopened more fully after COVID shutdowns. Adjusting for the shift, sales increased mid-teens. Production interruptions are key component suppliers caused by Hurricane Ida affected supply in the quarter, though we worked diligently across our supply chain to resolve these challenges going forward. Underlying demand remains strong across channels, and we continue to work to service our customers at a high level.
Turning to Decking. Fiberon sales grew mid-single digits off of a very strong quarter last year that also included the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 due to channel reopening. Adjusting for 2020 shipment cadence, sales increased around 20%. Our strategy of leveraging our deep customer relationships to partner with the leading distributors in each region continues to pay dividends as we remain in a sold-out position. We will be bringing incremental capacity online before year-end, and we expect fourth quarter sales growth to eclipse 25%. 
We continue to leverage Fortune Brands' advantage capabilities and other internal synergies to increase output and streamline costs. Our eco-friendly composite decking continues to resonate with consumers and remains in high demand as we take additional share from traditional wood decking.
As I mentioned earlier, integration of LARSON continues to progress well, and the business is performing above expectations. Our teams across outdoors and security are working together to advance integration while capturing planned synergies. 
Finally, within Security, we experienced continued success and momentum with high single-digit sales growth in the quarter as commercial, back-to-school and travel markets continue to rebound. Our key North American retail market for both locks and safes continued at levels stronger than prior to the start of the pandemic. The business is delivering on the Fortune Brands' advantage investments made over the last couple of years and is now generating incremental fuel for reinvestment.
Now turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets operations again delivered strong performance in the past quarter, with sales growing over 9% and operating margin of 9.7%. In an extremely tough environment, sales grew sequentially off of the strong Q2 and margins performed at industry-leading levels. Demand was equally strong on both stock and make to order, with the strongest momentum continuing in our premium offerings.
While labor challenges, material and freight inflation increased further, all are manageable and we continue to take price and deploy continuous improvement initiatives to offset these headwinds. Cabinets' margin performance in such a challenging and fast-evolving environment is a testament to how well our pivot plan and Fortune Brands advantage capabilities are delivery. As the pace of challenges moderates, and our pricing actions take further hold, the business will accelerate its progress towards its long-term margin objective.
Labor shortages and freight availability remain the biggest challenges impacting performance in margins in our Cabinets business. Our teams are deploying lean methodoligies and complexity reduction strategies to ease the supply chain and labor limitations. Significant order backlog exists across the business and what we worked through into 2022. We remain committed to our long-term margin goals for Cabinets, and the business simplification progress that we made this year within our facilities will prove beneficial as we continue to solve our labor challenges and price realization catches up during the fourth quarter and into early 2022.
In summary, we continue to see very strong demand for our products and believe the housing cycle is being further elongated by current short-term acute headwinds. We're very focused on overcoming challenges and delivering in the short term. and we have built this company and its strong culture to win for the long term. Our commitment to excellence, each other and our brands, leveraged by innovation, investment and most importantly, purpose drives everything that we do. Our products positively impact people's lives every day, and we do not take that for granted. We are committed to growing stronger together and will do so in a sustainable way.
As we near the end of 2021 and look to 2022 and beyond, the actions that we are taking now and the investments that we are making and expect to make in the future should drive above-market growth and a stronger margin profile. We have a strong balance sheet and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital over the next few years. We're excited about the housing market and for the future of our company. We will remain steadfast in our mandate to create value, regardless of the environment.
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results and updated guidance. Pat?"
33174798,1684382814,2413163,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Additionally, all comparisons will be made against the same quarter last year, unless otherwi",1409,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Additionally, all comparisons will be made against the same quarter last year, unless otherwise noted.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.99 billion, up 20%. Organic sales excluding the LARSON acquisition, were up 14%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $293 million, up 20% or $49 million. And total company operating margin was 14.8%, in line with the prior year period. EPS were $1.49 for the quarter, up 25%. These results reflect our team's tremendous performance in a highly disruptive environment, a testament to our culture of safety and outperformance across the organization.
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the third quarter were $741 million, up $151 million or 26% or up 23% adjusting for FX. Our Plumbing business continues to gain share and drive growth across all major brands, channels and geographies. Plumbing operating income increased 36% to $168 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.6% despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to serve our customers.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the third quarter were $528 million, up $122 million or 30%, driven by the addition of LARSON and mid-single-digit organic growth. On an organic basis, sales were up 6% against an elevated comp from the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter last year in doors and decking, as our wholesale channels reopened following the COVID shutdowns these channels experienced.
Door sales were up mid-single digits in the third quarter, driven by wholesale and would have been up mid-teens adjusting for the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter in 2020. Reported results would have been even stronger within the quarter were not for labor and material constraints, the latter the result of Hurricane Ida.
Decking sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter as Fiberon continued to sell out. Sales were up around 20% adjusting for the shift in sales from Q2 to Q3 last year. We expect incremental capacity to come online in the fourth quarter and are also increasing throughput by deploying process improvement. We expect fourth quarter decking sales growth to exceed 25%. 
Security sales continue to trend nicely with high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by returning strength in commercial, back-to-school and travel markets. Outdoor & Security operating income was $82 million during the quarter, up 24% and driven by the addition of LARSON and operating improvements in decking and security. Segment operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by inefficiencies caused by labor and material constraints in the quarter impacting doors and decking.
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the third quarter were $717 million, an increase of over 9% over the same quarter in 2020. We, again, saw strong demand across all price points during the quarter. Backlogs and lead times have extended during the quarter, and demand for contractor-led projects such as cabinets, remains very healthy.
Operating income in the third quarter was $69 million, down 13% or $11 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.7%, down 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago as price increase realization trailed inflation and labor and material availability resulted in inefficiencies. We expect this relationship to improve significantly during the fourth quarter.
By the first quarter of 2022, we expect continuous improvement and pricing actions to offset inflation fully and our rate of margin enhancement in cabinets to reaccelerate to our targeted objective. We remain well positioned to win in North America versus domestic competitors and imports. We expect to win increasing share and achieve our long-term margin objectives.
Before turning to the balance sheet and updated financial guidance, some thoughts on demand, supply and the current environment. Demand continues to be strong across the portfolio. Increasing headwinds from labor, freight availability and certain supply-constrained materials are being addressed. We are and expect to stay nimble as the situation warrants. We have made significant investments to serve continued strong demand and to increase service levels. We are also making further progress in deployment of our Fortune Brands advantage capabilities to leverage synergies across the portfolio in sourcing and other improvement initiatives.
We are keenly focused on the current dynamic environment, contributing towards rising COGS and freight inflation. The decisive actions we are taking will allow us to offset fully these headwinds, maintain our long-term margin trajectory and will put us in an advantaged position for 2022. 
Through a combination of continuous improvement and thoughtful pricing actions, we plan to offset all inflationary headwinds during the first quarter of 2022 and to continue to target around 75-plus basis points of margin improvement during 2022.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $461 million, net debt of $2.2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now 1.7x. We ended the third quarter with approximately $410 million of available capacity on our revolver. We are advantageously positioned to deploy capital to the highest returning opportunities.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased over $380 million of shares and have repurchased over $2.5 billion in common stock in 10 years as a public company. Our investment-grade balance sheet and strong free cash flow provide fuel for continued investment into our businesses, propelling the flywheel of outperformance on the top line and accelerating common capability building and deployment across our portfolio to achieve higher margins.
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Demand for our products remain strong in a sound housing market. However, increasing headwinds from labor shortages, supply chain challenges and inflation have adjusted our expectations for full year 2021, based on the expectation that the global market for our products will now grow 11% to 12%, with the U.S. housing market growing 12% to 13%. And within this forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 13% to 14%.  Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth outlook is expected to be 24.5% to 25.5% or 17.5% to 18.5% on an organic basis.
We continue to target  meaningful margin progress and expect to deliver around 50 basis points of margin improvement during 2021, despite inflation that is almost 3x what we expected at the beginning of this year. We are tracking to our longer-term margin objectives, demonstrating our ability to accelerate value creation regardless of the environment. We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.63 to $5.73 on a before charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth of 36% over a record year in 2020.
Specifically, our outlook for each business, as it relates to our updating guidance, includes plumbing net sales growth of 24.5% to 25.5% with operating margins at or above 22.5%. Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 43% to 45% or 14% to 16%, excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14.5% to 15% or approximately 100 basis points higher adjusting for purchase accounting. Cabinets net sales growth of 14% to 15%, with operating margins between 10% and 11%.  We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $625 million to $675 million, which includes additional investments in working capital to improve service levels and capacity to accelerate growth. We anticipate a cash conversion rate of 80% to 85%. 
The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $108 million to $110 million; interest expense of approximately $83 million to $86 million; a tax rate of approximately 23% and average fully diluted shares of approximately $139 million to $140 million.
While short-term market challenges persist, we have the talent and capabilities to manage and offset these headwinds. And we'll continue to adjust quickly to the dynamic environment as merited. We delivered a record year in a challenging 2020 and will deliver a record year again in 2021. We are doing the hard work and making the critical investments necessary to outperform the market and to achieve our margin objectives. You've encountered us to capture value and effectively manage the business regardless of the speed bumps along the way.

Let me take that kind of 2 parts where we're seeing it and what's driving that performance. I'd tell you, just at the highest level, the demand has really been solid across the board, both across categories, price points and channels. I mean it's probably some of the most consistent demand we've seen anywhere.
And it's still backed by the long-term favorable trends we've talked about for a long time. The demographics continue to drive a lot of people into housing of boomers moving longer. The market is significantly underbuilt. You've got an aging housing stock. And so people are taking record levels of home equity and reinvesting. And all of that continues to be true.
And I think as we look, it was very interesting through the quarter because there were some laps from some really heavy comps this time last year as channels start to reopen. And I said we never saw the growth top moderated for a little bit as we work through those comps and then picked right back up. and sent them the gain.
So we're seeing it continue to hold very sustainably, and we're seeing it really kind of across the board. And I think that really speaks to the confidence that consumers have as well as just the fundamental need for either new or updated housing.
We are seeing elevated demand for oriented projects, as well as a lot of demand, I think, for premium offerings. We talked a bit about that. I think last quarter, we start to continue to really true. And again, it speaks to consumers a level of confidence in the home.
And then what's delivering the sustained momentum and outperformance for us? I think it's a combination of factors. I mean, one, we talked about taking funds and really driving reinvestment. We've set out a number of strategic priorities, brand, innovation, Fortune Brands advantage. That incremental investment year-to-date, we've spent just shy of $80 million, right? And so it's not for not that is going to drive the top line harder. I mean you see the planning results, and those are organic numbers just outstanding. We've had that flywheel gone for a while.
And then the other part, I think, is really across the supply chain. I mean it's been painful. We're tough on ourselves. But I think the fact that we've continued to perform at these elevated levels and the fact that we continue to gain share speaks to the fact that we are most likely outperforming from a supply chain perspective as well in serving customers and consumers. And so I think when you bring those 2 things together, the performance that we had at the pricing level as well as the performance in driving brand innovation, category management type capabilities across the top, you're getting the results that you're seeing now."

So I just wanted to be clear, maybe as a clarification that when you say in Cabinets, I believe you said or by the first quarter fully offset
To me, that means flat. I don't know if that's not what you meant, but -- and then for the full year of '22, I guess, on a consolidated basis as well, the 75 bps would then obviously result in something stronger than 75 bps in the coming quarters. I just wanted to make sure it's the right way to think about that and if that even then provides further momentum into '23?"

So it will be more on a year-over-year basis will more than offset with cost improvement and pricing actions, the inflation we anticipate in the first quarter of next year. 
And I would say that's true for the full year. But that's not the only lever that's going to help the 75 basis points of growth next year. We'll also be pursuing other cost improvement and structural cost improvement initiatives in the business, plus we'll be growing better than mid-single digits next year.
I'm not here to give '22 guidance, but we'll get some volume leverage. I wouldn't expect an even 75 basis points of margin improvement each quarter next year. That's not what we're trying to say, and I wouldn't interpret it that way. I would just say that we'll end this year with 50 basis points of margin improvement or thereabouts. And then off of that point, we'll make about 75 basis points of margin improvement through next year.
You will see a sound next year. I would expect next year to be somewhere in the 14% to 15% margin range in the first half. Across the first half, probably on the higher side of that 1 percentage point range there. So that's the way I would interpret it."

So -- and we've been consistent on this because we think it's an important part of our of our long-term growth strategy is we're driving attractive margins across price points at percentage basis and continue to work to make the margin percentages across our points as consistent as we can across our business.
Obviously, when you have premium products, it's bigger dollar margins. And all I would say is we have a business in plumbing. It's performing this year. It's going to be growing in the low 20-some percent, with a healthy contribution from the House of Rohl. And we're seeing throughout this year in Cabinets make-to-order cabinets growing at a percent that's consistent with the stock business. And those are things we point to as consumers' confidence in the value of their home and they're willing to invest in their home and they're willing to do contractor products as opposed to it's the overall driver of our margin journey.
Now what I would say happened in the quarter is Plumbing was particularly strong in the quarter. It has been particularly strong all year, and it will be that way in the fourth quarter as well. Plumbing having a disproportionate mix in our quarter across our businesses, definitely helped the margin profile of the quarter. We guided at the end of the second quarter. We would have been down 30 to 60 basis points in the third quarter. And largely, that was offset by a really exceptional both sales and margin performance by the Plumbing business.
But that, I think, speaks to the strength of Plumbing, inclusive of high-end premium brands. I wouldn't guide our journey this year, next year or beyond as a journey that's predicated on a mix of premium brands. That is not -- we're going to get the portfolio to the 16%, 17% margin percentage by 2023 that we laid out, kind of irrespective of the customer mix. We just referenced product mix, rather. We referenced it as a sign of consumers' confidence in the value of their home and their willingness to invest."

What I was referencin",667,"I'll talk to both of those at a higher level on the second of your question. So Mike, first of all, I'd start with this year because I'm not -- we're not here today to give you a '22 guidance, especially not at the piece point level. What I was referencing was the first part of '22 and our outlook for that first part of '22, just to give people a sign of where the run rate is.
So when I look at '21 -- fiscal '21, we're probably approaching about 7% inflation on last year's COGS base, which is starting to get almost to $300 million, pretty extraordinary. Where we were on the last call, we would have said around 6%. And so we've had a pretty appreciable increase since the second quarter call. And when I'm speaking here, I'm speaking to material, freight and tariffs only like this is not even the labor part of things, which we largely offset with continuous improvement. And of the bigger surges in the back half have been freight, in particular, ground freight and/or the mix of having to use spot rate containers, select metals, in particular, aluminum copper and zinc, and then hardwood and a few select resins that were affected by the Gulf.
And those are the things that surge in the back half more than we would have anticipated. We probably had about $40 million of that inflation impact in the back half since our second quarter guide. It's really affected all of our businesses but businesses like Cabinets and Therma-Tru and decking where you don't build up big inventories of components and/or finished goods and the inflation tends to course through your income statement in real time a bit more. That's why you're seeing the pressure in our updated guidance showing up in a slight margin refresh on cabinets and outdoors and security because unlike plumbing, it doesn't really go on to the balance sheet.
But there's inflation happening in plumbing and things like copper that are just going on to the balance sheet. And so we are taking incremental actions to offset them. We would have told you in the second quarter, we were positioned to offset everything within this year. But given the back half surge, it will take through to Q2.And we're confident we're going to offset it in the front part of next year.
And as next year plays out, we will provide you with updated inflation guidance and offsetting inflation guidance, as part of our '22 guide. All I would say about '22 inflation instead of getting in to the specific levels of it as we are expecting inflation in '22. We are not expecting deflation. We are expecting an inflationary environment. We're prepared for that. We do think it's going to be much more moderate than the middle part of this year when you had, in a very short period of time, trillions of dollars of government funds flowing into the economy and driving demand off of fixed cost base, our supply base and an already stretched global freight environment, even if the government does pass some measure of additional stimulus that's going to be over multiple years.
And so we've had a considerable surge in the spring and summer of this year. Government funding into consumer demand, that has really pushed inflation. We don't expect that level next year. So we expect to be able to offset it. And like I said, the challenges that you're seeing in our margin outlook for Cabinets and for O&S in the back half of the year, have to do with that inflation. They also have to do with the fact that labor, both because of the Delta variant and just because of the tight labor market, you have more labor turnover, more new employees and that ramp rate, both of bringing new people on and then getting them trained comes with some inefficiencies. So that's in our outlook as well."

And just firstly say with Evergreen, I mean is long, we had our eye on Evergreen so any evident exposure to very, very, very tremendous for us. And so that's not been that concerned. So we really look to the whole market.
We had some time in China, and we've got a phenomenal homegrown team now for us for a long, long time. And so we really understand the cycles of that market. And we went through a cycle in 2015, we went through a cycle in 2017. And if you go back and look at those numbers, you'll see new home sales plummeted and yet our business continued to grow. 
And so why is that? Well, it's a couple of things. Firstly, it just starts with our footprint. Our footprint is very focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We've never overexposed ourselves to the more speculative construction in Tier 3 and Tier 4, which is where you see the kind of the ghost towns, the big empty skyscrapers.
And so what do you have in 2016, I mean these are various established cities. We kind of have a mix in ecostructure you've got a big mix of -- and you look to like Shanghai where we have a very substantial share and you got an aging housing stock. So you're not just going to have the new construction development business, you're going to have a lot of turnover in that space.
And so we're going to continue to see growth just from redecoration and R&R in addition to what I call more sustainable new construction. But that's -- our footprint, so therefore, is less exposed to some of that secular stuff. 
The second piece is we've started 30-plus years ago with kind of the core loan business and of all of our businesses is the one that's both the greatest category adjacencies. I mean is the #1 sink brand in China. We both sanitary where it's been a resounding success yet in our penetration is in the single-digit market penetration of sanitary ware. And so a lot of room to kind of grow that over time.
And so that -- those category adjacencies will continue to power the business. And then there are also channel adjacencies as we shifted between developer to e-commerce channel. Our showroom position continues to be very strong. We've made sure to, a few years ago, not really focused on adding showrooms, but really improving the quality of showrooms and so that's really been the focus over the last couple of years.
And so those are good drivers. And then finally, you just have a team that's running a profitable business that have really built out their pricing and CI capabilities over the last, I'd say, 2 to 3 years and have much greater ability to flex the P&L to reinvest as they have been over the last couple of years but then to know when to be able to place it to continue to drive margins.
So you take those 3 things kind of our footprint, our adjacencies and then the capabilities that we have there. We're feeling confident that while the market may slow. And I think, frankly, is actually now going to start to migrate to being a more kind of stable, slower growth but more stable over time market. And we're actually quite enthusiastic about that shift. Our exposure is really good, and we'll continue to go with it."

So I'll give you some perspective, and Pat maybe have some color to add. But we've had this business in China, [indiscernible] a really great team and culture there and as part -- we interact with them very frequently, and we're coming their strategy together. And a few years ago, we sort of challenged them that notwithstanding the great growth that they were putting up. That they really needed to think as highly disciplined business operators and have the business on a continuous margin improvement journey really so they could generate their own fuel for growth.
And so we hired in capability. We've got much better revenue growth management there, a continual CI looking at the whole supply chain. And that team did exactly that. They started to push up their contribution margin, their OI margin and actually freed up a lot of incremental dollars to reinvest. We've been reinvesting in growing the Mount brand and then building that brand and creating more and more of a pull environment.
And so that just gives you a lot more optionality and in P&L management. I mean we don't have to invest heavily. I think if the market were to slow, we probably won't invest in brain building there as heavily as we have over the last couple of years. That gives us a lot of options to see in that in building come through as we've talked about some of the incremental spend that we've had here on strategic projects.
And then also, it just means that you have to soon the business to continue to be able to chase CI to chase offsetting COGS inflation and be able to pull the levers of the P&L to deliver continuously and so -- glad we put those in, but it's really predicated on ha strong discipline in the business because we want the business to be sustaining over the very long term."

I think that's been well appreciated.
We have continued to work hard. I mean, we referenced [indiscernible]. We had to qualify a number of suppliers very, very quickly on some very specialized products. And I think the team is really evolving moving really in an agile fashion to -- inside of weeks to do things like that.
And then when we talk about the Fortune Brands Advantage, if you recall kind of the 3 polars are complexity reduction, global supply chain management and category management and you take the first 2 complexity reduction and global supply chain management, I mean they've been invaluable. And so complexity reduction, I mean, we've used tools like lean 80/20 design to value, we're doing standard work to reduce our need for incremental headcount. And so really by using those, we've been able to actually eliminate just open positions that otherwise we would have had to fall and therefore, with a more simple business been able to kind of get after hitting these kinds of numbers. And I think that's going to be a very positive structural change in the business.
We're going to continue to drive that very, very hard because that just takes waste out. And so whether it's in this environment or in an easier environment, that's going to pay a lot of dividends. And then the global supply chain management has allowed us to leverage kind of everything we do across Fortune Brands.
So whether it's talking to suppliers, kind of across categories for direct or indirect, whether it's looking at freight lanes, either ocean freight or domestic freight, and seeing where we can leverage kind of the scale of the entire enterprise, all of that has come to bear. 
So -- It's actually worth to status. Our supply chain team have absolutely done hero this year, pulling on all those levers as well as our HR team and others. But it's the work that's done across. And I think it starts with the people and the safety, but then a bolt-on, the portion basins we've been talking to you about."

Our teams once again rose to the occasion to deliver an exceptional quarter, driving outperformance while facing tremendous supply chain headwinds, including challenges in labor, freight and material availability.
Demand for our products remains very strong, and we are working tirelessly to serve our customers while combating the global supply chain challenges facing most industries. The perseverance shown by our team members across our world-class brands has been nothing short of remarkable. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we can deliver even in the face of significant challenges. We remain firmly on track for a record year with exceptional growth and margin improvement and to reach the long-term goals for Fortune Brands that were communicated earlier this year.
For the third quarter, company sales increased 20% in total and 14% organically, with all segments driving strong growth. This past quarter marked an all-time record in quarterly sales as we neared $2 billion. Operating income increased 20% and earnings per share increased 25%, incredible results especially given the current external environment.
Demand for our products in the quarter was and remains robust, and we expect growth to persist as consumers continue to invest in housing. Our leading brands are well positioned to capitalize on these tailwinds, and our teams continue to drive share gains across the portfolio. Our mid-teens organic sales growth was complemented by LARSON, which is exceeding our expectations in terms of both performance and synergies.
I am proud of our team's ability to integrate this asset and drive performance, notwithstanding the challenging supply chain environment. Headwinds from supply chain, particularly in labor availability and freight and materials inflation, increased both during the quarter and relative to previous expectations. We are addressing these challenges by leveraging our Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities and through incremental price. Across the company, we are diligently working to meet continued strong demand while keeping our customers served and employees safe.
As global supply chains, labor and other inflationary pressures all remain dynamic, we've updated our 2021 financial guidance as was highlighted in our earnings press release earlier today. Pat will provide additional detail later in the call. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve exceptional growth and margin improvement in 2021 as well as towards our long-term targets communicated earlier this year.
Notwithstanding these external challenges, we continue to increase investment to drive the long-term growth and margin progression of the company. In the quarter, we furthered our strategic agenda and made more than $30 million of incremental investments behind our digital journey, brand, innovation and Fortune Brands' Advantage capabilities, while also delivering an operating margin on par with prior year. These investments were made in addition to the incremental investments made throughout last year.
For the full year, we expect to make operating margin progress of around 50 basis points versus a year ago while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to drive long-term stakeholder value creation. Our strategies are delivering in this environment, and those incremental investments should only accelerate our performance when the current pace of challenges moderates.
The company continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, and our balance sheet is strong. We're committed to efficient and effective capital deployment by investing in strategic capital projects, executing disciplined M&A transactions and returning dollars to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our leverage remains very healthy, and we have plenty of capacity to deploy additional capital for more value creation activity.
We recently chose to accelerate capacity investments in Moen, in The House of ROHL, Therma-Tru and Fiberon brands and expect excellent returns from these initiatives. Additionally, we repurchased $114 million of shares in the third quarter, and our year-to-date share repurchase total currently stands at over $380 million. As the company celebrated its 10-year anniversary of its spin-off and public listing in early October, cumulative capital returned to shareholders through repurchases alone surpassed $2.5 billion. 
Importantly, throughout our 10 years, we have also worked to serve all of our stakeholders from developing sustainable, innovative products and processes, to our best-in-class safety records, to our commitments to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG has long been a part of our culture. This past quarter, we made some exciting advancements in our ESG journey and unveiled a new website with an enhanced focus on ESG. We continue to receive recognition for our best-in-class safety record, including multiple awards for the work we do, keeping our employees safe.
In honor of our 10-year anniversary, we announced meaningful partnerships with 2 outstanding affordable housing organizations. I can't think of a better way to celebrate our milestone anniversary and to make this commitment to help make the dreams of home more attainable for many families in our communities. While there is more work to be done, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished.
Over the past decade, we have proven our ability to execute in any environment and to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value creation. This is possible because of the team of exceptional people across our organization who continue to make a difference, putting safety first, going above and beyond to serve our channel partners and customers in operating with a commitment to excellence. They are the flag carriers of our culture, which drive our resiliency and results. Thank you to all who work so hard each day, standing proudly behind our world-class brands that make an increasingly positive impact on people's homes, safety and communities.
Turning to the remainder of our remarks today. First, I will discuss what we're seeing in the home products market. I will then highlight key takeaways from our third quarter and provide additional color on what drove the results. Finally, Pat will provide highlights on our financial results, balance sheet strength and liquidity as well as thoughts around our updated guidance to our financial outlook for the full year.
Now turning to our view on the housing market. Long-term fundamentals for housing and home products remained very favorable. The significant deficit of homes available for sale and the structural underbuilding that is contributing to the current housing situation has been elongated by increasing labor, supply chain and material availability headwinds. While these challenges have made global headlines and will take time to normalize, it will take much longer, years, in fact, to work through the significant undersupply of up-to-date homes relative to demand. 
We saw some moderation in the pace of home sales versus Q3 of 2020. We view this moderation as a net positive, as it allows for a more sustainable long-term expansion of housing products while still driving very strong demand. Notwithstanding the moderation, demand for our products continue to persist ahead of supply. We also experienced some rebalancing of demand across channels. And between the rebalancing and the very strong but moderating home purchasing market, we believe the overall marketplace is on an even healthier footing for long-term sustainable growth than it was this time last year.
Within both the new construction and repair and remodel markets, we continue to see consumers focusing investment on the home. Demand for larger ticket and pro-oriented projects remains elevated, which squarely aligns with much of our product portfolio. These product categories are sold mostly through the trade, wholesale and builder channels, and we experienced strong, sustained momentum since before the pandemic. With our excellent relationships and preferred positioning in those channels, coupled with market leadership for our premium brands, we expect this momentum to continue and demand for our products to remain robust. 
We also saw consumers continue to spend up the price spectrum into premium offerings. We have seen this multi-quarter trend in both plumbing and cabinets and are also seeing this trend play out within our premium offerings in decking and doors. This sign of continued consumer confidence to invest in the home reflects both the health of the consumer and household balance sheets as well as consumers' growing aspirations for what the home can become.
Whether it be a new construction or repair and remodel markets, we believe we are optimally positioned to capture accelerated share leveraged by the best home products portfolio in the U.S. and have leadership positions in all of our brands. Driven by an advantaged set of channel positions, significant growth capital to deploy, and supported by our world-class people, we could not be more excited about the future.
With that market backdrop, some thoughts on the recent quarter. We had a stellar quarter even in the face of incremental supply chain headwinds. Demand was robust through the quarter and remains strong today across the whole portfolio. Our teams are working tirelessly to offset the numerous supply chain and labor constraints, and we're taking incremental actions to deliver both near-term results and long-term growth and margin objectives. 
Cumulatively, labor shortages and freight constraints were our most acute pressure points across the portfolio and are more challenging than even 90 days ago. We are responding with stronger measures in human capital attraction and retention strategies. At the same time, we're also leveraging our Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities to reduce complexity and minimize dependence on labor. We're also utilizing our scale and capabilities in global sourcing and logistics to optimize freight efficiency.
We're further developing and deploying our Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities and are funding strategic investments in key growth priorities, including in our digital journey, brand building and product innovation as well as in capacity and distribution expansion. These investments are contributing to our resiliency and as conditions normalize, we expect to continue to increase sales and margin, allowing for stronger capital deployment and investment which will drive our perpetual outperformance engine for the long term.
Now let me turn to our individual businesses and how we're positioning for long-term growth, starting with Plumbing. Our Global Plumbing Group once again significantly outperformed the global and U.S. markets this past quarter, taking share in every geographic region in which we operate. The business continues to fire on all cylinders with sales growth of 26% or 23% excluding FX. Our strong Plumbing sales drove operating leverage, resulting in a 22.6% operating margin for the quarter, notwithstanding increased investment in brand, innovation and improved customer service.
Our North American wholesale and e-commerce channels delivered strong double-digit growth, and we continue to grow in retail despite very elevated comps from the prior year. We are winning share and generating incremental investment dollars to pursue further above-market growth and margin.
In North America, our Plumbing business has never been stronger. We continue to be an industry leader in both innovation and key metrics on brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty among customers. Moen continues to lead in innovation and design and push new on-trend styles and functionality, including the recently launched Nebia by Moen's Quattro product line. This cutting-edge shower gives consumers the power to customize their experience while incorporating the Nebia by Moen's proprietary water saving technology, delivering on our water saving initiatives and ESG strategy.
As our business grows, we are also investing in incremental capacity across the supply chain, including a new distribution center opening this quarter. In China, Moen achieved strong double-digit growth, as our investments behind the Moen brand, category expansion and innovation continued to resonate with the Chinese consumer. Given our broad product offering, diverse channel exposure and increasingly relevant consumer brand, we see continued growth in China despite headwinds from a slowing new construction market.
As we've demonstrated in the past, our sales growth is driven by our innovation and category expansion efforts and is not tied tightly to the overall market. Additionally, we've built a resilient China business with a cost structure that could flex to preserve margin delivery. While we anticipate that there may be interim slowing of that marketplace, we are well equipped to outperform as we did during the last slowdown in 2017. 
Finally, the House of ROHL sales grew very strong double digits in all regions. Momentum in the luxury category has remained robust, and we expect demand to continue as consumers' willingness to invest and spend into larger ticket R&R remains significant. To keep up with this demand, we recently approved an investment to modernize and add capacity to our House of ROHL manufacturing facilities.  
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales increased by 30% and operating margin was 15.6%. Organically, sales increased 6% and were impacted by the very elevated comps due to the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 last year in doors and decking as our channels reopened following COVID shutdowns. Material and labor availability headwinds increased through the third quarter, and continue to impact operations across all brands, including material shortages caused by Hurricane Ida. Our teams are hard at work to offset these challenges, which have restrained us from achieving targeted output. 
Doors delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the quarter, reflecting constraints in labor and materials and very elevated comps due to the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 last year, as our channels reopened more fully after COVID shutdowns. Adjusting for the shift, sales increased mid-teens. Production interruptions to key component suppliers caused by Hurricane Ida affected supply in the quarter, though we worked diligently across our supply chain to resolve these challenges going forward. Underlying demand remains strong across channels, and we continue to work to service our customers at a high level.
Turning to Decking. Fiberon sales grew mid-single digits off of a very strong quarter last year that also included the shift of sales from Q2 to Q3 due to channel reopening. Adjusting for 2020 shipment cadence, sales increased around 20%. Our strategy of leveraging our deep customer relationships to partner with the leading distributors in each region continues to pay dividends as we remain in a sold-out position. We will be bringing incremental capacity online before year-end, and we expect fourth quarter sales growth to eclipse 25%.
We continue to leverage Fortune Brands' Advantage capabilities and other internal synergies to increase output and streamline costs. Our eco-friendly composite decking continues to resonate with consumers and remains in high demand as we take additional share from traditional wood decking. 
As I mentioned earlier, integration of LARSON continues to progress well, and the business is performing above expectations. Our teams across outdoors and security are working together to advance integration while capturing planned synergies.
Finally, within Security, we experienced continued success and momentum with high single-digit sales growth in the quarter as commercial, back-to-school and travel markets continue to rebound. Our key North American retail market for both locks and safes continues at levels stronger than prior to the start of the pandemic. The business is delivering on the Fortune Brands' Advantage investments made over the last couple of years and is now generating incremental fuel for reinvestment.
Now turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinets operations again delivered strong performance in the past quarter, with sales growing over 9% and operating margin of 9.7%. In an extremely tough environment, sales grew sequentially off of the strong Q2 and margins performed at industry-leading levels. Demand was equally strong on both stock and make to order, with the strongest momentum continuing in our premium offerings.
While labor challenges, material and freight inflation increased further, all are manageable and we continue to take price and deploy continuous improvement initiatives to offset these headwinds. Cabinets' margin performance in such a challenging and fast-evolving environment is a testament to how well our pivot plan and Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities are delivering. As the pace of challenges moderates and our pricing actions take further hold, the business will accelerate its progress towards its long-term margin objective.
Labor shortages and freight availability remain the biggest challenges impacting performance in margins in our Cabinets business. Our teams are deploying lean methodologies and complexity reduction strategies to ease these supply chain and labor limitations. Significant order backlog exists across the business and will be worked through into 2022. We remain committed to our long-term margin goals for Cabinets, and the business simplification progress that we made this year within our facilities will prove beneficial as we continue to solve our labor challenges and price realization catches up during the fourth quarter and into early 2022.
In summary, we continue to see very strong demand for our products and believe this housing cycle is being further elongated by current short-term acute headwinds. We're very focused on overcoming challenges and delivering in the short term. and we have built this company and its strong culture to win for the long term. Our commitment to excellence, each other and our brands, leveraged by innovation, investment and most importantly purpose, drives everything that we do. Our products positively impact people's lives every day, and we do not take that for granted. We are committed to growing stronger together and will do so in a sustainable way.
As we near the end of 2021 and look to 2022 and beyond, the actions that we are taking now and the investments that we are making and expect to make in the future should drive above-market growth and a stronger margin profile. We have a strong balance sheet and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital over the next few years. We're excited about the housing market and for the future of our company. We will remain steadfast in our mandate to create value, regardless of the environment. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Pat, who will speak to our financial results and updated guidance. Pat?"
33174798,1684382814,2413255,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Additionally, all comparisons will be made against the same quarter last year, unless otherwi",1411,"Thanks, Nick. And as a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Additionally, all comparisons will be made against the same quarter last year, unless otherwise noted.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.99 billion, up 20%. Organic sales excluding the LARSON acquisition, were up 14%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $293 million, up 20% or $49 million and total company operating margin was 14.8%, in line with the prior year period. EPS were $1.49 for the quarter, up 25%. These results reflect our team's tremendous performance in a highly disruptive environment, a testament to our culture of safety and outperformance across the organization.
Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the third quarter were $741 million, up $151 million or 26% or up 23% adjusting for FX. Our Plumbing business continues to gain share and drive growth across all major brands, channels and geographies. Plumbing operating income increased 36% to $168 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 22.6% despite significant investment during the quarter in our brands, strategic priorities and to serve our customers.
Turning to Outdoors & Security. Sales for the third quarter were $528 million, up $122 million or 30%, driven by the addition of LARSON and mid-single-digit organic growth. On an organic basis, sales were up 6% against an elevated comp from the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter last year in doors and decking, as our wholesale channels reopened following the COVID shutdowns these channels experienced.
Door sales were up mid-single digits in the third quarter, driven by wholesale and would have been up mid-teens adjusting for the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter in 2020. Reported results would have been even stronger within the quarter were it not for labor and material constraints, the latter the result of Hurricane Ida.
Decking sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter as Fiberon continued to sell out. Sales were up around 20% adjusting for the shift in sales from Q2 to Q3 last year. We expect incremental capacity to come online in the fourth quarter and are also increasing throughput by deploying process improvement. We expect fourth quarter decking sales growth to exceed 25%. 
Security sales continue to trend nicely with high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by returning strength in commercial, back-to-school and travel markets. Outdoors & Security operating income was $82 million during the quarter, up 24%, driven by the addition of LARSON and operating improvements in decking and security. Segment operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by inefficiencies caused by labor and material constraints in the quarter impacting doors and decking. 
Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the third quarter were $717 million, an increase of over 9% over the same quarter in 2020. We, again, saw strong demand across all price points during the quarter. Backlogs and lead times have extended during the quarter, and demand for contractor-led projects such as cabinets, remains very healthy. 
Operating income in the third quarter was $69 million, down 13% or $11 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.7%, down 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago as price increase realization trailed inflation and labor and material availability resulted in inefficiencies. We expect this relationship to improve significantly during the fourth quarter. 
By the first quarter of 2022, we expect continuous improvement and pricing actions to offset inflation fully and our rate of margin enhancement in cabinets to reaccelerate to our targeted objective. We remain well positioned to win in North America versus domestic competitors and imports. We expect to win increasing share and achieve our long-term margin objectives.
Before turning to the balance sheet and updated financial guidance, some thoughts on demand, supply and the current environment. Demand continues to be strong across the portfolio. Increasing headwinds from labor, freight availability and certain supply-constrained materials are being addressed. We are and expect to stay nimble as the situation warrants. We have made significant investments to serve continued strong demand and to increase service levels. We are also making further progress in deployment of our Fortune Brands Advantage capabilities to leverage synergies across the portfolio in sourcing and other improvement initiatives.
We are keenly focused on the current dynamic environment, contributing towards rising COGS and freight inflation. The decisive actions we are taking will allow us to offset fully these headwinds, maintain our long-term margin trajectory and will put us in an advantaged position for 2022.  
Through a combination of continuous improvement and thoughtful pricing actions, we plan to offset all inflationary headwinds during the first quarter of 2022 and to continue to target around 75-plus basis points of margin improvement during 2022. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $461 million, net debt of $2.2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now 1.7x. We ended the third quarter with approximately $410 million of available capacity on our revolver. We are advantageously positioned to deploy capital to the highest returning opportunities.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased over $380 million of shares and have repurchased over $2.5 billion in common stock in 10 years as a public company. Our investment-grade balance sheet and strong free cash flow provide fuel for continued investment into our businesses, propelling the flywheel of outperformance on the top line and accelerating common capability building and deployment across our portfolio to achieve higher margins.
I would now like to address our updated market and financial outlook. Demand for our products remain strong in a sound housing market. However, increasing headwinds from labor shortages, supply chain challenges and inflation have adjusted our expectations for full year 2021, based on the expectation that the global market for our products will now grow 11% to 12%, with the U.S. housing market growing 12% to 13%, and within this forecast, we now expect U.S. new construction growth of 11% to 12% and U.S. R&R growth of 13% to 14%. Based on these assumptions, our revised 2021 full year sales growth outlook is expected to be 24.5% to 25.5% or 17.5% to 18.5% on an organic basis. 
We continue to target meaningful margin progress and expect to deliver around 50 basis points of margin improvement during 2021, despite inflation that is almost 3x what we expected at the beginning of this year. We are tracking to our longer-term margin objectives, demonstrating our ability to accelerate value creation regardless of the environment. We now expect full year EPS within the range of $5.63 to $5.73 on a before charges and gains basis, of which the implied midpoint equates to earnings growth of 36% over our record year in 2020. 
Specifically, our outlook for each business as it relates to our updating guidance includes Plumbing net sales growth of 24.5% to 25.5% with operating margins at or above 22.5%. Outdoors & Security net sales growth of 43% to 45% or 14% to 16%, excluding LARSON, with segment operating margins of 14.5% to 15% or approximately 100 basis points higher adjusting for purchase accounting. Cabinets net sales growth of 14% to 15%, with operating margins between 10% and 11%. We expect 2021 free cash flow of approximately $625 million to $675 million, which includes additional investments in working capital to improve service levels and capacity to accelerate growth. We anticipate a cash conversion rate of 80% to 85%.
The revised full year EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: corporate expenses of about $108 million to $110 million; interest expense of approximately $83 million to $86 million; a tax rate of approximately 23% and average fully diluted shares of approximately 139 million to 140 million. 
While short-term market challenges persist, we have the talent and capabilities to manage and offset these headwinds and we'll continue to adjust quickly to the dynamic environment as merited. We delivered a record year in a challenging 2020 and we'll deliver a record year again in 2021. We are doing the hard work and making the critical investments necessary to outperform the market and to achieve our margin objectives. You can count on us to capture value and effectively manage the business regardless of the speed bumps along the way.
I will now pass the call back to Dave to conclude our prepared remarks."

I'd tell you, just at the highest level, the demand has really been solid across the board, both across categories, price points and channels. I mean it's p",477,"Sure. Let me take that kind of 2 parts, where we're seeing it and what's driving that performance. I'd tell you, just at the highest level, the demand has really been solid across the board, both across categories, price points and channels. I mean it's probably some of the most consistent demand we've seen anywhere.
And it's still backed by the long-term favorable trends we've talked about for a long time. The demographics continue to drive a lot of people into housing of boomers moving longer. The market is significantly underbuilt. You've got an aging housing stock. And so people are taking record levels of home equity and reinvesting. And all of that continues to be true.
And I think as we -- look, it was very interesting through the quarter because there were some laps from some really heavy comps this time last year as channels start to reopen. And I said we never saw the growth stop. It moderated for a little bit as we work through those comps and then picked right back up and sent them again.
So we're seeing it continue to hold very sustainably, and we're seeing it really kind of across the board. And I think that really speaks to the confidence that consumers have as well as just the fundamental need for either new or updated housing.
We are seeing elevated demand for pro-oriented projects, as well as a lot of demand, I think, for premium offerings. We talked a bit about that. I think last quarter, we said that continue to ring true. And again, it speaks to consumers' level of confidence in the home.
And then what's delivering the sustained momentum and outperformance for us? I think it's a combination of factors. I mean, one, we talked about taking funds and really driving reinvestment. We've set out a number of strategic priorities, brand, innovation, Fortune Brands Advantage. That incremental investment year-to-date, we've spent just shy of $80 million, right? And so it's not for naught. That is going to drive the top line harder. I mean you see the Plumbing results, and those organic numbers are just outstanding. We've had that flywheel gone for a while.
And then the other part, I think, is really across the supply chain. I mean it's been painful. We're tough on ourselves. But I think the fact that we've continued to perform at these elevated levels and the fact that we continue to gain share speaks to the fact that we are most likely outperforming from a supply chain perspective as well in serving customers and consumers. And so I think when you bring those 2 things together, the performance that we had at this pricing level as well as the performance in driving brand innovation, category management type capabilities across the top, you're getting the results that you're seeing now."

So I just wanted to be clear, maybe as a clarification that when you say in Cabinets, I believe you said -- or by the first quarter fully offset.
To me, that means flat. I don't know if that's not what you meant, but -- and then for the full year of '22, I guess, on a consolidated basis as well, the 75 bps would then obviously result in something stronger than 75 bps in the coming quarters.

So it will be more on a year-over-year basis will more than offset with cost improvement and pricing actions, the inflation we anticipate in the first quarter of next year.
And I would say that's true for the full year. But that's not the only lever that's going to help the 75 basis points of growth next year. We'll also be pursuing other cost improvement and structural cost improvement initiatives in the business, plus we'll be growing better than mid-single digits next year.
I'm not here to give '22 guidance, but we'll get some volume leverage. I wouldn't expect an even 75 basis points of margin improvement each quarter next year. That's not what we're trying to say, and I wouldn't interpret it that way. I would just say that we'll end this year with 50 basis points of margin improvement or thereabouts. And then off of that point, we'll make about 75 basis points of margin improvement through next year.
You will see a sound next year. I would expect next year to be somewhere in the 14% to 15% margin range in the first half. Across the first half, probably on the higher side of that 1 percentage point range there. So that's the way I would interpret it."

So -- and we've been consistent on this because we think it's an important part of our of our long-term growth strategy is we're driving attractive margins across price points at percentage basis and continue to work to make the margin percentages across our points as consistent as we can across our business.
Obviously, when you have premium products, it's bigger dollar margins. And all I would say is we have a business in plumbing. It's performing this year. It's going to be growing in the low 20-some percent, with a healthy contribution from the House of ROhL. And we're seeing throughout this year in Cabinets made-to-order cabinets growing at a percent that's consistent with the stock business. And those are things we point to as consumers' confidence in the value of their home and they're willing to invest in their home and they're willing to do contractor products as opposed to it's the overall driver of our margin journey.
Now what I would say happened in the quarter is Plumbing was particularly strong in the quarter. It has been particularly strong all year, and it will be that way in the fourth quarter as well. And Plumbing having a disproportionate mix in our quarter across our businesses definitely helped the margin profile of the quarter. We guided at the end of the second quarter we would have been down 30 to 60 basis points in the third quarter. And largely, that was offset by a really exceptional both sales and margin performance by the Plumbing business.
But that, I think, speaks to the strength of Plumbing, inclusive of high-end premium brands. I wouldn't guide our journey this year, next year or beyond as a journey that's predicated on a mix of premium brands. That is not -- we're going to get the portfolio to the 16%, 17% margin percentage by 2023 that we laid out, kind of irrespective of the customer mix. We just referenced product mix, rather. We referenced it as a sign of consumers' confidence in the value of their home and their willingness to invest."

So Mike, first of all, I'd start with this year because I'm not -- we're not here today to give you a '22 guidance, especially not at the piece point level. What I was referencing was the first part of '22 and our outlook for that first part of '22, just to give people a sign of where the run rate is.
So when I look at '21 -- fiscal '21, we're probably approaching about 7% inflation on last year's COGS base, which is starting to get almost to $300 million, pretty extraordinary. Where we were on the last call, we would have said around 6%. And so we've had a pretty appreciable increase since the second quarter call. And when I'm speaking here, I'm speaking to material, freight and tariffs only, like this is not even the labor part of things, which we largely offset with continuous improvement. And some of the bigger surges in the back half have been freight, in particular ground freight, and/or the mix of having to use spot rate containers, select metals, in particular aluminum, copper and zinc, and then hardwood and a few select resins that were affected by the Gulf.
And those are the things that surged in the back half more than we would have anticipated. We probably had about $40 million of that inflation impact in the back half since our second quarter guide. It's really affected all of our businesses but businesses like Cabinets and Therma-Tru and decking where you don't build up big inventories of components and/or finished goods and the inflation tends to course through your income statement in real time a bit more, that's why you're seeing the pressure in our updated guidance showing up in a slight margin refresh on Cabinets and Outdoors & Security because unlike Plumbing, it doesn't really go on to the balance sheet.
But there's inflation happening in Plumbing in things like copper that are just going on to the balance sheet. And so we are taking incremental actions to offset them. We would have told you in the second quarter, we were positioned to offset everything within this year. But given the back half surge, it will take through to Q2. And we're confident we're going to offset it in the front part of next year.
And as next year plays out, we will provide you with updated inflation guidance and offsetting inflation guidance as part of our '22 guide. All I would say about '22 inflation instead of getting in to the specific levels of it as we are expecting inflation in '22. We are not expecting deflation. We are expecting an inflationary environment. We're prepared for that. We do think it's going to be much more moderate than the middle part of this year when you had, in a very short period of time, trillions of dollars of government funds flowing into the economy and driving demand off of fixed cost base or supply base and an already stretched global freight environment, even if the government does pass some measure of additional stimulus that's going to be over multiple years.
And so we've had a considerable surge in the spring and summer of this year. Government funding into consumer demand, that has really pushed inflation. We don't expect that level next year. So we expect to be able to offset it. And like I said, the challenges that you're seeing in our margin outlook for Cabinets and for O&S in the back half of the year, have to do with that inflation. They also have to do with the fact that labor, both because of the Delta variant and just because of the tight labor market, you have more labor turnover, more new employees and that ramp rate, both of bringing new people on and then getting them trained comes with some inefficiencies. So that's in our outlook as well."

And so any Evergrande exposure could be very, very, very de minimis for us. And so that's not been a concern. And so we really looked through the whole market.
And we had some time in China, and we've got a phenomenal homegrown team there that's been with us for a long, long time. And so we really understand the cycles of that market. And we went through a cycle in 2015, we went through a cycle in 2017. And if you go back and look at those numbers, you'll see new home sales plummeted and yet our business continued to grow.
And so why is that? Well, it's a couple of things. Firstly, it just starts with our footprint. Our footprint is very focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We've never overexposed ourselves to the more speculative construction in Tier 3 and Tier 4, which is where you see the kind of the ghost towns, the big empty skyscrapers.
And so what do you have in Tier 1 and Tier 2? I mean these are various established cities where you kind of have a mix of new construction, but you've got a big mix of R&R. And you look to a city like Shanghai where we have very substantial share and you got an aging housing stock. So you're not just going to have the new construction development business, you're going to have a lot of turnover in that space.
And so we're going to continue to see growth just from redecoration and R&R in addition to what I call more sustainable new construction. But that's -- our footprint, so therefore, is less exposed to some of that speculative stuff.
The second piece is we've started 30-plus years ago with kind of the core loan business and of all of our businesses it's the one that's both the greatest category adjacencies. I mean we have the #1 sink brand in China. We have both sanitary ware. It's been a resounding success and yet -- and our penetration is in the single-digit market penetration of sanitary ware. And so a lot of room to kind of grow that over time.
And so that -- those category adjacencies will continue to power the business. And then there are also channel adjacencies as we shifted between developer to e-commerce channel. Our showroom position continues to be very strong. We've made sure to -- a few years ago, not really focused on adding showrooms, but really improving the quality of showrooms and so that's really been the focus over the last couple of years.
And so those are good drivers. And then finally, you just have a team that's running a profitable business that have really built out their pricing and CI capabilities over the last, I'd say, 2 to 3 years and have much greater ability to flex the P&L to reinvest as they have been over the last couple of years but then to know when to be able to flex it to continue to drive margins.
So you take those 3 things as kind of our footprint, our adjacencies and then the capabilities that we have there. We're feeling confident that while the market may slow, and I think, frankly, is actually now going to start to migrate to being a more kind of stable, slower growth but more stable over time market, and we're actually quite enthusiastic about that shift. Our exposure is really good, and we'll continue to grow with it."

So I'll give you some perspective, and Pat maybe have some color to add. But we've had this business in China, phenomenal growth and a really great team and culture there, and as part -- we interact with them very frequently, and we're coming out of mistakes together. And a few years ago, we sort of challenged them that notwithstanding the great growth that they were putting up, that they really needed to think as highly disciplined business operators and have the business on a continuous margin improvement journey really so they could generate their own fuel for growth.
And so we hired in capability. We've gotten much better at revenue growth management there, a continual CI looking at the whole supply chain. And that team did exactly that. They started to push up their contribution margin, their OI margin and actually freed up a lot of incremental dollars to reinvest. We've been reinvesting in growing the Moen brand and then building that brand and creating more and more of a pull environment.
And so that just gives you a lot more optionality in P&L management. I mean we don't have to invest heavily. I think if the market were to slow, we probably won't invest in brand building there as heavily as we have over the last couple of years. That gives us a lot of options. You've seen the brand building come through as we've talked about some of the incremental spend that we've had here on strategic projects.
And then also, it just means that you've got scope during the business to continue to be able to chase CI, to chase offsetting COGS inflation and be able to pull the levers of the P&L to deliver continuously. And so -- but, glad we put those in, but it's really predicated on having strong discipline in the business because we want the business to be sustaining over the very long term."

I mean we've had to work across many, many fronts to deliver this kind of performance. I mean, I'd say, first and foremost, it just starts with safety and the safety measures and investments that we've put into our facilities that have allowed us to manage through the pandemic and then also hopefully be attractive to continuing to attract and retain talent. I think that's been well appreciated.
We have continued to work hard. I mean, we referenced Hurricane Ida. We had to qualify a number of suppliers very, very quickly on some very specialized products. And I think the team is really evolving to moving really in an agile fashion to -- inside of weeks to do things like that.
And then when we talk about the Fortune Brands Advantage, if you recall kind of the 3 pillars are complexity reduction, global supply chain management and category management and you take the first 2, complexity reduction and global supply chain management, I mean they've been invaluable. And so complexity reduction, I mean, we've used tools like lean 80/20, design-to-value, we're doing standard work to reduce our need for incremental headcount. And so really by using those, we've been able to actually eliminate just open positions that otherwise we would have had to fill and therefore, with a more simple business, been able to kind of get after hitting these kinds of numbers. And I think that's going to be a very positive structural change in the business.
We're going to continue to drive that very, very hard because that just takes waste out. And so whether it's in this environment or in an easier environment, that's going to pay a lot of dividends. And then the global supply chain management has allowed us to leverage kind of everything we do across Fortune Brands.
So whether it's talking to suppliers, kind of across categories for direct or indirect, whether it's looking at freight lanes, either ocean freight or domestic freight, and seeing where we can leverage kind of the scale of the entire enterprise, all of that has come to bear. 
So -- it's actually worth a shout out to our supply chain team who have absolutely been heroes this year, pulling on all those levers as well as our HR team and others. But it's the work that's done across. And I think it starts with the people and the safety, but then it builds on this Fortune Brands Advantage that we've been talking to you about."
