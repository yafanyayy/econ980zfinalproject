177934,698648323,2185729,"L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone.

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter results, and I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their continued dedication and perseverance through 2020. Despite COVID, we met customer commitments, advanced the integration and delivered bottom line results ahead of initial expectations, all while keeping our workforce safe. We'll continue to follow mitigation plans implemented at the onset of the pandemic and keep them in place until widespread vaccinations have occurred.
As a combined company, we're successfully executing the strategy we laid out 1.5 years ago to drive shareholder value, and our progress is reflected in our operating results and outlook. First, we delivered solid results in 2020, where we exceeded our initial guidance on margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, offsetting the negative impacts of the pandemic with a solid 7% growth in our core U.S. government business and modest growth on the international side. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% from synergies and operational excellence and drove earnings per share up 13%, consistent with our double-digit growth framework.
With an 8-day improvement in working capital, we also generated strong free cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion. This, along with progress on portfolio shaping, enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders and deliver growth in free cash flow per share of over 10%.
Second, our guidance for the current year shows continued momentum in the business. With the fiscal '21 budget now set and broad program support across key areas, we're in a position to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth at the midpoint, underpinned by the building blocks we previously described. Our DoD portfolio is well aligned with national security priorities. And while the overall budget is flat, we expect at least low single-digit growth driven by space, maritime, DoD modernization and classified programs.
Revenue synergies will contribute about 1 point of growth, with the notable driver being the SDA tracking layer award, as well as continued traction elsewhere with a win rate of about 2/3 of the 40 proposals awarded to date.
On the international front, we expect another -- about another point for mid-single-digit growth plus, backed by a funded book-to-bill of above 1 in 2020 and a growing pipeline of pursuits. And then finally, in our commercial businesses, we foresee a more modest impact of full year results as we lap COVID pressures following the first quarter.
We also expect another year of margin expansion, supported by increased synergies and continued operational excellence, net of dilution from new program starts. We exited the year at $270 million in net cumulative synergy savings, $20 million ahead of our prior estimate. And with more confidence in savings from the supply chain, facility rationalization, shared services and functional efficiencies, we're now increasing our cumulative savings to $320 million to $350 million in 2021, up from a prior estimate of $300 million plus and still a year ahead of schedule.
Our free cash flow guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion demonstrates clear progress towards our $3 billion target in 2022, with all cash used for capital returns to support double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth.
Yesterday, we announced that our Board approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization alongside a 20% increase in our dividend, the third raise since we closed and bringing us closer to our target of a 30% to 35% payout of free cash flow.
And then finally, we continue to position the business for long-term value creation by exiting noncore businesses and focusing our significant R&D investment on a more strategic technology-based business areas. We're now in the latter stages of several portfolio-shaping processes, and we'll look to provide updates over the coming months. Our expectation continues to be for divestitures to represent a cumulative 8% to 10% of revenue, with about 1/3 completed to date and all proceeds going towards repurchases. And we'll continue to sustain R&D spending at a peer high of nearly 4% of revenue with a focus on open architecture, multifunction, software-defined solutions across our broad C5ISR portfolio of capabilities. These technologies are essential to encountering near-peer threats across all domains, and our past investments were the driver behind the recent SDA tracking layer, HBTSS and next-gen jammer wins.
So overall, we're clearly making progress in building a high-performance, technology-focused operating company and positioning L3Harris as a full end-to-end mission solutions prime.
And with that, let me turn it over to you, Chris."

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contra",1097,"Okay. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contracts for the medium unmanned surface vehicle program and a classified undersea acoustic systems program, which alongside an important win on the U.S. Navy Frigate program affirms our strategy to establish ourselves as both a prime contractor and a systems integrator. This progress was offset by a moderate decline in Electro Optical due to program timing and in ISR due to aircraft timing. Our prior guidance assumed a December contract for ISR aircraft from an international customer that was delayed due to the customer's decision to expand the program. We are now awaiting parliamentary approval for that program.
For the full year, revenue was up 3.3% from double-digit growth in Maritime and low single-digit growth in ISR. Operating income was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. And margins expanded 100 basis points to 14.3% and 230 basis points to 15.3% for the quarter and year, respectively. Our ISR business made significant progress on its international strategy with a contract to provide missionized ISR aircraft for the Canadian Air Force, capabilities on a maritime patrol aircraft for a customer in the Asia Pacific region and the introduction of potted capability for unmanned aircraft for deployment in Europe and Asia. We have a strong pipeline as our allies appreciate the need for situational awareness that our systems provide.
In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.8% for the quarter from a ramp on the F-35 as we transition from development to production on the next-generation mission systems in our mission avionics sector and growth in space from new program wins. This growth was partially reduced by low single-digit decline in our Intel and Cyber due to program timing.
For the full year, organic revenue increased 5.8% from the F-35 ramp and classified growth in Intel and Cyber. Space and Electronic Warfare were down due to in-year program transition, but recent wins position space to be a key growth driver for 2021. 
Operating income was up 13% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the year, and margins expanded 150 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter and 20 basis points to 18.8% for the year. Overall, our Space business had a transformative year as we've been awarded contracts within the missile defense area, including the Space Development Agency's tracking layer and more recently here in January on the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor program, or HBTSS, culminating multiple years of investment in innovation.
On HBTSS, our team will develop a prototype satellite that will demonstrate our capability to detect and track hypersonic weapons in space. The initial launch is targeted for 2023 with an opportunity to build out a constellation thereafter. These competitive wins have potential value of over $5 billion, uniquely positioning L3Harris to play a lead role with multiple agencies and mark the culmination of a successful multiyear repositioning strategy establishing ourselves as a mission solutions prime with our responsive satellites and within missile defense.
Next, Communications Systems organic revenue was up 3.4% for the quarter, driven by tactical growth of 17% that included record international sales, up over 30% from the Mid East and Central Asia and continued DoD modernization. This strength was partially offset by anticipated weakness in our Public Safety business due to COVID-19 as well as a decline in Integrated Vision Systems from international program timing. Full year revenue was up 4.4%, driven by 13% growth in Tactical Communications, primarily from the ramp in DoD modernization programs, which also benefited Integrated Vision Solutions.
As anticipated, we saw solid international growth of 4% in Tactical Communications, with major wins in Australia, Europe and the Mid East. Total Communications Systems orders in Australia exceeded $200 million, with contracts for tactical radios and waveforms supporting crypto modernization requirements and the LAND 53 next-gen night vision goggle program. The 17% decline in PSBC was consistent with expectations and should ease post the first quarter.
Operating income was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year, and margins expanded 280 basis points to 25.9% and 200 basis points to 24.4% for the quarter and year, respectively. Our broadband business had a major strategic win, with the prime contract award for the U.S. Navy's next-generation jammer low-band program for nearly $500 million, highlighting our advanced technology and innovative solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate in, in the future. The program comes with follow-on opportunities in the $4 billion range and demonstrates our standing as a leader in spectrum superiority and electronic warfare for legacy and next-gen platforms. This multiyear pursuit validates our strategy to be a prime and provide leading-edge technical solutions to our customers.
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 11% in the quarter and 3% for the year as expected due to COVID-19-related impacts in the Commercial Aviation business. Growth with our U.S. government customers remained healthy in defense avionics from a ramp on classified programs and ground vehicle systems and mission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was down 22% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the year, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses as cost actions and growth in defense, aviation, mission networks mitigated our commercial headwinds. Margins were flat at 14.9% in the quarter. Full year margins, however, expanded 100 basis points to 13.8%. Notable activity in the quarter included $142 million order from the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center to continue the development of the next-gen EMCO GPS receivers with inception-to-date awards at over $0.5 billion.
Over the last few months, we've successfully positioned ourselves for growth with notable awards that represent opportunities in the multibillion-dollar range. These wins provide a long-term visibility and highlight the strength of our portfolio in a range of budget environments and across multiple domains. With a healthy backlog of $22 billion, that's up nearly 80% for the year, adjusting for divestitures. And a funded book-to-bill of 1.04, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth.
As we think about 2021, we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities that are focused on growing the top line, advancing the integration, expanding margins through flawless execution and continuous improvement, reshaping our portfolio and maximizing cash flow to support capital returns.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Fourth quarter organic revenue was flat, largely driven by the effects of the pandemic and aircraft timing as our core U.S. government business was up about 4%, with the international side up modestly. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18.5%, primarily from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management. Earnings per share of $11.60 was better than we expected and grew 10% or $0.29, as shown on Slide 9. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.47, along with a lower share count for $0.15, which more than compensated for the headwinds from divestitures and pandemic-impacted end markets. For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%, with our core U.S. government business up 7% and international up 1 point, partially offset by the impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic.
Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guide, with integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 13% or $1.34, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 4% lower share count, enabling us to deliver on our double-digit growth target.
Solid fourth quarter free cash flow of $642 million resulted in the full year coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. With this cash flow, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock and paid $725 million in dividends.
Okay. Now switching over to the 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Starting with the top line. Organic revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5%, reflecting growth in every segment, with a light first quarter as we lap pandemic-related impacts and phase in new programs. On full year EBIT, we expect total company margins to be 18% to 18.5%, a 25 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint, primarily driven by increased cost synergies, operational excellence and pension, net of mix headwinds from space, IMS and tactical radios. This, combined with a 4% lower share count, will result in 2021 EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13 per share, up double digits at the midpoint versus 2020.
On free cash flow, our guide implies nearly $14 per share at the midpoint and clear traction with our growth framework. This reflects a 3-day working capital improvement to 51 days, $375 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. Our guidance also reflects approximately $2.3 billion in share repurchases, excluding divestitures, as part of our recently approved buyback authorization. And following yesterday's announced dividend increase, this will be our third hike since the merger, representing a cumulative increase of about 50%, reflecting our confidence in continued cash generation. All told, we expect to return $3.1 billion to shareholders this year before accounting for any divestiture proceeds that will be additive. 
Switching over to the segments. Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6%, driven by ISR aircraft missionization demand and maritime from recent wins. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 15.5% at the midpoint as operational excellence, synergy savings and pension benefits are netted by program mix impacts.
In Space and Airborne Systems, we expect organic revenue to be up 4% to 6%, driven by traction in space and continued classified strength in Intel and Cyber. Segment operating margin of 18.5% at the midpoint is driven by mix headwinds from key growth programs that outweigh E3 productivity, pension and integration benefits.
Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% from continued modernization growth in DoD tactical as well as international growth in Integrated Vision Solutions. Public Safety will have a modest headwind in the year as COVID-related impacts lap in the first quarter of 2021, with a recovery later in the year. Segment margins are anticipated to be 24.5% at the midpoint from operational excellence and synergies, partially offset by product mix within tactical radios.
And lastly, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3%, driven by continued growth in our U.S. government businesses from a ramp on combat propulsion systems and classified programs, which will be moderated by a slight decrease in commercial aerospace for the year. Segment margins of 14% at the midpoint reflect improvement driven by operational excellence, cost management and synergy savings.
Okay. Turning to the EPS slide and bridge on Slide 11. Expected full year EPS of $12.80 at the midpoint reflects 10% growth. Of this, operations and synergies will contribute $0.44, along with a lower share count for $0.57 and pension and other items of $0.26, more than offsetting the $0.07 headwind from completed divestitures.
All right. So just putting it all together, 2020 performance is demonstrating the resilience of our earnings and cash-generating power and the 2021 outlook reflecting further progress against our financial targets, with recurring double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth, driven by a rising top line as well as industry-leading margins and capital returns.
Okay. One last item before getting to your questions. I know there's been interest in a deeper look into our company as well as our growth drivers. So on March 10, we'll start with a virtual business briefing focusing on 2 of our segments: Space and Airborne Systems and Integrated Mission Systems. They'll be followed by a closer look at our other businesses at a later date.
Okay. With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions."

It's sort of a standard practice at the start of a new administration to take a pause on some of these more contentious exports to certain countries, so number one. Two, we're not an arms or weapons provider, so I'm not sure it really affects us very much. But when we look at sales into the region in those 2 countries, net of backlog, it's less than 1% of our revenue. So it's relatively small. And then third, it's likely just a matter of timing.

Look, we're a very different business today than we were 7, 8, 9 years ago when a lot of the dot-com business was driven by repairs, resets. It really wasn't focused on a program of record, but that's very different today. So really stepping back, when we think about our company as a whole, we've got total backlog at the end of last year at about 1.2x of revenue. So it's a little bit less than what we see with our peers. So we're a shorter cycle, if you will, but we're not necessarily short cycle. We've got a piece of the business, and you hit some of the key ones that radios, night vision goggles, maybe a couple of other spots that are -- that have backlog less than 1x of revenue. So for those businesses in particular, most of them are on programs of records today, they're well supported, they're in the early innings of modernization. We feel very good about that.
I'll take tactical radio for the minute on the DoD side. As we know, there's 350,000 to 400,000 radios that will be upgraded. They're about 10% of the way through there. You can see in the budget in '21 continue to be well supported in terms of revenue -- in terms of budget authority for radio monetizations. And we're in the front end of a long modernization curve on tactical radios. The same thing is on the international side. There's more than a dozen countries on the front end of modernization. A lot of them announced a couple hundred thousand radios, $4 billion worth of pipeline. So again, we're in the front end of modernization ramp on the international side, which, as you know, tends to follow what happens in the U.S.
And then you mentioned night vision goggles. We are on a sole-source directed requirement for ENVGB. We delivered about 5,000 goggles to date. We're on a program of record, which was announced in September, which we're one of the awardees for that, 100,000-plus night vision goggles. So we're 5% of the way through, again with very clear budget visibility.
So when you look at where we're at of modernization and visibility into the budgets, we think the outlook is very, very positive for all of those ""shorter-cycle"" businesses, Gautam Khanna."

Total impact, most of which was small suppliers, is about $100 million of outflow. I say the other piece of it was it's just a little bit of a timing issue between cash taxes. And so there is some timing of cash that was more in 2020 that was paid versus what we'd originally expected. That will be a benefit in 2021. So those are the 2 primary drivers in 2020. 2021, we -- as I mentioned, we're relying on 3 days of working capital. We'll also get a benefit from these cash tax a little bit better than we expected. And those are really the 2 major drivers.
And just speaking -- going back to working capital. We continue to drive while it's 3 days. Our opportunity set is substantially bigger than that. So there's runway beyond 2020, even in -- I'm sorry, 2021, even in 2021, where our projects by our sectors, by our segments are pretty well defined, particularly in inventory. And we've got a really nice, I think, a road map to deliver 2021 and beyond going forward. And so these -- I'd say the moving pieces are not much different from what we've talked about in the past. Really focus on working capital to make that not a use of cash and make it either neutral or a source of cash and dropping through the net income. 2021, as I mentioned, we'll get a little bit of a tax benefit, but really kind of set the stage for continued cash flow growth beyond '21 as well."

We have good leadership there. It was lots of pieces that were well integrated together. We're not completely through all that, but we're making really good progress. 2020 was a very strong year. It was up double digits. The orders were really strong. Book-to-bill came in above 1. In fact, reasonably above 1. We see continued growth in calendar '21. We're calling in the mid-single-digit range, but lots of good indicators of continued growth there. We just have a very solid position. We do a lot of work on power conversion, power distribution, towed arrays, mass, sonars, crypto, a bunch of different things. And we've got a great position on the unmanned side as well. So it's pretty broad-based. It's across both OE and service, U.S., international. So we demand and unmanned. So we like the position that we happen to have.
On the manned side, we've got good content on both Columbia and Virginia. Those programs are well supported, and Chris talked about the future frigate with Fincantieri. We've got a very strong position in content on the future frigate. Those all look really good and well supported. And on the unmanned side, I think we're on the front end of this. It's not a big part of the business today, but it's growing. We're the only prime of any unmanned maritime vessel here for the U.S. Navy. It's the MUSV, or the medium unmanned surface vessel, we're the prime on that. It's a pretty good contract we're executing on. We've got a study on the LUSV, which is the large unmanned service vehicle vessel. We're doing mine countermeasure systems. I think we talked about in the press release about a Phase 2 within Europe with a partner where we're providing substantial content for unmanned mine countermeasure systems and then all the underwater side. Really can't talk about -- on the classified business, but we've got a very strong position on undersea classified capabilities as well. So overall, a very good business with the hope in the direction we'd likely see in the budget of more growth-focused on the Navy given where the future threats happen to be.

And then on F-35 and Mission Avionics, we have multiple systems that we're providing to Lockheed, as you well know, especially on the -- what we're calling TR3, the Tech Refresh 3. So we're going through a transition from developed into production. We think longer term, there's numerous opportunities for additional content that we could provide.

We see international mid-single-digit plus, some headwinds coming from commercial. But you're exactly right, as you start to get out into '22 from '21, we'll see less of maybe no commercial headwinds and maybe eventually starts to turn into a tailwind. We see international as the front end of a build. Again, we're very underpenetrated. We have 20% of our revenues in international. I think Chris laid out a growth target there. We did -- we performed very well in the back half of last year. It was up low to mid-single digits. We had a very good Q3. And we've got some good momentum coming into this year, a very big pipeline of our $67 billion total company pipeline, [ $16 billion ] of which is in international. So we've got a lot of opportunities we're chasing on the international front. And again, we've talked about the revenue synergies, about 1 point, call it, $150 million to $200 million net incremental in '21 from '20, we're still at the front end of the build. So we have 40 proposals that have been awarded. We won 2/3 of them, but there's 70 that are submitted. So another 30 to be awarded or not. There's more that are happening in the future. So we hope to continue to build on that and we do hope -- just given the positioning of ourselves within the DoD budget, that low to single-digit -- low single-digit growth from DoD could actually grow over time because we're in great places that are going to continue to get funded. But we're also growing as a mission solutions provider going after a larger addressable market. So put all those pieces together, yes, that could drive acceleration beyond '21.

We're across all the services, across all the contract vehicles. Very strong position in the Marine Corps was a big driver of us in 2020. And we're sole-sourced on HF radios. We're sole-sourced there on Manpack. We'll compete on the handheld this year. We're sole-sourced across SOCOM. Army, we compete versus Thales and Collins. But the fact is, I think given the momentum that we have here, we see continued share gains within those areas as well within the Army. So I think we're well positioned. The budgets are very supportive. When you look at all tactical radio in total in '21 over '20, the budgets themselves are up about 25%. HMS is up 16%, 17%. So there's very good continued budget coverage here. We're starting the year with mid-single-digit growth in DoD. We're coming off a very strong '20 and an even stronger '19. So maybe, hopefully, there's some conservatism built into that. But there's some competition happening this year, and we'll keep evaluating and updating investors through the year on just our progress in DoD.

Look, I think there's going to be continued focus on the space domain, which we have spent a number of years repositioning the company to go after. Last year, it was a softer year, it was a transition year. We had a couple of program transitions. But you see in Q4 we came back very, very strongly. We're up high single digits. We'll be up high single digits in '21. We've got good wins. I mean, Chris walked through some of the key ones there. And frankly, that's just going to be -- continue to be a growth area. And you heard some of the commentary from Secretary Austin's commentary at his hearing about the focus on space and there. And it's not just across deal. There's a lot of classified community investments going on in the space. So I think, number one, we've got a really good position there going from components to systems and I think a proven strategy. I think some of the things that's happening on the unmanned side are opportunities for the future, both on maritime as well as on the airborne side, we've got really strong positions in both sides. I think that's going to continue to be well funded.
At the end of the day, any fight in the future, particularly against the near-peer competitors, will require network -- network platforms and not just simply platform improvements themselves, so how they work together. That requires resilient communications. Strong, secure, resilient communications. And that is the sweet spot of the company. We keep talking about that. It's very, very important. And there's really no one that's better positioned to enable that Jad C2 mission environment than where we happen to be. That's why we're on all of the ABMS contract vehicles. I think we've just had a great position there. That's going to continue to be well supported. So those are the areas that I think are going to be where we're best positioned. 
And I know what everyone else is talking about. We're sitting there with almost 4% of our revenue in IRAD. We're focusing our company. We've got a very unique situation with this merger where we can start off with a clean sheet and get all of our segments built from the day 1 to collaborate together, and that's why we're seeing traction here on the revenue synergies. So you put all those pieces together, and that's why I do believe that we've got just a strong powerful portfolio of businesses with good leadership that should outgrow our competitors into the future."

And then the modernization, is it going to be new platforms or upgrading existing platforms? And then there's always the focus on strategic deterrence. So the types of systems and the type of capabilities we have across all domains, I think, position us well. There was a question earlier about our content on F-35 as an example, but we're also well positioned on next-generation opportunities. So we can support the upgrades and enhancements to existing systems. I look at what we have in EW. We have 5 LOAs signed with international countries for F-16. Modernization is an example. We're on the Columbia class as a strategic deterrent. There's talk about next about the nuclear command and control aircraft recapitalization, which again is in our sweet spot.
So when you look across the spectrum, space, EW, cyber, ISR, resilient comms, whether we're a prime or sub, new systems, old systems, I really like where we are. So thanks for the question, Ron."

I mentioned HBTSS and SDA and some of the classified wins. They took a little longer to get under contract. Or candidly, some of these were protested, and then it caused the delays. So we just saw a slip from the fourth quarter, if you will, of 2020 into early '21. You can't get the contract, you can't get the revenue to get started. So that was just a clear slip from '20 to '21 due to timing of those. Intel and Cyber, not too lumpy of a business, but nothing to be concerned with there. In fact, when you look at that whole business, at close to $1 billion, we're seeing growth in '21 there as well."

So in a flat to declining budget environment, I think there's general speculation in your Army will be a bill payer here for us. The Army is only about 10% of our revenue. It's smaller part of what we do even with the DoD. It's, I think, between the Navy and the Air Force is about 4x what the Army happens to be. So it's not a big part of the company. I think we are more predisposed to the Air Force was our biggest customer and the Navy. We spent a lot of time talking about some of the maritime opportunities here. So we think the shift is actually favorable to us. We think we're well positioned there, and we think we can manage through those shifts happening right now between the services. So we like the positioning of our portfolio.
And by the way, in '21, we do think we can build the backlog because we'll see a book-to-bill more than 1. So we think that will continue to grow into next year.
So look, that wraps us up here today. Thank you very much. We had a strong solid year.

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter results, and I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their continued dedication and perseverance through 2020. 
Despite COVID, we met customer commitments, advanced the integration and delivered bottom line results ahead of initial expectations, all while keeping our workforce safe. We'll continue to follow mitigation plans implemented at the onset of the pandemic and keep them in place until widespread vaccinations have occurred.  
As a combined company, we're successfully executing the strategy we laid out 1.5 years ago to drive shareholder value, and our progress is reflected in our operating results and outlook. First, we delivered solid results in 2020, where we exceeded our initial guidance on margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, offsetting the negative impacts of the pandemic with a solid 7% growth on our core U.S. government business and modest growth on the international side. 
Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% from synergies and operational excellence and drove earnings per share up 13%, consistent with our double-digit growth framework. With an 8-day improvement in working capital, we also generated strong free cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion. This, along with progress on portfolio shaping, enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders and delivered growth in free cash flow per share of over 10%.  
Second, our guidance for the current year shows continued momentum in the business. With the fiscal '21 budget now set and broad program support across key areas, we're in a position to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth at the midpoint, underpinned by the building blocks we previously described. 
Our DoD portfolio is well aligned with national security priorities. And while the overall budget is flat, we expect at least low single-digit growth driven by Space, Maritime, DoD modernization and classified programs. Revenue synergies will contribute about 1 point of growth, with the notable driver being the SDA tracking layer award, as well as continued traction elsewhere with a win rate of about 2/3 of the 40 proposals awarded to date. 
On the international front, we expect another -- about another point for mid-single-digit growth plus, backed by a funded book-to-bill of above 1 in 2020 and a growing pipeline of pursuits. And then finally, in our commercial businesses, we foresee a more modest impact of full year results as we lap COVID pressures following the first quarter.  
We also expect another year of margin expansion supported by increased synergies and continued operational excellence, net of dilution from new program starts. We exited the year at $270 million in net cumulative synergy savings, $20 million ahead of our prior estimate. And with more confidence in savings from the supply chain, facility rationalization, shared services and functional efficiencies, we're now increasing our cumulative savings to $320 million to $350 million in 2021, up from a prior estimate of $300 million plus and still a year ahead of schedule.  
Our free cash flow guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion demonstrates clear progress towards our $3 billion target in 2022, with all cash use for capital returns to support double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth. Yesterday, we announced that our Board approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization, alongside a 20% increase in our dividend, the third raise since we closed, and bringing us closer to our target of a 30% to 35% payout of free cash flow.  
And then finally, we continue to position the business for long-term value creation by exiting noncore businesses and focusing our significant R&D investment on a more strategic technology-based business areas. We're now in the latter stages of several portfolio shaping processes, and we'll look to provide updates over the coming months. 
Our expectation continues to be for divestitures to represent a cumulative 8% to 10% of revenue, with about 1/3 completed to date, and all proceeds going towards repurchases. And we'll continue to sustain R&D spending at a peer high of nearly 4% of revenue with a focus on open architecture, multifunction, software defined solutions across our broad C5ISR portfolio of capabilities. 
These technologies are essential to encountering near-peer threats across all domains, and our past investments were the driver behind the recent SDA tracking layer, HBTSS and next-gen jammer wins. So overall, we're clearly making progress in building a high-performance, technology focused operating company and positioning L3Harris as a full end-to-end mission solutions prime.  
And with that, let me turn it over to you, Chris."

Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contracts for the medium unmanned surface vehicle program and a classified undersea acoustic systems program, which, alongside an important win on the U.S. Navy frigate program, affirms our strategy to establish ourselves as both a prime contractor and a systems integrator. 
This progress was offset by a moderate decline in Electro Optical due to program timing and in ISR due to aircraft timing. Our prior guidance assumed a December contract for ISR aircraft from an international customer that was delayed due to the customer's decision to expand the program. We are now awaiting parliamentary approval for that program.  
For the full year, revenue was up 3.3% from double-digit growth in Maritime and low single-digit growth in ISR. Operating income was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. And margins expanded 100 basis points to 14.3% and 230 basis points to 15.3% for the quarter and year, respectively. 
Our ISR business made significant progress on its international strategy with a contract to provide missionized ISR aircraft for the Canadian Air Force, capabilities on a maritime patrol aircraft for a customer in the Asia Pacific region and the introduction of podded SIGINT capability for unmanned aircraft for deployment in Europe and Asia. We have a strong pipeline as our allies appreciate the need for situational awareness that our systems provide.  
In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.8% for the quarter from a ramp on the F-35 as we transition from development to production on the next-generation mission systems in our Mission Avionics sector and growth in Space from new program wins. This growth was partially reduced by low single-digit decline in our Intel and Cyber due to program timing.  
For the full year, organic revenue increased 5.8% from the F-35 ramp and classified growth in Intel and Cyber. Space and Electronic Warfare were down due to in-year program transition, but recent wins position Space to be a key growth driver for 2021. Operating income was up 13% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the year, and margins expanded 150 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter and 20 basis points to 18.8% for the year. 
Overall, our Space business had a transformative year as we've been awarded contracts within the missile defense area, including the Space Development Agency's tracking layer and more recently here in January on the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor program, or HBTSS, culminating multiple years of investment in innovation. On HBTSS, our team will develop a prototype satellite that will demonstrate our capability to detect and track hypersonic weapons in space. 
The initial launch is targeted for 2023, with an opportunity to build out a constellation thereafter. These competitive wins have potential value of over $5 billion, uniquely positioning L3Harris to play a lead role with multiple agencies and mark the culmination of a successful multiyear repositioning strategy, establishing ourselves as a mission solutions prime with our responsive satellites and within missile defense.  
Next, Communications Systems organic revenue was up 3.4% for the quarter driven by tactical growth of 17% that included record international sales, up over 30% from the Mid East and Central Asia and continued DoD modernization. This strength was partially offset by anticipated weakness in our public safety business due to COVID-19 as well as a decline in Integrated Vision Systems from international program timing. Full year revenue was up 4.4%, driven by 13% growth in Tactical Communications, primarily from the ramp in DoD modernization programs, which also benefited Integrated Vision Solutions.  
As anticipated, we saw solid international growth of 4% in Tactical Communications, with major wins in Australia, Europe and the Mid East. Total communications Systems orders in Australia exceeded $200 million, with contracts for tactical radios and waveforms supporting crypto modernization requirements, and the LAND 53 next-gen night vision goggle program. The 17% decline in PSPC was consistent with expectations and should ease post the first quarter.  
Operating income was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year, and margins expanded 280 basis points to 25.9% and 200 basis points to 24.4% for the quarter and year, respectively. Our Broadband business had a major strategic win, with the prime contract award for the U.S. Navy's next-generation jammer low-band program for nearly $500 million, highlighting our advanced technology and innovative solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate in, in the future. 
The program comes with follow-on opportunities in the $4 billion range and demonstrates our standing as a leader in spectrum superiority and electronic warfare for legacy and next-gen platforms. This multiyear pursuit validates our strategy to be a prime and provide leading-edge technical solutions to our customers.  
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 11% in the quarter and 3% for the year as expected due to COVID-19-related impacts in the Commercial Aviation business. Growth with our U.S. government customers remained healthy in defense avionics from a ramp on classified programs and ground vehicle systems and mission networks from higher FAA volume. 
Operating income was down 22% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the year, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses, as cost actions and growth in defense, aviation and mission networks mitigated our commercial headwinds. Margins were flat at 14.9% in the quarter. Full year margins, however, expanded 100 basis points to 13.8%. 
Notable activity in the quarter included $142 million order from the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center to continue the development of the next-gen M-Code GPS receivers, with inception-to-date awards at over $0.5 billion.  
Over the last few months, we've successfully positioned ourselves for growth with notable awards that represent opportunities in the multibillion-dollar range. These wins provide a long-term visibility and highlight the strength of our portfolio in a range of budget environments and across multiple domains. 
With a healthy backlog of $22 billion, that's up nearly 80% for the year, adjusting for divestitures, and a funded book-to-bill of 1.04, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth. As we think about 2021, we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities that are focused on growing the top line, advancing the integration, expanding margins through flawless execution and continuous improvement, reshaping our portfolio and maximizing cash flow to support capital returns.  
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook.

I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook. 
Fourth quarter organic revenue was flat, largely driven by the effects of the pandemic and aircraft timing, as our core U.S. government business was up about 4%, with the international side up modestly. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18.5% primarily from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management. 
Earnings per share of $11.60 was better than we expected and grew 10% or $0.29, as shown on Slide 9. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.47, along with a lower share count for $0.15, which more than compensated for the headwinds from divestitures and pandemic-impacted end markets. 
For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%, with our core U.S. government business up 7% and international up 1 point, partially offset by the impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guide, with integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 13% or $1.34 primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 4% lower share count, enabling us to deliver on our double-digit growth target.  
Solid fourth quarter free cash flow of $642 million resulted in the full year coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. With this cash flow, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock and paid $725 million in dividends. 
Okay. Now switching over to the 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Starting with the top line. Organic revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5%, reflecting growth in every segment, with a light first quarter as we lap pandemic-related impacts and phase in new programs. 
On full year EBIT, we expect total company margins to be 18% to 18.5%, a 25 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint, primarily driven by increased cost synergies, operational excellence and pension, net of mix headwinds from space, IMS and tactical radios. This, combined with a 4% lower share count, will result in 2021 EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13 per share, up double digits at the midpoint versus 2020.  
On free cash flow, our guide implies nearly $14 per share at the midpoint and clear traction with our growth framework. This reflects a 3-day working capital improvement to 51 days, $375 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. 
Our guidance also reflects approximately $2.3 billion in share repurchases, excluding divestitures, as part of our recently approved buyback authorization. And following yesterday's announced dividend increase, this will be our third hike since the merger, representing a cumulative increase of about 50%, reflecting our confidence in continued cash generation. All told, we expect to return $3.1 billion to shareholders this year before accounting for any divestiture proceeds that will be additive.  
Switching over to the segments. Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6% driven by ISR aircraft missionization demand and maritime from recent wins. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 15.5% at the midpoint as operational excellence, synergy savings and pension benefits are netted by program mix impacts.  
In Space and Airborne Systems, we expect organic revenue to be up 4% to 6% driven by traction in Space and continued classified strength in Intel and Cyber. Segment operating margin of 18.5% at the midpoint is driven by mix headwinds from key growth programs that outweigh E3 productivity, pension and integration benefits.  
Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% from continued modernization growth in DoD tactical as well as international growth in Integrated Vision Solutions. Public safety will have a modest headwind in the year as COVID-related impacts lap in the first quarter of 2021, with a recovery later in the year. Segment margins are anticipated to be 24.5% at the midpoint from operational excellence and synergies, partially offset by product mix within tactical radios.  
And lastly, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% driven by continued growth in our U.S. government businesses from a ramp on combat propulsion systems and classified programs, which will be moderated by a slight decrease in commercial aerospace for the year. Segment margins of 14% at the midpoint reflect improvement driven by operational excellence, cost management and synergy savings.  
Okay. Turning to the EPS slide and bridge on Slide 11. Expected full year EPS of $12.80 at the midpoint reflects 10% growth. Of this, operations and synergies will contribute $0.44, along with a lower share count for $0.57 and pension and other items of $0.26, more than offsetting the $0.07 headwind from completed divestitures.  
All right. So just putting it all together, 2020 performance is demonstrating the resilience of our earnings and cash generating power, and the 2021 outlook reflecting further progress against our financial targets, with recurring double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth, driven by a rising top line as well as industry-leading margins and capital returns.  
Okay. One last item before getting to your questions. I know there's been interest in a deeper look into our company as well as our growth drivers. So on March 10, we'll start with a virtual business briefing focusing on 2 of our segments, Space and Airborne Systems and Integrated Mission Systems. They'll be followed by a closer look at our other businesses at a later date.  
Okay. With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions."

This is consistent with the framework we've laid out over the past 1.5 years, which is returning 100% of free cash flow to shareowners. You'll see 3.1 is a little bit in excess of that in 2021, but the framework is intact, and it's a framework we expect to continue moving forward.  
As far as the dividend, maybe being a little bit more specific, 20% were -- we've had the target, as Bill mentioned, of 30% to 35% in terms of the cash payout ratio on the dividend, and that's still our target. That's something that we'll look to accelerate or continue accelerating the dividend growth over the next few years to get ourselves in that range.

We'll see, kind of like with the last administration, some clear support there. You may see some more scrutiny in certain regions like in the Middle East, and you saw an announcement come out just a couple of days ago. 
Frankly, it wasn't necessarily new news. It was well signaled. It's sort of a standard practice at the start of a new administration to take a pause on some of these more contentious exports to certain countries, so number one. Two, we're not an arms or weapons provider, so I'm not sure it really affects us very much. When -- but when we look at sales into the region in those 2 countries, net of backlog, it's less than 1% of our revenue, so it's relatively small. 
And then third, it's likely just a matter of timing. We think if there's any impact to us at all, it's a matter of timing, and we think that will all come out within '21. So we think this will settle down relatively quickly."

It really is driven by those businesses, which we think that we can better own and drive value to owners. They tend to be ones that are more technology intensive businesses that require investment in IRAD and our 20,000-plus engineers to make them better every day to differentiate versus competitors. Those are the kinds of businesses that we want to be in, and the business we're looking to get out of noncore don't recently fit that model. 
We're making progress. We had a good start to early 2020, and COVID sort of slowed us down a little bit. We saw some acceleration in Q4. And then certainly, January has been pretty busy. 
It's not going to be a linear journey on divestitures, but we're patient, we're focused. We do still think it will be 8% to 10% of our revenue.

Look, we're a very different business today than we were 7, 8, 9 years ago when a lot of the tech com business was driven by repairs, resets. It really wasn't focused on a program of record, but that's very different today. 
So it's really stepping back. When we think about our company as a whole, we've got total backlog at the end of last year at about 1.2x of revenue. So it's a little bit less than what we see with our peers. So we're a shorter cycle, if you will, but we're not necessarily short cycle. 
We've got a piece of the business, and you hit some of the key ones that radios, night vision goggles, maybe a couple of other spots that are -- that have a backlog less than 1x of revenue. So for those businesses in particular, most of them are on programs of records today. 
They're well supported. They're in the early innings of modernization. We feel very good about that.
I'll take tactical radio for a minute on the DoD side. As we know, there's 350,000 to 400,000 radios that will be upgraded. They're about 10% of the way through there. You can see in the budget in '21 continue to be well supported in terms of revenue -- in terms of budget authority for radio monetizations, and we're in the front end of a long modernization curve on tactical radios. 
The same thing is on the international side. There's more than a dozen countries on the front end of modernization. A lot of them announced a couple hundred thousand radios, $4 billion worth of pipeline. So again, we're in the front end of modernization ramp on the international side, which, as you know, tends to follow what happens in the U.S.
And then you mentioned night vision goggles. We are on a sole-source directed requirement for ENVG-B. We delivered about 5,000 goggles to date. We're on a program of record, which was announced in September, which we're one of the awardees for that, 100,000-plus night vision goggles. So we're 5% of the way through, again with very clear budget visibility.
So when you look at where we're at of modernization and visibility into the budgets, we think the outlook is very, very positive for all of those ""shorter-cycle"" businesses, Gautam."

In 2020, at the end of 2020, we accelerated -- we continue to accelerate payments to small suppliers. Total impact, most of which was small suppliers, is about $100 million of outflow. 
I say the other piece of it was there's just a little bit of timing issue between cash taxes, and so there is some timing of cash that was more in 2020 that was paid versus what we'd originally expected. That will be a benefit in 2021. 
So those are the 2 primary drivers of 2020. 2021, we're -- as I mentioned, we're relying on 3 days of working capital. We'll also get a benefit from this cash tax a little bit better than we expected. And those are really the 2 major drivers.
And just speaking -- going back to working capital. We continue to drive. While it's 3 days, our opportunity set is substantially bigger than that. So there's runway beyond 2020, even in -- I'm sorry, 2021, even in 2021, where our projects by our sectors, by our segments are pretty well defined, particularly in inventory. And we've got a really nice, I think, a road map to deliver 2021 and beyond going forward. 
And so these -- I'd say the moving pieces are not much different from what we've talked about in the past. We're really focused on working capital to make that not a use of cash and make it either neutral or a source of cash and dropping through the net income. 2021, as I mentioned, we'll get a little bit of a tax benefit, but really kind of set the stage for continued cash flow growth beyond '21 as well."

We have good leadership there. It was lots of pieces that were well integrated together. We're not completely through all that, but we're making really good progress. 
2020 was a very strong year. It was up double digits. The orders were really strong. Book-to-bill came in above 1, in fact, reasonably above 1. 
We see continued growth in calendar '21. We're calling in a mid-single-digit range, but lots of good indicators of continued growth there. 
We just have a very solid position. We do a lot of work on power conversion, power distribution, towed arrays, mass, sonars, crypto, a bunch of different things, and we've got a great position on the unmanned side as well. So it's pretty broad-based. It's across both OE and service, U.S., international. So it's manned and unmanned. So we like the position that we happen to have.  
On the manned side, we've got good content on both Columbia and Virginia. Those programs are well supported, and Chris talked about the future frigate with Fincantieri. We've got a very strong position in content on the future frigate. Those all look really good and well supported. 
And on the unmanned side, I think we're on the front end of this. It's not a big part of the business today, but it's growing. We're the only prime of any unmanned maritime vessel here for the U.S. Navy. It's the MUSV, or the medium unmanned surface vessel, we're the prime on that. It's a pretty good contract we're executing on. 
We've got a study on the LUSV, which is the large unmanned service vehicle vessel. We're doing mine countermeasure systems. I think we talked about in the press release about a Phase 2 with -- in Europe with a partner where we're providing substantial content for unmanned mine countermeasure systems and then all the underwater side. 
Really can't talk about the -- on the classified business, but we've got a very strong position on undersea classified capabilities as well.

So we're excited about those opportunities. And as I said in my remarks, both as a system integrator or a prime, we're well positioned.

So no, we had a really good year. The team is performing very, very well. 
I talked a little bit about some of the drivers of the outperformance this year and why we took up our number next year to $320 million to $350 million, which again is well above what we thought we would do in 3 years, and we're now doing more than that in 2. 
So we're seeing a lot more opportunities in supply chain. We're still working through our facility rationalization, very, very good progress. Substantial activities happening over the course of 2021. 
It has been very, very well and closely managed and monitored. It's going to execute very well, and we're seeing good opportunities that are coming through there, functional efficiencies, shared services. 
We just keep seeing more and more opportunities to get better. That's the spirit of continuous improvement. That's really what's behind E3. That's why we think, as we wrap up integration at the back end of '21, and then in '22, we really talk about it less as integration, more is just productivity and operational excellence. 
We're going to have a good year in '21. Those are the things that drive it. So team is just executing very, very well."

We're still looking 4% to 6% the initial guidance early in the year for IMS. 
It really comes down to the number of aircraft that you can induct in the factory in any one year. So I think of it as maybe some of that 2020 slides to '21, the latter part of '21 slides into '22, if that makes sense. So we're not losing anything. It just kind of slipped out to the right.
And then on F-35 and Mission Avionics, we have multiple systems that we're providing to Lockheed, as you well know, especially on the -- what we're calling TR3, the Tech Refresh 3. So we're going through a transition from developed into production. 
We think, longer term, there's numerous opportunities for additional content that we could provide, but notwithstanding that is the aircraft's ramp-up. We get more content per plane and even the potential for sustainment. We see this as a long-term growth driver for years to come, not to mention the international opportunities on top of that."

So you laid out some of the drivers next year. Yes, we do see -- as I made that in my remarks, DoD and U.S. government, low single digits. We see revenue synergies about 1 point. We see international mid-single-digit plus, some headwinds coming from commercial. 
But you're exactly right. As you start to get out into '22 from '21, we'll see less of and maybe no commercial headwinds and maybe eventually starts to turn into a tailwind. 
We see international at the front end of a build. Again, we're very underpenetrated. We have 20% of our revenues in international. I think Chris laid out a growth target there. 
We did -- we performed very well in the back half of last year. It was up low to mid-single digits. We had a very good Q3. And we've got some good momentum coming into this year. A very big pipeline of our $67 billion total company pipeline, [ $16 billion ] of which is in international. So we've got a lot of opportunities we're chasing on the international front. 
And again, we've talked about the revenue synergies, about 1 point, call it, $150 million to $200 million net incremental in '21 from '20, we're still at the front end of the build. So we have 40 proposals that have been awarded. We won 2/3 of them, but there's 70 that are submitted. So another 30 to be awarded or not. 
There's more that are happening in the future. So we hope to continue to build on that, and we do hope -- just given the positioning of ourselves within the DoD budget, that low to single-digit growth from DoD could actually grow over time because we're in great places that are going to continue to get funded. But we're also growing as a mission solutions provider going after a larger addressable market. 
So put all those pieces together, yes, that should -- that could drive acceleration beyond '21. But right now, we're laying out the '21 framework, and we ought to be thinking about mid-single digits beyond that."

And frankly, it happened a little bit sooner than we had even anticipated at that point in time. So we were just a tad under that last year. With our guidance, we'll be at or above -- it will be above $1 billion this year. 
We're just very well positioned across the tactical radio business, as you know. We're across all the services, across all the contract vehicles. Very strong position in the Marine Corps was a big driver of us in 2020. 
We're sole-sourced on HF radios. We're sole-sourced there on Manpack. We'll compete on the handheld this year. We're sole-sourced across SOCOM. Army, we compete versus Thales and Collins. But the fact is, I think given the momentum that we have here, we see continued share gains within those areas as well within the Army. 
So I think we're well positioned. The budgets are very supportive. When you look at all tactical radio in total in '21 over '20, the budgets themselves are up about 25%. HMS is up 16%, 17%. 
So there's very good continued budget coverage here. We're starting the year with mid-single-digit growth in DoD. We're coming off a very strong '20 and an even stronger '19. 
So maybe, hopefully, there's some conservatism built into that. But there's some competition happening this year, and we'll keep evaluating and updating investors through the year on just our progress in DoD. But frankly, the team has done a great job in positioning ourselves for success in tactical over a multiyear period."

Look, I think there's going to be continued focus on the space domain, which we have spent a number of years repositioning the company to go after. 
Last year, it was a softer year. It was a transition year. We had a couple of program transitions. 
But you see in Q4, we came back very, very strongly. We're up high single digits. We'll be up high single digits in '21. 
We've got good wins. I mean, Chris walked through some of the key ones there. And frankly, that's just going to be -- continue to be a growth area. 
And you heard some of the commentary from Secretary Austin's commentary at his hearing about the focus on space and there, and it's not just across DoD. There's a lot of classified community investments going on in the space. 
So I think, number one, we've got a really good position there going from components to systems, and I think a proven strategy. I think some of the things that's happening on the unmanned side are opportunities for the future, both on maritime as well as on the airborne side. 
We've got really strong positions in both sides. I think that's going to continue to be well funded.
At the end of the day, any fight in the future, particularly against these near-peer competitors, will require network platforms and not just simply platform improvements themselves, so how they work together. That requires resilient communications. Strong, secure, non-jammable, resilient communications, and that is the sweet spot of the company. 
We keep talking about that. It's very, very important. And there's really no one that's better positioned to enable that JADC2 mission environment than where we happen to be. That's why we're on all of the ABMS contract vehicles. 
I think we've just had a great position there. That's going to continue to be well supported. So those are the areas that I think are going to be where we're best positioned. 
And I know what everyone else is talking about. We're sitting there with almost 4% of our revenue in IRAD. We're focusing our company. We've got a very unique situation with this merger where we can start off with a clean sheet and get all of our segments built from the day 1 to collaborate together, and that's why we're seeing traction here on the revenue synergies. 
So you put all those pieces together, and that's why I do believe that we've got just a strong powerful portfolio of businesses with good leadership that should outgrow our competitors into the future."

So the types of systems and the type of capabilities we have across all domains, I think, position us well. There was a question earlier about our content on F-35 as an example, but we're also well positioned on next-generation opportunities, so we can support the upgrades and enhancements to existing systems. 
I look at what we have in EW. We have 5 LOAs signed with international countries for F-16. Modernization is an example. We're on the Columbia class as a strategic deterrent. There's talk about -- next about the nuclear command and control aircraft recapitalization, which again is in our sweet spot.

So in a flat to declining budget environment, I think there's general speculation. Army will be a bill payer here for us. The Army is only about 10% of our revenue. It's smaller part of what we do even with the DoD. It's, I think, between the Navy and the Air Force, it's about 4x what the Army happens to be. 
So it's not a big part of the company. I think we are more predisposed to the Air Force was our biggest customer. And the Navy, we spent a lot of time talking about some of the maritime opportunities here.

Earlier today, we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics. Organic revenue is up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about 3 points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations. This should be the last quarter of tough comparators due to the pandemic, which our team has managed incredibly well, and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead. Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. 
Free cash flow was $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program, with a balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March. 
Before handing over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and L3Harris as CEO. It's been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees. Harris grew from a small niche defense company to a leading Mission Solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion. 
I'm especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders. The performance culture and the work environment we created is really special, and we recently were recognized for by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021 and earlier this year as a world's most admired company. 
As you know, I'll continue as exec Chair of the Board for another year, working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO. Last week, the independent directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement, indicating their confidence in mind and Chris's ability to lead this company going forward. 
The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future. I'm excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris' leadership.

We are encouraged by the continued focus on national security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments. This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains. We're watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies and international expansion, which stem from our R&D investment. In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double digits, driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and tactical radios. 
Turning to revenue synergies. We received 8 new awards, maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million. We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards across all domains that represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. On the space side, in addition to our recently highlighted HB TSS Responsive Satellite award with the missile Defense agency, our 5 decades of experience building space-based imaging systems has led to our down-select for the initial concept and design of next-generation weather imagers. This award supports Noah's future satellite system recapitalization. 
The administration's focus on climate initiatives supported by a nearly 30% FY '22 budget increase for Noah reinforces the opportunity set for L3Harris as we are a leader in weather payload and ground systems, creating an opportunity of $3 billion over the next decade. 
On the air side, we had strong orders on both new platforms such as the F-35 and legacy platforms, including the F-18 and F-16. In particular, we leveraged our experience with providing F-16 systems and our expertise in software-defined open systems architecture to secure a contract to develop the next-generation electronic warfare suite on international aircraft. We can further expand our global footprint with opportunities in more than a dozen countries in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. This adds to our recent success with the U.S. Navy's next-generation Jammer Low-Band award, for the EA-ATG grower. We're quickly establishing ourselves as a global leader in electronic warfare and aircraft survivability. We also closed on the ISR aircraft contract with the NATO customer to missionize a series of G-550s that was still pending parliamentary approval last quarter, and we continue to work on similar opportunities for other customers, which when combined with the NATO award demonstrates our ability to expand our international footprint and represents over $3 billion in potential value over the next several years. 
Moving over to the land side. We continue to make progress supporting modernization efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, including a follow-on production order under SoCom's $255 million multichannel Manpack IDIQ contract. We also received orders for our advanced radio and night vision products from Western Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, further strengthening our international leadership. 
And finally, in the C and Cyber domains, our maritime team was successful in winning 2 new prime level programs to provide imaging systems on submarines for international customers. These strategic wins highlight our ability to expand our global maritime solutions to new customers with additional follow-on opportunities to come. And while limited in what we can say due to its classified nature, our $1 billion Intel and cyber business received a follow-on order to provide end-to-end mission solutions within its ground-based adjacency franchise as we continue to deliver our [indiscernible] and our customers with challenging cyber requirements. 
These wins provide long-term visibility and support for our funded book-to-bill of 1.10 in the quarter. Our total backlog remains above $21 billion, up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures. In addition, with considerable recent bid and proposal activity, we're aggressively going after our 3-year $125 billion pipeline to deliver sustainable top line growth. 
Shifting over to margins. This quarter, we saw the healthiest results since the merger at nearly 19%, which puts us in a strong position to meet the upper end of our full year guidance. Cost synergies of $33 million, primarily attributable to supply chain and facilities consolidation, put us well on track to deliver up to $350 million of cumulative net benefits in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. 
Our E3 program also gained traction through strong program performance, factory productivity and supply chain savings, and we continue to believe that there is considerable potential beyond this year to enable another phase of cost opportunities to sustain margin expansion for L3Harris. 
Lastly, we're maximizing cash flow through continued working capital and CapEx discipline, driving shareholder-friendly capital deployment. And while we're holding off on updating our $2.3 billion share repurchase target for the year, based on our announced and potential divestitures, we still see considerable upside to the plan. 
As an update on portfolio shaping, we've recently cleared the U.S. antitrust waiting period on both the previously announced military training and combat propulsion systems divestitures and are on track to close in the second half of the year. We're progressing on other portfolio shaping opportunities, and we'll provide more details over the coming months. And to reiterate, inclusive of divestitures, we remain on track to deliver on our $3 billion free cash flow commitment in 2022, along with double-digit cash growth on a per share basis, excluding potential tax policy impacts. So we're pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities and progress we've made at the start of the year, which gives us confidence to raise the bottom end of our EPS guidance. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

First, let me begin with a brief recap of the quarter before I get into segment results. 
Organic revenue was up about 2% as growth in IMS, SAS and CS was partially offset by the expected decline in AS as due to the pandemic. Overall, our core government businesses were up 4.8% reduced by about 3 points of COVID related impacts in our commercial businesses. Margins expanded 140 basis points to 18.9%, with expansion in all 4 segments, primarily from operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management. 
We did better-than-expected in the quarter from stronger E3 and cost synergies of roughly 70 basis points as well as some timing benefits from lower R&D and program mix of approximately 50 basis points. This, along with cherry purchase activity led to earnings per share growth of 14% or $0.38 to $3.18, as shown on Slide 6. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.34, along with a lower share count, pension and interest totaling $0.23, which more than offset divested earnings and headwinds from pandemic impacted end markets. 
Free cash flow of $630 million was the result of solid net income drop-through as well as CapEx and working capital discipline, with days roughly steady at 55. And [indiscernible] returns of $909 million were comprised of $700 million in share repurchases and $209 million of dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 5.9%, with growth in all 3 businesses. Double-digit growth in maritime from a ramp unmanned platforms, including the Columbia class submarine in constellation class frigate, was complemented by growth in ISR from the NATO award carryover from last year and an electro optical from deliveries of our Westcam airborne turrets to the U.S. Army. 
Operating income was up 19%, and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence. Funded book-to-bill was impressive at over 1.3 in the quarter. 
In Space and airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.1%. From responsive programs, including SDA tracking, in HB TSS, driving high single-digit growth in space as well as growth from the F-35 platform in mission avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel and cyber. The strength was partially offset by program timing and electronic warfare. 
Operating income was up 8.6%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management including R&D timing, operational excellence and higher pension income. Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our space and electronic warfare businesses. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single-digit growth in tactical communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization. That also drove integrated vision Solutions and global communication solutions up double digits. Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments. And within public safety, due to anticipated C-O-V-I-D related impacts, they are now showing signs of stabilization. Operating income was up 12%, and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost management and integration benefits. Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter. Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training. High single-digit growth in mission networks from higher FAA volume paired with fusing and ordinates growth in defense aviation helped to offset these effects. As we move past the first quarter, we're anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow. Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% is operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing and integration benefits more than offset COVID related headwinds. Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter. 
Okay. Let's shift over to 2021 guidance. We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance, and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our top line growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter. This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts. We'll provide a more comprehensive update later in the year. In the interim, I'll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping and capital returns. On margins, a strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%. We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D, and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins. Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance, and will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength. 
On portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures net of buybacks from proceeds. And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divestiture process, which could have a modest incremental EPS impact for the year. Lastly, as highlighted at our investor briefing. We have another significant year planned for capital returns. Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion in net divestiture proceeds. So overall, for 2021, we're confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share. 
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

You're right, we did have a good quarter with double-digit growth. We had book-to-bill of $1.3 million. As I mentioned, the aircraft ISR, the tactical radios and maritime were the key drivers. Looking at our pipeline, we have about $35 billion of opportunities over the next 3 years. So really impressed with the team's work as we position ourselves for future growth. It all started with the strategy that we laid out, really a 2-part strategy: one, focusing on the mission systems and the larger programs, such as the ISR platforms we've talked about, working in tandem with our sales force, which is out there with the products. So when you look at the radios, the night vision goggles, the West Cam, the RIR turrets, it's a nice complement. So I think the diversity of our portfolio in the geography with customers in over 100 countries, really positions us well for continuing [indiscernible]. Shifting to the space question. The space business is part of SAS. I kind of look at it in 4 buckets. On the low end, we have some products, some telemetry and antennas. We do some groundwork, which I think is important to better understand the mission and to support some of these classified constellations. They tend to be mid-single-digit growth, but it's all about the SATs. Historically, we've been on the exquisite satellites as a supplier or a subcontractor, GPS III and classified SATs come to mind, but the responsive satellites is really where we've moved the needle over the last year or so and where we're optimistic in the future. So that's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio, double-digit growth for the year. We've talked about the Zeus program. We've talked about SDA tracking, HBTFF and a fair amount of classified bids that we're working on today. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of granularity and insight as to how we'll grow in space."

But the more significant kind of factor that will normalize their margins towards the balance of the year will really be related to the newer programs. As you know, we've got the Army HMS programs in the back half of the year. We also have programs like the next-gen jammer in the broadband business. And so those will likely put some pressure in the back half of the year in the margins. I'll just -- the broader comment I would say is it's a great start. Maybe this is an indication of how to think about things perhaps in the future, but we'll see a little bit of normalization here subsequent 3 quarters."

A great question, and it ties into the strategy that we've talked about. You mentioned no Mars which is an interesting opportunity. That's the no manning required chip, a recent DARPA win, which I think is pretty interesting relative to what the Navy is trying to accomplish because as you know, historically, they've taken manned ships and try to convert them into unmanned. And this is an early stage design program where we would be -- we're 1 of 3 winners, if you will, and it's really starting with a clean sheet of paper, how would you design a ship, knowing it was going to be unmanned from the beginning. So in that one, it will be interesting to see how that progresses. The follow-on will be 2022, which will probably be a prototype and in that case, we team with -- we have a variety of teammates, and we would probably team with a shipbuilder. So we're not going to be investing in a shipyard in that case. I think, generally, we're pleased with the footprint and the size our facilities. We talked about space and some of the growth, and we took some existing facilities and modify them and re-laid out the footprint to optimize the flow with new tooling and such. So we spend $1 billion a year between CapEx and IRAD. CapEx is about 2% of our revenue. I think that will drift down over time. IRAD is industry-leading at almost 4%. So the $1 billion, I think, positions us well. I do not see any increase in overhead or significant CapEx to meet our strategy. And again, most of what we're working on are the systems versus the actual platform. So it does not take up as much factory space, if you will."

On the DoD side, a couple of highlights here: the Army, HMS Manpack, recently completed the IoT last year was in the process of going through the DOT [indiscernible] e test and evaluation recently. And the good news is we just received an RFP for the full-rate production. So I think that's a great sign that the modernization is moving forward. In a month or so, the Army should be issuing its HMS leader radio RFP, again, for full-rate production. So I think that, again, is an additional positive sign. The Marines recently released an RFP for their handheld radio and the Socom business has been growing. We've been meeting milestones. And in my prepared comments, I mentioned an order there for the multichannel manpack. So it just gives you some flavor as to how the business is doing on the DoD side. Internationally, we have good visibility in Saudi. Last year, we booked $174 million order for the Ministry of National Guard. So we'll have that revenue run out. Through this year, and we're working closely with the land forces on a software-defined radio for about 5,000 initially. So that's going through the Saudi process. Europe and U.K., we had good growth. U.K., the Morpheus program is going to replace the Boman radio. So we're hoping to hear something later this year. So again, I feel pretty confident in what we've done in Australia, last year, we talked about the [indiscernible] Crypto standard upgrade and new radios for Australia. There's follow-on opportunities there. And of course, New Zealand is also a customer that we're working closely with. So kind of operationally or business development-wise, I wanted to give you some insight to what's going on, and Jay will provide you the numbers you requested."

Maybe it's going to be a longer answer than you'd like, but I think it's important to kind of calibrate everything and then I'll I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the financial implications. But you're right, I personally been involved or around F-35 for 20-some years as well as many of our senior execs. So I think that that's an important point. And we all absolutely are committed to this platform, which I think is 1 of the best aircraft in the world. So L3Harris and legacy companies, we've been a supplier for over 20 years. We have a really good track record. A few months ago, we delivered our 2 million [indiscernible] and we're at like 99.9% on-time delivery. So a lot of the work historically has been with TR2, the Tech Refresh 2 weapons release displays. But your question is specific to TR3, Tech refresh 3, which is a very complicated developmental program to meet some of the new challenges that our nation faces. So you're right, we've realized some of the risks 2 main drivers. We've realized risk that we had identified and thought could occur when we bid the program. And secondly, as it was referenced in the testimony, there have been numerous government direct changes. So those are unfortunate, but not unexpected when you're in a developmental program. We're working on 3 main products: the AMS, the Advanced Memory System; the PCD, which is the Panoramic Cockpit Display; and the ICP, which is the Integrated Core Processor. So we've been stable for the last 6 months relative to our cost. Estimates in our schedule. The AMs and PCD hardware or starting qualification and ICP is just behind that. So when you look at how important the TR3 is, it's a step change in capability. It's half the cost of the TR2 once it gets into production, and it's been designed for easier affordability and sustainment. So we're just about ready to kick off the production phase. I will say that our past financials and our current guidance reflect our performance, we don't anticipate any changes there. And then strategically, these capabilities that we're developing are going to put us in a position to leverage this technology on other products, platforms and future program. So we're excited about that, but maybe Jay can comment more specifically on the revenue and the margin implications."

And so we see this as continuing to drive growth. I think we'll update it as each year progresses. This year, as Chris mentioned, a little bit softer from a growth perspective, but we expect that to pick up next year."

Again, you look at what we're investing on the front end of the business in R&D and industry-leading amount, I said before, we did not cut R&D. We could have cut R&D and increase the margins further, but we aren't, we're taking a long-term approach. The investments we have in bid and proposal, of which we're submitting lots of proposals the R&D and direct sale expenditures have generally increased as we try to focus on the front end of the business. We talked about the revenue synergies important part of our success is the workforce. And we actually started day 1 of the merger with negative synergies as we increased the cost and the benefits to make sure our workforce was fully engaged and supported. So that's the headwinds and the items I look to give me confidence that, again, we're not looking at this short term. Quite the contrary, we're looking longer term. And we're taking an enterprise-wide approach. So we talked about shared services as an example. There's lots of companies out there. That have individual segments or sectors, doing their own processing, whether it's payables or payroll, some of this stuff isn't overly exciting, but go into a shared service concept, having single process, single systems and optimizing for the benefit of the enterprise versus individual divisions, sectors or segments is, I think, part of the strategy. And a lot of people say it, it's not easy to do, and we're doing it. So whether it's procurement, whether it's quality, E3, shared services, all those things we're looking at at an enterprise level, taking out the inefficiencies. And there's more work to do in the years ahead, and that's what gives us confidence. But Jay, do you want to maybe give more detail?"

It was the largest at as but there were benefits across the portfolio, IMS benefited about 30 basis points. CS was very small, about 10% and as about 20 basis points from pension. Overall, for the company, about 30 basis points all in. As far as the commercial businesses, PSPC was down low 20s. And the commercial aviation was down a little bit below 50%. And in the quarter. So combined, you're talking in the 30s. Sequentially, commercial aviation was slightly down from the fourth quarter. And PSPC is the same, slightly down. Some of that though is seasonality. It's not -- I don't think the compares that creates on a sequential basis. It's better, I think, year-over-year. Fourth quarter, I think, is seasonably higher in both businesses. I'll just chime in, George. Relative to PSPC, I'm sure you're seeing the $1.9 billion COVID bill has about $360 billion for state and local municipalities. And the states have full discretion, don't have to spend that money. So I think that's going to give us more confidence in the PSPC recovery. Most of which, as you know, is with states and local municipalities. So I'm sure they're going to be trying to figure out between education, healthcare and public safety, how to spend that money, but I think just in the first quarter, we tripled the number of proposals that we submitted. So I have confidence the second half of the year we'll start to see the recovery that Jay mentioned. And I think we're all familiar with what's going on in commercial aviation. So again, that's back-end loaded as well."

So the volume will also play into that. And part of the E3 methodology and the focus on operational excellence is really taking space and making it more of a factory type concept and mindset and we have those capabilities. We do it in other parts of the company, and we're sharing those best practices. So each and every one of those will contribute. 
So thank you for that final question, Michael. Let me just wrap it up.

Earlier today, we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics. Organic revenue is up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about 3 points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations. This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic, which our team has managed incredibly well, and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead. Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9%, resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. 
Free cash flow was $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program, with a balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March. 
Before handing over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and L3Harris as CEO. It's been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees. Harris grew from a small, niche, defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion. 
I'm especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders. The performance culture and the work environment we created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021 and earlier this year as a world's most admired company. 
As you know, I'll continue as exec Chair of the Board for another year, working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO. Last week, the independent directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement, indicating their confidence and mind in Chris' ability to lead this company going forward. 
The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future. And I'm excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris' leadership. 
So with that, Chris, let me turn it over to you."

Well, thank you, Bill, and I appreciate your and the Board's vote of confidence and look forward to our continued partnership in your new role. As you heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us. 
The strategic priorities we develop together, as shown on Slide 3, are the foundations on which we'll deliver sustainable top line growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns. All areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter. 
In terms of the top line, our Q1 results, coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22, about 1.5 points versus FY '21, reinforces our optimism for growth. 
We are encouraged by the continued focus on National Security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments. This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains. We're watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies and international expansion, which stem from our R&D investment. In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double digits, driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and Tactical radios. 
Turning to revenue synergies. We received 8 new awards, maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million. We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards across all domains that represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. On the space side, in addition to our recently highlighted HBTSS Responsive Satellite award with the Missile Defense Agency, our 5 decades of experience building space-based imaging systems has led to our down-select for the initial concept and design of next-generation weather imagers. This award supports NOAAs future satellite system recapitalization. 
The administration's focus on climate initiatives, supported by a nearly 30% FY '22 budget increase for NOAA, reinforces the opportunity set for L3Harris as we are a leader in weather payload and ground systems, creating an opportunity of $3 billion over the next decade. 
On the air side, we had strong orders on both new platforms such as the F-35 and legacy platforms, including the F-18 and F-16. In particular, we leveraged our experience with providing F-16 systems and our expertise in software-defined open systems architecture to secure a contract to develop the next-generation electronic warfare suite on international aircraft. 
We can further expand our global footprint with opportunities in more than a dozen countries in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. This adds to our recent success with the U.S. Navy's Next Generation Jammer Low-Band award, for the EA-18G Growler. We're quickly establishing ourselves as a global leader in electronic warfare and aircraft survivability. 
We also closed on the ISR aircraft contract with the NATO customer to missionize a series of G-550s that was still pending parliamentary approval last quarter, and we continue to work on similar opportunities for other customers, which when combined with the NATO award demonstrates our ability to expand our international footprint and represents over $3 billion in potential value over the next several years. 
Moving over to the land side. We continue to make progress supporting modernization efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, including a follow-on production order under SOCOM's $255 million multichannel manpack IDIQ contract. We also received orders for our advanced radio and night vision products from Western Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, further strengthening our international leadership. 
And finally, in the sea and cyber domains, our maritime team was successful in winning 2 new prime level programs to provide imaging systems on submarines for international customers. These strategic wins highlight our ability to expand our global maritime solutions to new customers with additional follow-on opportunities to come. And while limited in what we can say due to its classified nature, our $1 billion intel and cyber business received a follow-on order to provide end-to-end mission solutions within its ground-based adjacency franchise as we continue to deliver against our customers most challenging cyber requirements. 
These wins provide long-term visibility and support for our funded book-to-bill of 1.10 in the quarter. Our total backlog remains above $21 billion, up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures. In addition, with considerable recent bid and proposal activity, we're aggressively going after our 3-year $125 billion pipeline to deliver sustainable top line growth. 
Shifting over to margins. This quarter, we saw the healthiest results since the merger at nearly 19%, which puts us in a strong position to meet the upper end of our full year guidance. Cost synergies of $33 million, primarily attributable to supply chain and facilities consolidation, put us well on track to deliver up to $350 million of cumulative net benefits in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. 
Our E3 program also gained traction through strong program performance, factory productivity and supply chain savings, and we continue to believe that there is considerable potential beyond this year to enable another phase of cost opportunities to sustain margin expansion for L3Harris. 
Lastly, we're maximizing cash flow through continued working capital and CapEx discipline, driving shareholder-friendly capital deployment. And while we're holding off on updating our $2.3 billion share repurchase target for the year based on our announced and potential divestitures, we still see considerable upside to the plan. 
As an update on portfolio shaping, we've recently cleared the U.S. antitrust waiting period on both the previously announced military training and combat propulsion systems divestitures and are on track to close in the second half of the year. We're progressing on other portfolio shaping opportunities, and we'll provide more details over the coming months. And to reiterate, inclusive of divestitures, we remain on track to deliver on our $3 billion free cash flow commitment in 2022, along with double-digit cash growth on a per share basis, excluding potential tax policy impacts. So we're pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities and progress we've made at the start of the year, which gives us confidence to raise the bottom end of our EPS guidance. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

First, let me begin with a brief recap of the quarter before I get into segment results. 
Organic revenue was up about 2% as growth in IMS, SAS and CS was partially offset by the expected decline in AS due to the pandemic. Overall, our core government businesses were up 4.8% reduced by about 3 points of COVID-related impacts in our commercial businesses. Margins expanded 140 basis points to 18.9%, with expansion in all 4 segments, primarily from operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management. 
We did better-than-expected in the quarter from stronger E3 and cost synergies of roughly 70 basis points as well as some timing benefits from lower R&D and program mix of approximately 50 basis points. This, along with share repurchase activity led to earnings per share growth of 14% or $0.38 to $3.18, as shown on Slide 6. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.34, along with a lower share count, pension and interest totaling $0.23, which more than offset divested earnings and headwinds from pandemic-impacted end markets. 
Free cash flow of $630 million was the result of solid net income drop-through as well as CapEx and working capital discipline, with days roughly steady at 55. And shareholder returns of $909 million were comprised of $700 million in share repurchases and $209 million of dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 5.9%, with growth in all 3 businesses. Double-digit growth in maritime from a ramp on manned platforms, including the Columbia class submarine in Constellation-class Frigate, was complemented by growth in ISR from the NATO award carryover from last year and an Electro Optical from deliveries of our WESCAM airborne turrets to the U.S. Army. 
Operating income was up 19%, and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence. Funded book-to-bill was impressive at over 1.3 in the quarter. 
In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.1%. From responsive programs, including SDA tracking in HBTSS, driving high single-digit growth in space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in mission avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel and cyber. The strength was partially offset by program timing and electronic warfare. 
Operating income was up 8.6%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management including R&D timing, operational excellence and higher pension income. Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic Warfare businesses. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single-digit growth in Tactical Communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization. That also drove integrated vision solutions and global communication solutions up double digits. 
Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments. And within public safety, due to anticipated COVID-related impacts, they are now showing signs of stabilization. 
Operating income was up 12%, and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost of management and integration benefits. Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter. Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID-related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training. 
High single-digit growth in mission networks from higher FAA volume paired with fusing and ordinates growth in defense aviation helped to offset these effects. As we move past the first quarter, we're anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow. Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% is operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing and integration benefits more than offset COVID-related headwinds. Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter. 
Okay. Let's shift over to 2021 guidance. We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance, and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our top line growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter. This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts. We'll provide a more comprehensive update later in the year. 
In the interim, I'll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping and capital returns. On margins, this strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%. We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D, and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins. Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance, and will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength. 
On portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures net of buybacks from proceeds. And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divestiture process, which could have a modest incremental EPS impact for the year. Lastly, as highlighted at our investor briefing. We have another significant year planned for capital returns. Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion in net divestiture proceeds. So overall, for 2021, we're confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share. 
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

You're right, we did have a good quarter with double-digit growth. We had book-to-bill of 1.3. As I mentioned, the aircraft ISR, the Tactical radios and maritime were the key drivers. 
Looking at our pipeline, we have about $35 billion of opportunities over the next 3 years. So really impressed with the team's work as we position ourselves for future growth. It all started with the strategy that we laid out, really a 2-part strategy: one, focusing on the mission systems and the larger programs, such as the ISR platforms. We've talked about, working in tandem with our sales force, which is out there with the products. So when you look at the radios, the night vision goggles, the WESCAM EO/IR turrets, it's a nice complement. So I think the diversity of our portfolio and the geography with customers in over 100 countries, really positions us well for continued growth. 
Shifting to the space question. The space business is part of SAS. I kind of look at it in 4 buckets. On the low end, we have some products, some telemetry and antennas. We do some groundwork, which I think is important to better understand the mission and to support some of these classified constellations. 
They tend to be mid-single-digit growth, but it's all about the SATs. Historically, we've been on the exquisite satellites as a supplier or a subcontractor, GPS III and classified SATs come to mind, but the responsive satellites is really where we've moved the needle over the last year or so and where we're optimistic in the future. So that's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio, double-digit growth for the year. 
We've talked about the Zeus program. We've talked about SDA tracking, HBTSS and a fair amount of classified bids that we're working on today. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of granularity and insight as to how we'll grow in space."

As you know, we've got the army HMS programs in the back half of the year. We also have programs like the Next-Gen Jammer in the broadband business. And so those will likely put some pressure in the back half of the year in the margins. I'll just -- the broader comment I would say is, it's a great start. Maybe this is an indication of how to think about things perhaps in the future, but we'll see a little bit of normalization here in the subsequent 3 quarters."

I mean, do you need to increase overhead and your footprint to support new customers, does CapEx increase to support manufacturing of new platforms. Does the focus of the R&D spend need to shift a bit?

A great, great question, and it ties into the strategy that we've talked about. You mentioned NOMARS which is an interesting opportunity. That's the No Manning Required Ship, a recent DARPA win, which I think is pretty interesting relative to what the Navy is trying to accomplish because as you know, historically, they've taken manned ships and try to convert them into unmanned. And this is an early stage design program where we would be -- we're 1 of 3 winners, if you will, and it's really starting with a clean sheet of paper, how would you design a ship, knowing it was going to be unmanned from the beginning. 
So in that one, it will be interesting to see how that progresses. The follow-on will be 2022, which will probably be a prototype and in that case, we team with -- we have a variety of teammates, and we would probably team with a shipbuilder. So we're not going to be investing in a shipyard in that case. I think, generally, we're pleased with the footprint and the size our facilities. We talked about space and some of the growth, and we took some existing facilities and modify them and re-laid out the footprint to optimize the flow with new tooling and such. 
So we spend $1 billion a year between CapEx and IRAD. CapEx is about 2% of our revenue. I think that will drift down over time. IRAD is industry-leading at almost 4%. So the $1 billion, I think, positions us well. I do not see any increase in overhead or significant CapEx to meet our strategy. And again, most of what we're working on are the systems versus the actual platform. So it does not take up as much factory space, if you will."

We do track our win rates at the company level. And you don't necessarily -- if they're too high, it suggests that we haven't opened the aperture and been as aggressive as we would like. So we track those on a segment and an overall basis and $125 billion over 3 years. If we are successful in at least 50%, that easily tracks to our mid-single-digit growth targets.

Seth, let me first start with some of the accomplishments we've had in Tactical radios, then I'll ladle the ball to Jay to give you the specific numbers. And we're off to a very good start in 2021, as you saw in the press release. On the DoD side, a couple of highlights here: the army, HMS Manpack, recently completed the IoT last year was in the process of going through the [ DOT and E ] test and evaluation recently. And the good news is we just received an RFP for the full-rate production. 
So I think that's a great sign that the modernization is moving forward. In a month or so, the Army should be issuing its HMS leader radio RFP, again, for full-rate production. So I think that, again, is an additional positive sign. The Marines recently released an RFP for their handheld radio and the SOCOM business has been growing. We've been meeting milestones. And in my prepared comments, I mentioned an order there for the multichannel manpack. So it just gives you some flavor as to how the business is doing on the DoD side. 
Internationally, we have good visibility in Saudi. Last year, we booked $174 million order for the Ministry of National Guard. So we'll have that revenue run out. Through this year, and we're working closely with the land forces on a software-defined radio for about 5,000 initially. So that's going through the Saudi process. 
Europe and U.K., we had good growth. U.K., the Morpheus program is going to replace the Bowman radio. So we're hoping to hear something later this year. So again, I feel pretty confident in what we've done. In Australia, last year, we talked about the del SIC, crypto standard upgrade in new radios for Australia. There's follow-on opportunities there.

But you're right, I personally been involved or around F-35 for 20-some years as well as many of our senior execs. So I think that that's an important point. And we all absolutely are committed to this platform, which I think is 1 of the best aircraft in the world. So L3Harris and legacy companies, we've been a supplier for over 20 years. We have a really good track record. A few months ago, we delivered our 2 million [indiscernible] and we're at like 99.9% on-time delivery. 
So a lot of the work historically has been with TR2, the Tech Refresh 2 weapons release displays. But your question is specific to TR3, Tech refresh 3, which is a very complicated developmental program to meet some of the new challenges that our nation faces. So you're right, we've realized some of the risks 2 main drivers. We've realized risk that we had identified and thought could occur when we bid the program. 
And secondly, as it was referenced in the testimony, there have been numerous government direct changes. So those are unfortunate, but not unexpected when you're in a developmental program. We're working on 3 main products: the AMS, the Advanced Memory System; the PCD, which is the Panoramic Cockpit Display; and the ICP, which is the Integrated Core Processor. So we've been stable for the last 6 months relative to our cost. Estimates in our schedule. The AMS and PCD hardware or starting qualification and ICP is just behind that. 
So when you look at how important the TR3 is, it's a step change in capability. It's half the cost of the TR2 once it gets into production, and it's been designed for easier affordability and sustainment. So we're just about ready to kick off the production phase. I will say that our past financials and our current guidance reflect our performance, we don't anticipate any changes there. And then strategically, these capabilities that we're developing are going to put us in a position to leverage this technology on other products, platforms and future program. So we're excited about that, but maybe Jay can comment more specifically on the revenue and the margin implications."

Well one way, I know we're not cutting and I think I said this back in the March meeting. Again, you look at what we're investing on the front end of the business in R&D and industry-leading amount, I said before, we did not cut R&D. We could have cut R&D and increase the margins further, but we aren't, we're taking a long-term approach. The investments we have in bid and proposal, of which we're submitting lots of proposals the R&D and direct sale expenditures have generally increased as we try to focus on the front end of the business. 
We talked about the revenue synergies important part of our success is the workforce. And we actually started day 1 of the merger with negative synergies as we increased the cost and the benefits to make sure our workforce was fully engaged and supported. So that's the headwinds and the items I look to give me confidence that, again, we're not looking at this short term. Quite the contrary, we're looking longer term. 
And we're taking an enterprise-wide approach. So we talked about shared services as an example. There's lots of companies out there. That have individual segments or sectors, doing their own processing, whether it's payables or payroll, some of this stuff isn't overly exciting, but go into a shared service concept, having single process, single systems and optimizing for the benefit of the enterprise versus individual divisions, sectors or segments is, I think, part of the strategy. And a lot of people say it, it's not easy to do, and we're doing it. 
So whether it's procurement, whether it's quality, E3, shared services, all those things we're looking at at an enterprise level, taking out the inefficiencies. And there's more work to do in the years ahead, and that's what gives us confidence. But Jay, do you want to maybe give more detail?"

Just a specific example in our ISR businesses in terms of people as you would expect, it'd be all over an aircraft teardown and rebuild, it's simple things like changing the tooling so that you get a benefit in ergonomics as well as an hours reduction or minutes reduction in the rebuild of a particular aircraft. And so we've been able to take tooling, in some cases, it's customer-funded tooling on top of it, where we're able to change our processes, improve them and take costs out at the same time. So it's not a -- let's just slash cost and hopefully it's fixed. These are more systemic type reductions that we have an organization built around to drive continuous improvement and sustainable reductions."

No, we apply E3, not only to the fixed-price contracts, but to cost plus.

So they move into full-rate production. And then, of course, fair amount have potential for international export. 
So we look at it as a portfolio and in a natural healthy growing business, you are going to have the headwind mix from the development programs, which we'll take every day of the week. But the rest of the portfolio is continuing to mature through its cycle. And as I mentioned, F-35 is a good example. We're getting through the TR3 and then we'll be starting production, and that program should have a lot of legs as an example. 
EW is part of SAS. That's how we've had good success of late, as I mentioned, with the F-16 as a specific example. We have legacy programs on the F-18. I don't talk a whole lot about the cyber business, but that's growing. And again, there's a commercial model aspect to our cyber business that allows us to have licensing and other opportunities to grow margins. So that's pretty much how I look at it.

I'd like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company.We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenge",1631,"Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company.
We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenges such as the pandemic. The high-performance culture and leadership team we've created are set to carry this momentum forward, which is elected in today's results.
We reported a strong second quarter. Organic revenue was up over 6%, with growth across our key end markets and all 4 business segments. Funded book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date. Margins increased to 18.6%, resulting in EPS of $3.26, up 15%. We had solid free cash flow of $685 million, which contributed to shareholder returns above $1 billion, including repurchases of $850 million in the quarter and over $1.5 billion year-to-date.
Our first half performance, coupled with our expectations for continued execution in the back half, more than offset the divestiture headwinds and supports another raise to our EPS guidance, which Jay will cover. Execution against our strategic priorities, that are on Slide 3, continue to deliver results and create value for the company's stakeholders as we make progress and build momentum with top line opportunities, operational performance, announcing and closing divestitures and delivering on our capital return commitments.
In terms of the top line, we had our best quarter since the start of the pandemic, with progress against our key end market growth objectives, while seeing data points that validate our focused R&D strategy. Our government businesses were up 6% in the second quarter, driven by double-digit growth internationally. Our international revenue benefited from increased aircraft ISR and radio sales to regions in the Asia Pacific and Europe.
And on the domestic front, the growth was broad-based with our responsive space and maritime programs as well as land modernization for night vision and SATCOM products leading the way. Our strategy to deliver end-to-end mission solutions utilizing the capabilities and scale across the broader organization continues to gain momentum. Our space business strategy is working as we grew 10% in the quarter, capturing classified awards totaling over $300 million for ground and responsive satellite solutions. These awards are also part of the revenue synergy capture efforts and bring awards to date to over $700 million on a win rate of 70% from our growing $7 billion-plus pipeline.
Turning to our Commercial Aerospace and Public Safety businesses, they were up over 5% in aggregate and were led by our Commercial Aerospace business up double digits off a low base and from strength in product sales. On the Public Safety side, there was a modest decline, but with sequential improvement and increased bid and proposal activity from a more stable backdrop.
Our solid top line was accompanied by backlog growth as we continue to win strategic programs that includes several prime roles. Backlog increased 7% organically year-over-year to over $20 billion, with notable award activity across all domains.
On the space side, our revenue synergy awards came from combining electronics and optics capabilities across the company to deliver solutions for an increasingly contested environment. These are incremental to the pathfinder programs we previously won, which have billions of dollars of potential over time. Customers are viewing L3Harris as a trusted disruptor. They see us as a company that understands the complexity of the mission and can offer fresh and creative solutions. With a 3-year space pipeline of nearly $20 billion, there's more opportunity for continued growth.
Within the air domain, we strengthened our existing F-35 franchise with initial production awards for the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit under the TR3 program. This brings total orders year-to-date on the platform to about $500 million. We're progressing on all 3 TR3 systems through integration and qualification this year, and in support of the planned lot 15 cut in of the production hardware. We are also secured a roughly $100 million IDIQ with SOCOM for infrared EO sensors on rotary platforms furthering our modernization opportunities across L3Harris.
Moving over to the land side. We signed several key contracts that touch both international and domestic markets. First, we received a $3.3 billion 5-year IDIQ for foreign military sales to a range of partner countries from our new broader portfolio of products, including radios and SATCOM terminals. This replaces our prior 5-year $1.7 billion contract, which supports and validates the continued modernization across geographies and expands our product scope.
Second, in the U.K., we received a logistic support contract covering legacy Bowman and future Morpheus radios, positioning us well for a $1 billion modernization opportunity in that country.
And third, we won a competitive 10-year IDIQ to supply the U.S. Air Force with our T7 multi-mission robots, further expanding our customer reach. After launching the T7 with the U.K. a few years back, we're now pursuing other international opportunities in the robotic area.
Within the C domain, our team was successful in extending its leading prime position in undersea sensor systems and warfare training for a range of the U.S. Navy platforms and support of distributed maritime operations. This undersea warfare training range program, called U.S. litter, has an award value of nearly $400 million and further builds our credibility to pursue additional domestic international opportunities.
In the cyber domain, while limited to what we can say due to the classified nature, our $1 billion Intel & Cyber business received over 250 million in orders for complex mission solutions and specialized communications for both domestic and international markets, leading to another quarter of book-to-bill above 1.0 for this business. We also had a key award in an adjacent market with our Public Safety business with a 15-year $450 million contract from the state of Florida to upgrade and continue operating its law enforcement system for first responders.
Moving over to the budgets. While the process is ongoing and we await a fight up, we were pleased with the initial request for the FY '22 budget as a support stability in the DoD, NASA and FAA spending and is aligned with our capabilities and investment priorities.
For the DoD, it's focused on continuing to revolve around and address near-peer threats through high-value technology, which Congress is revealing. And when we look at the portfolio and the relevant line items, our programs are well supported. This builds on the trend we've seen in international markets where there's a broad stability in military spending, including key countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada, Japan, amongst others. We're also seeing growing demand for the type of defensive systems we offer for our alignment with the U.S. export policies to ensure partner security. Our most significant opportunities remain for ISR aircraft missionization and other upgrades, land force modernization and enhanced maritime systems. All in all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to outgrow the budget and deliver reasonable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion that drive a large pipeline of opportunities underpinned by our leading R&D investments.
Shifting to operational performance. We continue to surpass milestones for priority programs. For example, at SAS, the team completed a successful preliminary design review for an advanced EW solution called Viper Shield that can deliver self-protection capability for Block 70 F-16s. At IMS, we advanced our unmanned maritime strategy with several customer engagements and demonstrations, highlighting differentiators in predictive autonomy on USVs as well as a submerged torpedo tube launch and recovery for our small UUVs. We also successfully completed a prototype demonstration for SOCOM multi-role aircraft in a variety of challenging conditions, while utilizing the breadth of L3Harris offerings.
And financially, we had another quarter of strong margins as the team continues to offset mix impacts from early-stage programs with 3 key initiatives, including program excellence and factory productivity, allowing us to flow through cost synergies totaling an incremental $27 million in the quarter. In addition, the first half synergy run rate is now $350 million, driven by progress on facilities, consolidation and IT efficiencies. We see this as the minimum level we'll deliver on this year, up from the $320 million to $350 million range we discussed in April and still a year ahead of schedule. Any upside from here will be incorporated in our E3 program, with our integration blending into operational excellence initiatives. On margins for the year, this leaves us at about 18.5% for the top end of the prior guide and a level we'll look to build on in the years ahead.
Next, on capital allocation. Today, we announced the sale of 2 small businesses within our Aviation Systems segment for $185 million in cash, and these should close before year-end. When combined with the roughly $2.5 billion divested under our portfolio shaping initiative, total gross proceeds are set to be $2.7 billion. We have now divested nearly 10% of our revenues. And with the completion of a few others in process, our portfolio shaping program announced in 2019 is largely complete.
Proceeds from divestitures, including those from the recently completed military training and combat propulsion businesses, will be part of our capital returns program consistent with our shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.4 billion this year, up versus our prior guide of $2.3 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.2 billion in 2021.
So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, confident in our ability to consistently deliver double-digit EPS and double-digit free cash flow per share growth, and I'm excited about the next phase for L3Harris.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

Organic revenue was up 6.2%, with a return to growth i",1254,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll provide more color on the quarter. I'll cover also the segment results and finish with our updated outlook.
Starting with the second quarter. Organic revenue was up 6.2%, with a return to growth in all 4 segments. IMS led the way up 12%, followed by a return to growth at AS of 4.7%. Margins expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%, primarily from E3 productivity, program performance and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D. The sequential decline in margin was also due to timing of R&D as expected. These drivers, along with our share repurchases, led to EPS being up 15% or $0.43 to $3.26, as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth, volume, synergies and operations contributed $0.18, a lower share count contributed another $0.18 and pension, tax and interest accounted for the remaining $0.07.
Free cash flow was $685 million, while working capital days stood at 57 due to receivables timing. And shareholder returns of over $1 billion were comprised of $850 million in share repurchases and $207 million in dividends. Of note, our last 12 months of share repurchases have totaled over $3 billion at an average price of $195 per share, well below our current share price.
Now turning to the quarterly segment results on Slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 12%, led by double-digit growth in ISR aircraft missionization on a recently awarded NATO program. In addition to mid-single-digit growth in Maritime from a ramp on key platforms, including the Virginia-class submarine and constellation class frigate. This more than offset the low single-digit decline in our Electro Optical business that was due to the timing of WESCAM turret deliveries, which we expect to increase in the back half.
Operating income was up 2%, while margins contracted 150 basis points to 15.3%, reflecting expected mix impacts, including a ramp on growth platforms and programs. Pointed book-to-bill was 0.81 in the quarter and 1.06 for the first half with strength across the segment.
In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 3.2% from our missile defense and other responsive programs, driving 10% growth in space, along with mid-single-digit classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This strength outweighed the impact from modernization program transitions in our airborne businesses, the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 program within Mission Avionics and F-16 Viper Shield advanced electronic warfare system.
Operating income was up 7.7%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7% as operational excellence, including program performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was over 1 for both the quarter and first half, driven by space.
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.2% with mid-single-digit growth in Tactical Communications that included international up double digits, driven primarily by modernization demand from Asia Pacific and Europe and an anticipated decline in DoD from last year's second quarter 40%-plus growth. USD -- U.S. DoD modernization continued to benefit the integrated vision and global communication businesses, leading to high single-digit and double-digit growth, respectively. Conversely, broadband was down low single digits on lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments, as expected. And public safety was down 7% from residual pandemic-related impacts.
Operating income was up 8.3% and margins expanded 170 basis points to 25.5% from higher volume, operational excellence and integration benefits. And funded book-to-bill in the quarter and first half were about 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 4.7%, driven primarily by our commercial aerospace business that was up 20% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. We also saw mid-single-digit growth in defense aviation from a ramp on fusing inornate programs and emission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.5% from operational excellence, integration benefits and higher volume. Funded book-to-bill was about 0.9 for the quarter and first half.
Okay. Shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Overall, organic revenue growth is unchanged at 3% to 5%, with our top line trending as expected at 4% for the first half and supported by a 1.05 funded book-to-bill year-to-date. Our U.S. government businesses are expected to accelerate in the back half, driven by space, tactical communications, integrated vision solutions and classified growth within Intel & Cyber and defense aviation.
On the international side, we continue to expect mid-single-digit plus growth for the year as a strong first half, led by aircraft ISR and international tactical radios, moderates. And lastly, the encouraging results in our commercial businesses in the second quarter build confidence in a flattish outlook for the year, with double-digit growth in the back half.
Consistent with our overall guidance at the consolidated level, we've also maintained our segment sales guide as well. And as we think about the second half of the year, our key watch items will be the timing of awards, the continued performance of our supply chain and the pace of the commercial recovery.
Turning to margins. We have raised our outlook to approximately 18.5%, a 25 basis point increase to the top end of the previous range due to our strong performance to date and confidence in our ability to execute on cost synergies, E3 and program deliverables. We do continue to expect margins to move lower in the back half due to higher R&D investment and stronger growth on new earlier-stage programs.
From a segment perspective, we're holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board, but we're expecting IMS and SAS to be at the upper end of their ranges, given their strong performance to date and are holding AS and CS steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at AS and expected mix pressure at CS.
On EPS, we're raising our full year guide to a range of $12.80 to $13, with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11% growth from 2020, delivering on our double-digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures. As shown on Slide 11, the increase of $0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and $0.19 from a lower share count at 203 million shares, along with a lower tax rate of about 16%, all of which more than offset divested earnings of $0.31. On a stand-alone basis, we expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures.
Moving to free cash flow. Our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion is intact despite divestiture-related headwinds are roughly $80 million. It continues to reflect the 3-day working capital improvement from year-end to around 49 and 50 days. That's now adjusted for divestitures. CapEx is expected to be about $365 million, $10 million lower versus the prior guide due to completed divestitures.
Our guidance also now reflects approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $1.1 billion from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. All told, we expect to return about $4.2 billion to shareholders this year.
So let me sum it all up. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and first half, solid revenue and book-to-bill growth, further expansion of industry-leading margins and consistent cash generation and deployment, all enabling another guide raise as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and drive double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

So I think what we're seeing is some upward pressure for revenue growth and margins over the longer term, like we've talked about before. We had a great quarter when you look at the book-to-bill and the continuation for modernization of the land forces, whether it's the radios, the night vision goggles, SATCOM, we're really in a good position.

Doug, if you recall, if you look at the future, it's somewhat similar to what we had this year. If you look at our segments, we had SAS at 4 to 6,  IMS at 4 to 6,  and now it's followed by CS and AS. If you look to the future, we would expect the 2 -- those 2 top segments to continue to be the leaders in growth.
I will say, as Chris mentioned, that this gives us more confidence in the CS outlook, but we probably expect those 2 to drive a little bit higher growth than CS in the medium term. On the margin profile, you see this year, we are taking, from the first half, we are going back a little bit, and that's really a reflection of the mix on the new programs. We have the Army, the HMS monetization programs. We also have in our broadband communication, the next-gen JAMA program. So we have some pretty sizable programs that are actually margin dilutive.
The good thing about that is the team has a track record of being able to take cost out, drive the margins better over time. So if you look at the first half, it shows you what the potential of the segment could be. And so when we end the year this year, we'll be in that, say, 24 -- but now we're saying 24.5% at the midpoint. We delivered over 25% in the first half of the year. That gives you kind of a view of what the medium term could look like over time."

So that's something that we're quite proud of, and we've also moved into the missile defense arena.
So maybe a little longer answer. The approach we're taking in space is similar to what we've done in all 5 domains, and it's really understanding the customers' mission. We have 47,000 employees and 20,000 engineers and 20,000 employees with clearances. So we're looking at our capabilities. We're looking at how we're spending our IRAD. We're trying to develop solutions and alternatives that meet their needs. 
We've talked a lot in the past, as you know, about our responsive sets where we were able to develop and launch satellites within 20 months. So that's helping us win a lot of these prime positions. We understand the mission. We have innovative solutions. The focus is on the payload and the integration and speed. So strategically, I think that has been a needle mover.
When I look at the exquisite satellites, we continue to have some of the best payloads out there. So we're working with partners, usually, the larger primes, and that's contributed to some success, and we have some awards coming up in the next few months that are classified.
And then we're working collaboratively with some of these new entrants, just like we do with the traditional primes and find where we can partner, where we can compete and it seems to be working. So very proud of that team and the outlook is quite positive in space, and the budget is clearly supporting this growth as well."

The pension, if you think about this year, all in between FAS and CAS benefit of about $470 million on an absolute basis. We expect that next year, the CAS element to decline a little bit as a result of the ARPU legislation or if it was enacted earlier in the year that pushed out funding requirements for pension our recovery for CAS will come down a little bit. But that should be offset by some fast income. So net-net, I would expect the year-over-year pension to be pretty much flat."

No, we've had numerous transactions that comprise the $2.7 billion. I went back and looked at our original estimates, and we've generally to answer your question, been able to meet or, in some cases, slightly exceed what we had projected. 
We talked way back about maybe about $2.8 billion of gross proceeds from all these divestitures, we're at 2.7. And as I mentioned, a couple of small ones. So we'll will clearly get within the range of our expectations.
On the M&A front, we did come out of the box 2 years ago and said we really were going to stand down on M&A and focus on the integration and the divestitures. And as I've highlighted, that's gone very well or maybe even better than expected. But even during that 2-year period, we watched the market. I'm highly confident we didn't miss anything in that 2-year period.
So we'll continue to survey the market. We're looking at anything that is a ""must-have"" as we call it. And when I look at the portfolio, as we've said over the 2 years, we're in all 5 domains. I don't really see any glaring needs or gaps. So we'll either proactively approach companies or respond to inbound calls, but we're really going to continue to hold the discipline, look at things strategically, look at them operationally, make sure the financial hurdles make sense. So not really in a rush and very pleased with what we've been able to win organically. So hopefully, that gives you some insight. Robert. And we'll let you know as things progress."

Yes, I mean I try to encourage my team that we got to spend time with our customers, listen to their challenges and such. So actually, this evening, I'll be headed to D.C. and have 3 days of meetings in the Pentagon with a whole variety of customers from OST in the services and obviously bringing the key P&L leaders with me. So we like to listen to our customers and see how we can help them and work collaboratively with them on the budget process and such. So I think everybody does it, but that's something I'm focused on.
International, we came out of the chute and said, this was one of the areas we thought we could do better. And I think we said we were underperforming as a combined company, and we were probably right around 19% of our revenue maybe 20% on a pro forma basis back in 29 -- or 2019. So far this year, we're at about 22% of our revenue coming from international. So we're seeing a little positive movement, as you know, is a little lumpy.
As I mentioned, maybe somewhat surprising, the budgets have really been stable across the globe, consistent with the U.S. So I think I think that was a pleasant surprise, given the threat environment, when you think of U.K., Australia, Japan, Canada.
And so our approach and strategy that I've talked about is really twofold. We have the 10 focus countries where we have executives, either local country nationals or expats there day-to-day understanding the process, the threats and bringing in our P&L leaders, at least when the borders open to try to close on deals. So that seems to be working well. 
And then more on the traditional product side, we use the distributors and the reps, and we've been able to use previous relationships to expand the portfolio. I mentioned that IDIQ for FMS, as an example, that now allows all the products of the new company to come through, not just the traditional radio. So I think that's a positive.
A lot of what we do is focused on more defensive systems. We're hearing from our international customers. is ultimately, they want situational awareness and the ability to communicate in a contested environment. So I look at our portfolio and the things we're doing on ISR aircraft, whether it's something like a river joint to a business jet and in some cases, to a single prop aircraft. We have a broad portfolio that allows them to get situational awareness. We've talked quite about -- a bit about our resilient comms capability, our waveforms library, which is second to none. And relative to the regions, it's the usual place, the Mid East, the Far East and Asia Pacific, and we're seeing growth opportunities in all those areas. So that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but we're optimistic, and I think we're in a good position and executing on the strategy we laid out 2 years ago."

If you look at tactical communications, we see a lot of these foreign countries following the same DoD modernization path. And so we see opportunities there. And I'd say the other area is maritime, both in manned and unmanned requests for support in the capabilities that we provide, both, in say, electrical distribution and power control as well as things like autonomy. And so we just continue to see a growing pipeline there. We're pretty comfortable with our growth objective over the medium term."

Gautam, I think overall, probably in both cases, both DoD and international, you're looking at probably low to mid-single-digit growth over the medium term. Part of the reason, particularly in DoD, is that while we have strong growth on the modernization programs, it does cannibalize a piece of our base business. And so you have a little bit of a reduction there with growth -- solid growth on the monetization programs, army being the largest program that's really in the early innings. And we've got the start of full rate production here coming in the back half of this year. 
Internationally, Chris mentioned that before. There's a demand around the world for some significant upgrades as far as modernization. And -- but again, I would put the growth rate right now in that low to mid-single digit. As new countries come on, other countries fall off. And so obviously, we're going to drive that to more of a mid-single digit. But for now, I think that's the best way to think about it and look at it."

And our focus is clearly to deliver, which our team has done a great job on schedule and meet all of our commitments.
I think ultimately, there's going to be a question of how these get split. I think there are several hundred thousand devices needed and they have slightly different capabilities and mission sets. So I would think over time there's going to be a split between the 2. We've been talking a little more publicly about some of the augmented reality capabilities within the EMV GB, the real focus on the night vision capabilities. So different capabilities, different mission. And I would think that 2 converge at some point, and we'll see how the Army wants to play that out.

We did see some good recovery, double digit in the second quarter, driven a little more by the products and the actual training. I think there's a slight lag there. We have a variety training models from academies where the cadets actually come into our facilities for an 18 -- 12- to 18-month period. That's been a little challenged due to some of the border closures. So that's a little lagging. I think as the borders open up, we'll see an uptick there. Of course, the Delta virus has kind of thrown a curve ball in everything compared to what we thought it would be. So the recovery is lagging a little bit.
The simulators, as you said, is a pilot shortage, people we need to get the training refreshed or a lot of pilots may have retired, and there's now going to be some new pilots that are going to need the simulator training. And then, of course, for the actual manufacturing, we had a slow start to the year, as you would expect, not a lot of people buying simulators.
But so far, in the third quarter, even though it's early August, we've already been awarded 2 simulators and we'll be converting those to contracts here in the next 30 to 45 days.

So going back to December of 2020 when we put out our guidance for '21, pretty good visibility, 70%. There's maybe 10-ish or so of follow-on. So to answer your question, I guess you could say maybe 15%, maybe 20% at most is revenue derived from new business to give you some idea on the -- driven by new programs or new contracts is kind of how I look at it.
And as you suggest, some of those, especially the -- with the DoD start out as cost plus contracts, then migrate into low rate production and full rate production. So it's no secret that the cost-plus margins tend to be lower than what we're currently realizing. So it's dilutive on that front. And then even on the fixed price contracts, I think we're generally pretty conservative in how we start booking those until we retire and mitigate risk. So maybe that answers your question there.
As far as competitive pricing pressures, nothing new or different than what we've had over the last decade or 2 in this industry. The selection criteria varies by program. And I think our customers are very sophisticated and they look at the technical solutions. They look at past performance. They look at the management team. They look at cost. They look at schedule.

I mentioned 2 of those 3, we were successful in getting a production contract, which I think is indicative of the progress we've made.
Where we are right now is going through the safety of flight on these 3 products. One has completed the test. One is just about to start later this week, and the third starts in October. So it's all per schedule. We're committed and focused on making sure we're ready for the Lot 15 cut in. That's a big focus of both Lockheed and the J.P. And I'd say over the last 6 months, the teams have made a lot of good progress. We're communicating. We understand the schedule. We understand the risk. So I feel good about our piece of the great program and contributing to Lockheed and allowing them to deliver their jets. 
So as usual, in any development program, there's directed change, there's government dependencies and stuff that we're used to and accustomed to and manage and work around. So I'd say probably feel better about the program now than I did in April."

The 2 businesses -- the multiple businesses that we divested at the end of the quarter were about $800 million of combined sales. So half year, about $400 million impact for the second half, and that's what's driving the reported sales to come down by that amount.
On the working capital, it's also a good observation. We reset again with the impact of these divestitures, George. So at the end of the second quarter, on an adjusted basis, we're at 57 days, and we're trying to get now to around 50-ish days. Part of this was planned where we had some program deliverables in the first half of the year, and those receivables will turn into billings and collections in the back half of the year. We also had in the second quarter, just high receivable balance, with the timing of sales. And so that will just normalize. We'll collect that cash here in the third quarter.
And really, for us, the working capital reduction is the same as it's always been, really for the year. It's really driving down the inventory. Two elements, as I mentioned, one is just delivering on our key program milestones, so we can turn those into billings and into collections. And then second element is really delivering on our working capital initiatives. And these are the things that we've been talking about as far as reduced cycle time, improving our forecasting process. So a big second half for us, but it's essentially the way we had planned it, and we believe that we're on track for that. And I'd say that at the end of the year, George, is really kind of 49 to 50 days on this new adjusted basis, taking out these divestitures."

We look at award fee scores. We look to earn value management.

I'd like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company.
We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenges such as the pandemic. The high-performance culture and leadership team we've created are set to carry this momentum forward, which is elected in today's results.
We reported a strong second quarter. Organic revenue was up over 6%, with growth across our key end markets and all 4 business segments. Funded book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date. Margins increased to 18.6%, resulting in EPS of $3.26, up 15%. We had solid free cash flow of $685 million, which contributed to shareholder returns above $1 billion, including repurchases of $850 million in the quarter and over $1.5 billion year-to-date.
Our first half performance, coupled with our expectations for continued execution in the back half, more than offset the divestiture headwinds and supports another raise to our EPS guidance, which Jay will cover. Execution against our strategic priorities, that are on Slide 3, continue to deliver results and create value for the company's stakeholders as we make progress and build momentum with top line opportunities, operational performance, announcing and closing divestitures and delivering on our capital return commitments.
In terms of the top line, we had our best quarter since the start of the pandemic, with progress against our key end market growth objectives, while seeing data points that validate our focused R&D strategy. Our government businesses were up 6% in the second quarter, driven by double-digit growth internationally. Our international revenue benefited from increased aircraft ISR and radio sales to regions in the Asia Pacific and Europe.
And on the domestic front, the growth was broad-based with our responsive space and maritime programs as well as land modernization for night vision and SATCOM products leading the way. Our strategy to deliver end-to-end mission solutions utilizing the capabilities and scale across the broader organization continues to gain momentum. Our space business strategy is working as we grew 10% in the quarter, capturing classified awards totaling over $300 million for ground and responsive satellite solutions. These awards are also part of the revenue synergy capture efforts and bring awards to date to over $700 million on a win rate of 70% from our growing $7 billion-plus pipeline.
Turning to our Commercial Aerospace and Public Safety businesses, they were up over 5% in aggregate and were led by our Commercial Aerospace business up double digits off a low base and from strength in product sales. On the Public Safety side, there was a modest decline, but with sequential improvement and increased bid and proposal activity from a more stable backdrop.
Our solid top line was accompanied by backlog growth as we continue to win strategic programs that includes several prime roles. Backlog increased 7% organically year-over-year to over $20 billion, with notable award activity across all domains.
On the space side, our revenue synergy awards came from combining electronics and optics capabilities across the company to deliver solutions for an increasingly contested environment. These are incremental to the pathfinder programs we previously won, which have billions of dollars of potential over time. Customers are viewing L3Harris as a trusted disruptor. They see us as a company that understands the complexity of the mission and can offer fresh and creative solutions. With a 3-year space pipeline of nearly $20 billion, there's more opportunity for continued growth.
Within the air domain, we strengthened our existing F-35 franchise with initial production awards for the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit under the TR3 program. This brings total orders year-to-date on the platform to about $500 million. We're progressing on all 3 TR3 systems through integration and qualification this year, and in support of the planned lot 15 cut in of the production hardware. We are also secured a roughly $100 million IDIQ with SOCOM for infrared EO sensors on rotary platforms furthering our modernization opportunities across L3Harris.
Moving over to the land side. We signed several key contracts that touch both international and domestic markets. First, we received a $3.3 billion 5-year IDIQ for foreign military sales to a range of partner countries from our new broader portfolio of products, including radios and SATCOM terminals. This replaces our prior 5-year $1.7 billion contract, which supports and validates the continued modernization across geographies and expands our product scope.
Second, in the U.K., we received a logistic support contract covering legacy Bowman and future Morpheus radios, positioning us well for a $1 billion modernization opportunity in that country.
And third, we won a competitive 10-year IDIQ to supply the U.S. Air Force with our T7 multi-mission robots, further expanding our customer reach. After launching the T7 with the U.K. a few years back, we're now pursuing other international opportunities in the robotic area.
Within the C domain, our team was successful in extending its leading prime position in undersea sensor systems and warfare training for a range of the U.S. Navy platforms and support of distributed maritime operations. This undersea warfare training range program, called U.S. litter, has an award value of nearly $400 million and further builds our credibility to pursue additional domestic international opportunities.
In the cyber domain, while limited to what we can say due to the classified nature, our $1 billion Intel & Cyber business received over 250 million in orders for complex mission solutions and specialized communications for both domestic and international markets, leading to another quarter of book-to-bill above 1.0 for this business. We also had a key award in an adjacent market with our Public Safety business with a 15-year $450 million contract from the state of Florida to upgrade and continue operating its law enforcement system for first responders.
Moving over to the budgets. While the process is ongoing and we await a fight up, we were pleased with the initial request for the FY '22 budget as a support stability in the DoD, NASA and FAA spending and is aligned with our capabilities and investment priorities.
For the DoD, it's focused on continuing to revolve around and address near-peer threats through high-value technology, which Congress is revealing. And when we look at the portfolio and the relevant line items, our programs are well supported. This builds on the trend we've seen in international markets where there's a broad stability in military spending, including key countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada, Japan, amongst others. We're also seeing growing demand for the type of defensive systems we offer for our alignment with the U.S. export policies to ensure partner security. Our most significant opportunities remain for ISR aircraft missionization and other upgrades, land force modernization and enhanced maritime systems. All in all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to outgrow the budget and deliver reasonable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion that drive a large pipeline of opportunities underpinned by our leading R&D investments.
Shifting to operational performance. We continue to surpass milestones for priority programs. For example, at SAS, the team completed a successful preliminary design review for an advanced EW solution called Viper Shield that can deliver self-protection capability for Block 70 F-16s. At IMS, we advanced our unmanned maritime strategy with several customer engagements and demonstrations, highlighting differentiators in predictive autonomy on USVs as well as a submerged Torpedo tube launch and recovery for our small UUVs. We also successfully completed a prototype demonstration for SOCOM multi-role aircraft in a variety of challenging conditions, while utilizing the breadth of L3Harris offerings.
And financially, we had another quarter of strong margins as the team continues to offset mix impacts from early-stage programs with 3 key initiatives, including program excellence and factory productivity, allowing us to flow through cost synergies totaling an incremental $27 million in the quarter. In addition, the first half synergy run rate is now $350 million, driven by progress on facilities, consolidation and IT efficiencies. We see this as the minimum level we'll deliver on this year, up from the $320 million to $350 million range we discussed in April and still a year ahead of schedule. Any upside from here will be incorporated in our E3 program, with our integration blending into operational excellence initiatives. On margins for the year, this leaves us at about 18.5% for the top end of the prior guide and a level we'll look to build on in the years ahead.
Next, on capital allocation. Today, we announced the sale of 2 small businesses within our Aviation Systems segment for $185 million in cash, and these should close before year-end. When combined with the roughly $2.5 billion divested under our portfolio shaping initiative, total gross proceeds are set to be $2.7 billion. We have now divested nearly 10% of our revenues. And with the completion of a few others in process, our portfolio shaping program announced in 2019 is largely complete.
Proceeds from divestitures, including those from the recently completed military training and combat propulsion businesses, will be part of our capital returns program consistent with our shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.4 billion this year, up versus our prior guide of $2.3 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.2 billion in 2021.
So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, confident in our ability to consistently deliver double-digit EPS and double-digit free cash flow per share growth, and I'm excited about the next phase for L3Harris.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

I'll cover also the segment results and finish with our updated outlook.
Starting with the second quarter. Organic revenue was up 6.2%, with a return to growth in all 4 segments. IMS led the way up 12%, followed by a return to growth at AS of 4.7%. Margins expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%, primarily from E3 productivity, program performance and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D. The sequential decline in margin was also due to timing of R&D as expected. These drivers, along with our share repurchases, led to EPS being up 15% or $0.43 to $3.26, as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth, volume, synergies and operations contributed $0.18, a lower share count contributed another $0.18 and pension, tax and interest accounted for the remaining $0.07.
Free cash flow was $685 million, while working capital days stood at 57 due to receivables timing. And shareholder returns of over $1 billion were comprised of $850 million in share repurchases and $207 million in dividends. Of note, our last 12 months of share repurchases have totaled over $3 billion at an average price of $195 per share, well below our current share price.
Now turning to the quarterly segment results on Slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 12%, led by double-digit growth in ISR aircraft missionization on a recently awarded NATO program. In addition to mid-single-digit growth in Maritime from a ramp on key platforms, including the Virginia-class submarine and constellation class frigate. This more than offset the low single-digit decline in our Electro Optical business that was due to the timing of WESCAM turret deliveries, which we expect to increase in the back half.
Operating income was up 2%, while margins contracted 150 basis points to 15.3%, reflecting expected mix impacts, including a ramp on growth platforms and programs. Pointed book-to-bill was 0.81 in the quarter and 1.06 for the first half with strength across the segment.
In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 3.2% from our missile defense and other responsive programs, driving 10% growth in space, along with mid-single-digit classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This strength outweighed the impact from modernization program transitions in our airborne businesses, the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 program within Mission Avionics and F-16 Viper Shield advanced electronic warfare system.
Operating income was up 7.7%, and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7% as operational excellence, including program performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was over 1 for both the quarter and first half, driven by space.
Next, Communication Systems' organic revenue was up 3.2% with mid-single-digit growth in Tactical Communications that included international up double digits, driven primarily by modernization demand from Asia Pacific and Europe and an anticipated decline in DoD from last year's second quarter 40%-plus growth. USD -- U.S. DoD modernization continued to benefit the integrated vision and global communication businesses, leading to high single-digit and double-digit growth, respectively. Conversely, broadband was down low single digits on lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments, as expected. And public safety was down 7% from residual pandemic-related impacts.
Operating income was up 8.3% and margins expanded 170 basis points to 25.5% from higher volume, operational excellence and integration benefits. And funded book-to-bill in the quarter and first half were about 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 4.7%, driven primarily by our commercial aerospace business that was up 20% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. We also saw mid-single-digit growth in Defense Aviation from a ramp on fusing inornate programs and emission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.5% from operational excellence, integration benefits and higher volume. Funded book-to-bill was about 0.9 for the quarter and first half.
Okay. Shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Overall, organic revenue growth is unchanged at 3% to 5%, with our top line trending as expected at 4% for the first half and supported by a 1.05 funded book-to-bill year-to-date. Our U.S. government businesses are expected to accelerate in the back half, driven by space, tactical communications, integrated vision solutions and classified growth within Intel & Cyber and Defense Aviation.
On the international side, we continue to expect mid-single-digit plus growth for the year as a strong first half, led by aircraft ISR and international tactical radios, moderates. And lastly, the encouraging results in our commercial businesses in the second quarter build confidence in a flattish outlook for the year, with double-digit growth in the back half.
Consistent with our overall guidance at the consolidated level, we've also maintained our segment sales guide as well. And as we think about the second half of the year, our key watch items will be the timing of awards, the continued performance of our supply chain and the pace of the commercial recovery.
Turning to margins. We have raised our outlook to approximately 18.5%, a 25 basis point increase to the top end of the previous range, due to our strong performance to date and confidence in our ability to execute on cost synergies, E3 and program deliverables. We do continue to expect margins to move lower in the back half due to higher R&D investment and stronger growth on new earlier-stage programs.
From a segment perspective, we're holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board, but we're expecting IMS and SAS to be at the upper end of their ranges, given their strong performance to date and are holding AS and CS steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at AS and expected mix pressure at CS.
On EPS, we're raising our full year guide to a range of $12.80 to $13, with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11% growth from 2020, delivering on our double-digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures. As shown on Slide 11, the increase of $0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and $0.19 from a lower share count at 203 million shares, along with a lower tax rate of about 16%, all of which more than offset divested earnings of $0.31. On a stand-alone basis, we expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures.
Moving to free cash flow. Our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion is intact, despite divestiture-related headwinds are roughly $80 million. It continues to reflect the 3-day working capital improvement from year-end to around 49 and 50 days. That's now adjusted for divestitures. CapEx is expected to be about $365 million, $10 million lower versus the prior guide due to completed divestitures.
Our guidance also now reflects approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $1.1 billion from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. All told, we expect to return about $4.2 billion to shareholders this year.
So let me sum it all up. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and first half, solid revenue and book-to-bill growth, further expansion of industry-leading margins and consistent cash generation and deployment, all enabling another guide raise as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and drive double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

And is there a potential to take margins up above their current 25% levels here?"

So I think what we're seeing is some upward pressure for revenue growth and margins over the longer term, like we've talked about before. We had a great quarter when you look at the book-to-bill and the continuation for modernization of the land forces, whether it's the radios, the night vision goggles, SATCOM, we're really in a good position.

If you look to the future, we would expect the 2 -- those 2 top segments to continue to be the leaders in growth.
I will say, as Chris mentioned, that this gives us more confidence in the CS outlook, but we probably expect those 2 to drive a little bit higher growth than CS in the medium term. On the margin profile, you see this year, we are taking, from the first half, we are going back a little bit, and that's really a reflection of the mix on the new programs. We have the Army -- the HMS monetization programs. We also have in our broadband communication, the next-gen JAMA program. So we have some pretty sizable programs that are actually margin dilutive.
The good thing about that is the team has a track record of being able to take cost out, drive the margins better over time. So if you look at the first half, it shows you what the potential of the segment could be. And so when we end the year this year, we'll be in that, say, 24 -- but right now, we're saying 24.5% at the midpoint. We delivered over 25% in the first half of the year. That gives you kind of a view of what the medium term could look like over time."

So that's something that we're quite proud of, and we've also moved into the missile defense arena.
So maybe a little longer answer. The approach we're taking in space is similar to what we've done in all 5 domains, and it's really understanding the customers' mission. We have 47,000 employees and 20,000 engineers and 20,000 employees with clearances. So we're looking at our capabilities. We're looking at how we're spending our IRAD. We're trying to develop solutions and alternatives that meet their needs. 
We've talked a lot in the past, as you know, about our responsive sats where we were able to develop and launch satellites within 20 months. So that's helping us win a lot of these prime positions. We understand the mission, we have innovative solutions. The focus is on the payload and the integration and speed. So strategically, I think that has been a needle mover.
When I look at the exquisite satellites, we continue to have some of the best payloads out there. So we're working with partners, usually, the larger primes, and that's contributed to some success, and we have some awards coming up in the next few months that are classified.
And then we're working collaboratively with some of these new entrants, just like we do with the traditional primes and find where we can partner, where we can compete and it seems to be working. So very proud of that team and the outlook is quite positive in space, and the budget is clearly supporting this growth as well."

As Chris mentioned, E3 is the key driver. It's going to drive us, and we talked about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the medium term of being able to continue to drive expansion, and we feel pretty confident in that. The pension, if you think about this year, all-in, between FAS and CAS benefit of about $470 million on an absolute basis. We expect that next year, the CAS element to decline a little bit as a result of the ARPA legislation or if it was enacted earlier in the year that pushed out funding requirements for pension, our recovery for CAS will come down a little bit. But that should be offset by some FAS income so net-net, I would expect the year-over-year pension to be pretty much flat."

So we'll will clearly get that within the range of our expectations.
On the M&A front, we did come out of the box 2 years ago and said we really were going to stand down on M&A and focus on the integration and the divestitures.

I'm highly confident we didn't miss anything in that 2-year period.

So actually, this evening, I'll be headed to D.C. and have 3 days of meetings in the Pentagon with a whole variety of customers from OST in the services and obviously, bringing the key P&L leaders with me. So we like to listen to our customers and see how we can help them and work collaboratively with them on the budget process and such. So I think everybody does it, but that's something I'm focused on.
International, we came out of the chute and said, this was one of the areas we thought we could do better. And I think we said we were underperforming as a combined company, and we were probably right around 19% of our revenue, maybe 20% on a pro forma basis back in 29 -- or 2019. So far this year, we're at about 22% of our revenue coming from international. So we're seeing a little, little positive movement, as you know, is a little lumpy. As I mentioned, maybe somewhat surprising, the budgets have really been stable across the globe, consistent with the U.S. So I think that was a pleasant surprise, given the threat environment, when you think of U.K., Australia, Japan, Canada.
And so our approach and strategy that I've talked about is really twofold. We have the 10-focus countries where we have executives, either local country nationals or expats there day-to-day understanding the process, the threats and bringing in our P&L leaders, at least, when the borders open to try to close on deals. So that seems to be working well. 
And then more on the traditional product side, we use the distributors and the reps, and we've been able to use previous relationships to expand the portfolio. I mentioned that IDIQ for FMS, as an example, that now allows all the products of the new company to come through, not just the traditional radio. So I think that's a positive.
A lot of what we do is focused on more defensive systems. We're hearing from our international customers. It's ultimately, they want situational awareness and the ability to communicate in a contested environment. So I look at our portfolio and the things we're doing on ISR aircraft, whether it's something like a river joint to a business jet and in some cases, to a single prop aircraft. We have a broad portfolio that allows them to get situational awareness. We've talked quite about -- a bit about our resilient comms capability, our waveforms library, which is second to none. And relative to the regions, it's the usual place, the Mid East, the Far East and Asia Pacific, and we're seeing growth opportunities in all those areas. So that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but we're optimistic, and I think we're in a good position and executing on the strategy we laid out 2 years ago."

The ISR aircraft dimensionization, if you recall back in our March investor briefing, we've talked about taking the exquisite Rivet Joint capability, bringing that to business jets is also bringing it to pod capability based on customer affordability, and there's a significant amount of demand around the world for that.
If you look at Tactical Communications, we see a lot of these foreign countries following the same DoD modernization path. And so we see opportunities there. And I'd say the other area is maritime, both in manned and unmanned requests for support in the capabilities that we provide, both, in say, electrical distribution and power control as well as things like autonomy.

Gautam, I think overall, probably in both cases, both DoD and international, you're looking at probably low to mid-single-digit growth over the medium term. Part of the reason, particularly in DoD, is that while we have strong growth on the modernization programs, it does cannibalize a piece of our base business. And so you have a little bit of a reduction there with growth -- solid growth on the monetization programs, Army being the largest program that's really in the early innings. And we've got the start of full rate production here coming in the back half of this year. 
Internationally, Chris mentioned that before. There's a demand around the world for some significant upgrades as far as modernization. And -- but again, I would put the growth rate right now in that low to mid-single digit. As new countries come on, other countries fall off. And so obviously, we're going to drive that to more of a mid-single digit. But for now, I think that's the best way to think about it and look at it."

And our focus is clearly to deliver, which our team has done a great job on schedule and meet all of our commitments. I think ultimately, there's going to be a question of how these get split. I think there are several hundred thousand devices needed and they have a slightly different capabilities and mission sets. So I would think over time, there's going to be a split between the 2. We've been talking a little more publicly about some of the augmented reality capabilities within the ENVG-B, the real focus on the night vision capabilities. So different capabilities, different mission. And I would think that 2 converge at some point, and we'll see how the Army wants to play that out.

We did see some good recovery, double digit in the second quarter, driven a little more by the products and the actual training. I think there's a slight lag there. We have a variety of training models from academies where the cadets actually come into our facilities for an 18 -- 12- to 18-month period. That's been a little challenged due to some of the border closures. So that's a little lagging. I think as the borders open up, we'll see an uptick there. Of course, the Delta virus has kind of thrown a curve ball in everything compared to what we thought it would be. So the recovery is lagging a little bit.
The simulators, as you said, is a pilot shortage. People we need to get the training refreshed or a lot of pilots may have retired, and there's now going to be some new pilots that are going to need the simulator training. And then, of course, for the actual manufacturing, we had a slow start to the year, as you would expect, not a lot of people buying simulators. But so far, in the third quarter, even though it's early August, we've already been awarded 2 simulators and we'll be converting those to contracts here in the next 30 to 45 days. So we are seeing an uptick, and it's going to drive growth in the second half. We're assuming -- I'll have Jay give the exact numbers, double-digit growth in commercial aviation. So it is a good market. It's got good technology, and we're going to continue to run that business and evaluate and determine strategically what we want to do with it.

And we're also seeing it in the simulator training. As Chris mentioned, the one thing to keep an eye on it for us, just more maybe company-specific, is that we do operate our simulator training in these regions that have been a little bit mixed as far as lockdowns opens up and lock back down. And so -- but that's the smallest piece of our business. Overall, we're pretty confident with this 30% growth based on what we're seeing."

When I look at -- as we go through the planning process and build up our annual operating plan, we start the year, and we usually have pretty good visibility into what's already in backlog. So a lot of -- it's kind of in the 70% range as we look forward. So going back to December of 2020 when we put out our guidance for '21, a pretty good visibility, 70%. There's maybe 10-ish or so of follow-on. So to answer your question, I guess you could say maybe 15%, maybe 20% at most is revenue derived from new business to give you some idea on the -- driven by new programs or new contracts is kind of how I look at it.
And as you suggest, some of those, especially the -- with the DoD start out as cost plus contracts, then migrate into low rate production and full rate production. So it's no secret that the cost-plus margins tend to be lower than what we're currently realizing. So it's dilutive on that front. And then even on the fixed price contracts, I think we're generally pretty conservative in how we start booking those until we retire and mitigate that risk. So maybe that answers your question there. As far as competitive pricing pressures, nothing new or different than what we've had over the last decade or 2 in this industry. The selection criteria varies by program. And I think our customers are very sophisticated and they look at the technical solutions. They look at past performance. They look at the management team. They look at cost. They look at schedule. So they're taking all those things into consideration. And like I said earlier to an earlier question, we try to find ways to work collaboratively with these new entrants when and if they can add value and increase our probability of win.

The 2 businesses -- the multiple businesses that we divested at the end of the quarter were about $800 million of combined sales. So half year, about $400 million impact for the second half, and that's what's driving the reported sales to come down by that amount.
On the working capital, it's also a good observation. We reset again with the impact of these divestitures, George. So at the end of the second quarter, on an adjusted basis, we're at 57 days, and we're trying to get now to around 50-ish days. Part of this was planned where we had some program deliverables in the first half of the year, and those receivables will turn into billings and collections in the back half of the year. We also had in the second quarter, just high receivable balance, with the timing of sales. And so that will just normalize. We'll collect that cash here in the third quarter.
And really, for us, the working capital reduction is the same as it's always been, really for the year. It's really driving down the inventory. Two elements, as I mentioned, one is just delivering on our key program milestones, so we can turn those into billings and into collections. And then second element is really delivering on our working capital initiatives. And these are the things that we've been talking about as far as reduced cycle time, improving our forecasting process. So a big second half for us, but it's essentially the way we had planned it, and we believe that we're on track for that.

We look at award fee scores. We look to earn value management.
So when you look at all those things holistically, each and every one contributes to our cash flow and our profitability.

In recent months, shortages of electronic",1968,"Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. Absent such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry best market position for radios. And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front, we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double digit on both accounts. 
Shifting over to the third quarter. Following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CS and an ISR aircraft award at IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07, and we delivered record high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21, up 13% versus the prior year, with solid free cash flow of $673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in the quarter. Our execution against the company's strategic priorities have been a key factor in value creation for all stakeholders in spite of the pandemic. And we made progress in the quarter by advancing top line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping and returning capital to our owners. 
Starting with the top line. The revenue decline in the quarter fell short of our internal targets largely due to 2 timing factors. At CS, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics-focused businesses, notably tactical communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue. And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow. And all told, we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CS. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings nor our win rates and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over 1x. 
In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full-rate production contract with the U.S. Army. Second, at IMS, we had a follow-on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 point shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I've been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. 
Within the space domain, on the classified side, we continued to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the intel community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion. And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review and the development of the missile tracking satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. 
Moving to the air domain. Key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft. On the B-52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition, on the international front, we were awarded an initial $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE, with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our RSR capabilities that range from turboprops, to business jets, to large aircraft. 
And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities. Under the Army HMS program, we received over $200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full-rate production awards out of a multibillion-dollar IDIQ and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also won a majority share on the second program of record for the EMV GV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field-ready goggles. So we were 3 for 3 on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. 
Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation class frigate, with follow-on awards for the next shipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several hundred million dollar opportunity for L3Harris. 
We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One, to provide electro-optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another within international ally, highlighting our superior undersea sensor capabilities. Both could expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered Power Conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class Block V upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbia class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. 
We also had a key award within our Mission Networks business. We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity and strengthens L3Harris' long-standing relationship with Australia. 
Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a Mid East customer to provide modernized software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channel synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios. When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to date totaled roughly $900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. With a pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top line growth. 
These wins supported another strong quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.07 and 1.06x year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion or up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. 
Shifting over to the outlook for budgets. We're pleased with the progress made on the FY '22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR. The plus ups from the HASC, SAP and SACD, along with steadiness from HACD, combined with recent global events, provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions, which we're focused on providing. 
All in all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of $100 billion. 
Pivoting to margin performance. Our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another $15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures. This program is one of our key discriminators. 
And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First, is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out cost. A great example is a pilot program in our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year rollout ahead of us. 
The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence and supply chain. On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. 
On supply chain, a global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the company and are temporary in nature. The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers or leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place, with further opportunities in the years ahead. 
Moving over to the portfolio. We put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the electron devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses within AS for a combined $130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation. Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. 
Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. 
In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1%, lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays and ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CS were down 3% and 5%, respectively, and absent these impacts would have been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business, while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in commercial aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6%, with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance and cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal expectations by more than 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering on E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs and retirement of risk. 
These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20. And pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08. That more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays. 
Free cash flow was $673 million, and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. This supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion, comprised of $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3%, driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth, for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our Maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation class frigate and classified programs. 
Operating income was up 4%, and margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, with strength across the segment. 
In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 program within Mission Avionics as well as program timing in electronic warfare and Intel and Cyber. We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. 
Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in space. And funded book-to-bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other space awards. 
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was down 5%, due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stem from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8 point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations, as well as lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments. In addition, the Integrated Vision and Global Communications Solutions businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs, respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double digits versus the prior year and sequentially and strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System award in the prior quarter. 
Operating income decreased 1%, and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios and integration benefits that outweigh supply chain impacts and higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and Integrated Vision for modernization alongside key state-level awards within public safety. 
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 1%. By commercial aerospace business, that was up over 40% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish sales in Mission Networks as well as lower fusing and ordinate systems volume due to contract roll-offs along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.4% as expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery and integration benefits more than offset divestiture-related headwinds. And funded book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date. 
Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2%, with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays. At a segment level, we've maintained our sales guides, but for CS, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5% versus our prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within Tactical Communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single digits. 
For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft, while SAS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within space and Intel and Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to award timing slipping to the fourth quarter within our classified business. 
By end market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid- to high single digits on average. 
Turning to margins. We've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to date, E3 progress and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays, along with mix effects on new earlier-stage programs, but still strong progress for the full year. 
From a segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint, delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. 
As shown on Slide 11, the midpoint is now at $12.93. That's $0.55 from improvement in operations and other items, including the release of contingencies, offset by additional divested earnings of about $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays. As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. 
Moving to free cash flow. Our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture headwinds and now supply chain delays of over $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3- to 5-day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And CapEx is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures. 
Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. Net of these puts and takes, we're in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double digits in 2021. 
Okay. Let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound, and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft missionization, DoD and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future. 
As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall will be recovered by the end of next year, and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates and tax rules. 
Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic-related headwinds for a seventh straight quarter and delivered strong bottom line performance and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. 
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

And I think you said it right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably 3 years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note that I want to go back and reinforce. And one was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses and, after the merger, how we're well positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment, which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China, China, China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think, puts us in a good position to support the war fighter. Our cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. Like what we've done in the air domain, while there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. 
And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well positioned in all these domains. And I think you see that reflected in our results and what we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. 
The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come. So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago and have talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well positioned with the DoD in all domains. We have a great revenue synergy opportunity and process. And our international growth has been a bright spot over the last couple of years. So as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall company coming in, in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. 
We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the $800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay?"

And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I t",889,"Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well as far as broad growth across the portfolio. 
I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4 to 6 we said that will be probably towards the upper end of this year. And we see a lot of the same going into '22 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower for us on the back of international aircraft missionization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual throughput related to missionization in the aircraft. You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, I talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of missionization. So that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver low to mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. 
On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards of electrooptical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that. That would be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low to mid-single-digit next year. 
And the final business within IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the past, really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation class frigate. We've won some awards in class on the classified, undersea sensors. And we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime, and we expect that to deliver, frankly, mid- to high single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well positioned to do a low to mid-single digit, if not more. 
When you look at Space and Airborne Systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid- to high single digits growth there. Same thing with Intel & Cyber. We continue to see growth in demand in the classified areas in both of those businesses. That will be tempered a bit our airborne businesses. We've seen this year that the transition, particularly mission avionics on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year as well as some -- program transition -- transitions on the -- in electronic warfare, particularly in the F-16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward very easily being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. 
I'll go next to maybe AS and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry. We continue to expect traffic growth next year, and we expect that business to grow in line with that. So you can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. 
Mission Networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award. That will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And then our Defense Aviation is seeing a little bit of the delays related to award timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver, the segment can deliver low to mid-single-digit growth. 
And then finally, CS. We've talked about tac comm, the supply chain pressures there. This year, that business will be down about 10%. And we see if you think about tac comm, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year, we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and the second quarter, with recovery in the back half. With that recovery in the back half, we believe the business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. 
And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our Integrated Vision Solutions business and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that, we really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit kind of initial framework is the right way to look at it really across the portfolio. 
And one last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. It's right. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures next year.

And again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call, the last few days, when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean it's probably been a blur for all of us. But we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain channels. Just 8 months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room. And the real focus there was on the first-tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then, we've learned a lot about the second-, third- and fourth-tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency. So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. 
Of course, we shifted. And I would say, we always focus on the supply chain. We added in remote working, IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster, but the key has been getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility. And all of that has improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to kind of make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. 
Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year. And August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe, and that really kind of threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming and our baseline is kind of a 12-month delay until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time frames out there, but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. 
I will mention, as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as DPAS ratings, which are the Defense Priorities and Allocation System. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it, but they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. So -- but that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers."

And just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer-term commitments of 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. we've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we secured alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualified them. We're redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate source of supply going into next year. And we're making progress across each of these areas, which, again, is where we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year. 
As far as supply chain specifically, the supply chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us. When you think about 2022, right now, the way I'm thinking about it is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we're considering, that's something that we've got baked in and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be, as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix as well as supply chain and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. And next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher. But nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it."

We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to 2 things. One is, as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in cost. We expect to see continued spending in that area probably through midyear next year as we complete those factory consolidations. 
The other element is really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the costs on -- related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect, into next year as well some -- for a period of time, again, probably through the first 6 months. 
On your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us, the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just the increased use of assets. And so if we're able to do that, we should be able to at least hold the working capital flat, if not become a source of income -- or source of cash flow. And then we can have that added to drop-through of net income. And so it really remains the same. As far as our working capital, when you go back and look, we've got -- we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got 7 sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really -- again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. These include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain. Continue to work -- and Chris mentioned it -- on cycle time reductions and automations in the factory as well as just negotiating better terms on our contracts, getting more advances where you look and maybe compared to some of our other peers, their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours. And so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity-rich here. 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look, from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future."

And I'll just say in the IT world, we had laid out an architecture. And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we reprioritized and made some changes, which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. 
Same thing applied to supply chain. We had a whole strategy, and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identify risks using publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability of the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year and are rolling that out in Q3 and Q4. So some of those things seem to make business sense to increase the cost and accelerate the expenditures based on what was going on."

I mean, just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including, most recently, using an independent reviewer. So there's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And that aligns with our strategy and the R&D investments that we've made in moving up the food chain. So I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other company as to what they're going to do next. 
But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place, which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted, we're ready to go. Or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. So we'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. 
F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously a key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22 and then starts to grow again in '23. That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. 
And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw from the prime is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircraft. So that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the aircraft memory system. We just completed safety of flight certification. So that was quite exciting. A lot of positive e-mails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on AMS. 
The panoramic cockpit display is entering qualification testing. And then, of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex. And again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard parts ahead of us here is the integration testing that's going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned. Everybody understands the goals, the challenges and the critical path. And we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitments."

You're well aware of those large IDIQs and how there's a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22. 
Internationally, I think there continues to be lots of interest for this year. Asia Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid East is a little flat. But as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching. So I think Jay did a good job. 
But just highlighting it, we look like -- we do about $400 million -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million roughly per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million. And the fourth quarter, we're probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range, depending on supply chain. 
I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year, the $300 million to $400 million range, and then maybe ramping up to $500 million-plus for the second half of '22. And the first 2 quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe.

And what we've been able to do in each case is win front-end type of contracts. And so right now, with this particular country, we won about 5,000 radios. That could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. 
The same thing goes with the U.K. We just won an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios, and that positions us well for what could be also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, $1 billion-plus program. And similarly Australia, you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios in our ballpark. We also won an opportunity there to do some crypto modernization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us -- positions us very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries. 
We've got a DoD opportunity coming up either this quarter or next quarter with the Marine Corps. We feel confident in our positioning there in our product offering for that. And so we're confident and bullish about the opportunities for the tactical radio in radio business going forward and our positioning as well."

So the way I look at it is we're a year or 2 ahead that target. And the goal for '22 and beyond will be to, at a minimum, maintain these margins, but look for ways to increase it. I mean some of the things that contributed -- and I'll let Jay give you more details on Q3. We've really been focusing on our discretionary spend, the SG&A. I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. 
We continue to invest in the IRAD at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioning us for this growth that we talk about going forward. And the mix from these new awards. I talked about some of these awards being delayed. I think you know most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if they're cost-plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative. So with those slipping to Q4, I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it kind of on an annual basis. And year-over-year progress is looking good, and we're not going to give up and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. 
I mean the E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. I mean we're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker. We've talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable.

I tried to maybe too subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right, what we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast the programs, which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses, you're forecasting demand. Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months in advance like we used to in the past. 
So when you look at the supply chain challenges, to the extent it's a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right, you'll see that as a bow wave. A majority of our company, and I think the whole industry, uses percent complete or over time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you're going to see as a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. 
So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the DPAS ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts, and that's something that's very important to all of us, and we'll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments. The revenue shortfall was our focus on overdriving and challenging the team to get year-over-year growth.

No, Peter, the $350 million target we threw out was the cost synergies from the merger, so we'll be kind of putting a bow on that here in the next few quarters, and we've overdriven the synergies that we laid out. Anything post the merger synergies, we'll just count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on international as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the day to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships, it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face to face. But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently. We're going to have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Having less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes I highlighted in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. 
Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated and the difficulty of getting labor. But now we're picking that pace back up again. So yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. So thank you for the question, Peter. 
I guess with that, we'll just kind of wrap it up for the day. So obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who are focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. So I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks."

Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic",1968,"Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. Absent such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry best market position for radios. And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front, we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double digit on both accounts. 
Shifting over to the third quarter. Following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CS and an ISR aircraft award at IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07, and we delivered record high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21, up 13% versus the prior year, with solid free cash flow of $673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in the quarter. Our execution against the company's strategic priorities have been a key factor in value creation for all stakeholders in spite of the pandemic. And we made progress in the quarter by advancing top line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping and returning capital to our owners. 
Starting with the top line. The revenue decline in the quarter fell short of our internal targets largely due to 2 timing factors. At CS, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics-focused businesses, notably Tactical Communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue. And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow. And all told, we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CS. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings nor our win rates and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over 1x. 
In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full-rate production contract with the U.S. Army. Second, at IMS, we had a follow-on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 point shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I've been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. 
Within the space domain, on the classified side, we continued to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the Intel community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion. And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review and the development of the Missile Tracking Satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. 
Moving to the air domain. Key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft. On the B-52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition, on the international front, we were awarded an initial $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE, with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our RSR capabilities that range from turboprops, to business jets, to large aircraft. 
And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities. Under the Army HMS program, we received over $200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full-rate production awards out of a multibillion-dollar IDIQ and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also won a majority share on the second program of record for the EMV GV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field-ready goggles. So we were 3 for 3 on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. 
Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation class frigate, with follow-on awards for the next shipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several hundred million dollar opportunity for L3Harris. 
We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One, to provide electro-optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another within international ally, highlighting our superior undersea sensor capabilities. Both could expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered Power Conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class Block V upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbia class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. 
We also had a key award within our Mission Networks business. We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity and strengthens L3Harris' long-standing relationship with Australia. 
Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a Mid East customer to provide modernized software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channel synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios. When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to date totaled roughly $900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. With a pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top line growth. 
These wins supported another strong quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.07 and 1.06x year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion or up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. 
Shifting over to the outlook for budgets. We're pleased with the progress made on the FY '22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR. The plus ups from the HASC, SAP and SACD, along with steadiness from HACD, combined with recent global events, provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions, which we're focused on providing. 
All in all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of $100 billion. 
Pivoting to margin performance. Our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another $15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures. This program is one of our key discriminators. 
And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First, is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out cost. A great example is a pilot program in our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year rollout ahead of us. 
The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence and supply chain. On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. 
On supply chain, a global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the company and are temporary in nature. The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers or leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place, with further opportunities in the years ahead. 
Moving over to the portfolio. We put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the Electron Devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses within AS for a combined $130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation. Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. 
Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. 
In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1%, lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays and ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CS were down 3% and 5%, respectively, and absent these impacts would have been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business, while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in Commercial Aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6%, with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance and cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal expectations by more than 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering on E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs and retirement of risk. 
These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20. And pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08. That more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays. 
Free cash flow was $673 million, and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. This supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion, comprised of $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3%, driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth, for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our Maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation-class Frigate and classified programs. 
Operating income was up 4%, and margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, with strength across the segment. 
In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 program within Mission Avionics as well as program timing in electronic warfare and Intel and Cyber. We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. 
Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in space. And funded book-to-bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other space awards. 
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was down 5%, due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stem from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8 point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations, as well as lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments. In addition, the Integrated Vision and Global Communications Solutions businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs, respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double digits versus the prior year and sequentially and strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System award in the prior quarter. 
Operating income decreased 1%, and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios and integration benefits that outweigh supply chain impacts and higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and Integrated Vision for modernization alongside key state-level awards within public safety. 
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 1%. By commercial aerospace business, that was up over 40% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish sales in Mission Networks as well as lower fusing and ordinate systems volume due to contract roll-offs along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.4% as expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery and integration benefits more than offset divestiture-related headwinds. And funded book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date. 
Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2%, with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays. At a segment level, we've maintained our sales guides, but for CS, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5% versus our prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within Tactical Communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single digits. 
For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft, while SAS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within space and Intel and Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to award timing slipping to the fourth quarter within our classified business. 
By end market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid- to high single digits on average. 
Turning to margins. We've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to date, E3 progress and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays, along with mix effects on new earlier-stage programs, but still strong progress for the full year. 
From a segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint, delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. 
As shown on Slide 11, the midpoint is now at $12.93. That's $0.55 from improvement in operations and other items, including the release of contingencies, offset by additional divested earnings of about $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays. As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. 
Moving to free cash flow. Our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture headwinds and now supply chain delays of over $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3- to 5-day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And CapEx is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures. 
Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. Net of these puts and takes, we're in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double digits in 2021. 
Okay. Let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound, and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft missionization, DoD and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future. 
As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall will be recovered by the end of next year, and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates and tax rules. 
Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic-related headwinds for a seventh straight quarter and delivered strong bottom line performance and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. 
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

And I think you said it right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably 3 years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note that I want to go back and reinforce. And one was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses and, after the merger, how we're well positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment, which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China, China, China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think, puts us in a good position to support the war fighter. Our cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. Like what we've done in the air domain, while there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. 
And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well positioned in all these domains. And I think you see that reflected in our results and what we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. 
The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come. So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago and have talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well positioned with the DoD in all domains. We have a great revenue synergy opportunity and process. And our international growth has been a bright spot over the last couple of years. So as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall company coming in, in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. 
We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the $800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay?"
177934,1683507974,2418466,"L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I t",890,"Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well as far as broad growth across the portfolio. 
I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4 to 6 we said that will be probably towards the upper end of this year. And we see a lot of the same going into '22 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower for us on the back of international aircraft missionization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual [ throughput ] related to missionization in the aircraft. You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, I talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of missionization. So that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver low to mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. 
On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards of electrooptical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that. That would be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low to mid-single-digit next year. 
And the final business within IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the past, really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation-class Frigate. We've won some awards in class on the classified, undersea sensors. And we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime, and we expect that to deliver, frankly, mid- to high single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well positioned to do a low to mid-single digit, if not more. 
When you look at Space and Airborne Systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid- to high single digits growth there. Same thing with Intel & Cyber. We continue to see growth in demand in the classified areas in both of those businesses. That will be tempered a bit our airborne businesses. We've seen this year that the transition, particularly mission avionics on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year as well as some -- program transition -- transitions on the -- in electronic warfare, particularly in the F-16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward very easily being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. 
I'll go next to maybe AS and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry. We continue to expect traffic growth next year, and we expect that business to grow in line with that. So you can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. 
Mission Networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award. That will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And then our Defense Aviation is seeing a little bit of the delays related to award timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver, the segment can deliver low to mid-single-digit growth. 
And then finally, CS. We've talked about tac comm, the supply chain pressures there. This year, that business will be down about 10%. And we see if you think about tac comm, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year, we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and the second quarter, with recovery in the back half. With that recovery in the back half, we believe the business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. 
And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our Integrated Vision Solutions business and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that, we really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit kind of initial framework is the right way to look at it really across the portfolio. 
And one last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. It's right. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures next year. But again, started with the organic, really low to mid-single digit is probably the best place for us to be until we solidify our expectations, and we'll do that in January for you. So hopefully, I went around the horn and gave you some color within each of the segments and really give you the source of why we feel confident and are gaining confidence in our ability to deliver that type of growth."

And again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call, the last few days, when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean it's probably been a blur for all of us. But we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain channels. Just 8 months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room. And the real focus there was on the first-tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then, we've learned a lot about the second-, third- and fourth-tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency. So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. 
Of course, we shifted. And I would say, we always focus on the supply chain. We added in remote working, IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster, but the key has been getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility. And all of that has improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to kind of make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. 
Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year. And August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe, and that really kind of threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming and our baseline is kind of a 12-month delay until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time frames out there, but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. 
I will mention, as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as DPAS ratings, which are the Defense Priorities and Allocation System. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it, but they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. So -- but that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers."

And just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer-term commitments of 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. we've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we secured alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualified them. We're redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate source of supply going into next year. And we're making progress across each of these areas, which, again, is where we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year. 
As far as supply chain specifically, the supply chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us. When you think about 2022, right now, the way I'm thinking about it is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we're considering, that's something that we've got baked in and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be, as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix as well as supply chain and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. And next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher. But nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it."

We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to two things. One is, as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in cost. We expect to see continued spending in that area probably through midyear next year as we complete those factory consolidations. 
The other element is really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the costs on -- related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect, into next year as well some -- for a period of time, again, probably through the first 6 months. 
On your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us, the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just the increased use of assets. And so if we're able to do that, we should be able to at least hold the working capital flat, if not become a source of income -- or source of cash flow. And then we can have that added to drop-through of net income. And so it really remains the same. As far as our working capital, when you go back and look, we've got -- we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got 7 sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really -- again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. These include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain. Continue to work -- and Chris mentioned it -- on cycle time reductions and automations in the factory as well as just negotiating better terms on our contracts, getting more advances where you look and maybe compared to some of our other peers, their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours. And so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity-rich here. 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look, from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future."

And I'll just say in the IT world, we had laid out an architecture. And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we reprioritized and made some changes, which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. 
Same thing applied to supply chain. We had a whole strategy, and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identify risks using publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability of the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year and are rolling that out in Q3 and Q4. So some of those things seem to make business sense to increase the cost and accelerate the expenditures based on what was going on."

I mean, just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including, most recently, using an independent reviewer. So there's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And that aligns with our strategy and the R&D investments that we've made in moving up the food chain. So I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other company as to what they're going to do next. 
But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place, which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted, we're ready to go. Or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. So we'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. 
F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously a key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22 and then starts to grow again in '23. That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. 
And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw from the prime is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircraft. So that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the Aircraft Memory System. We just completed safety of flight certification. So that was quite exciting. A lot of positive e-mails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on AMS. 
The Panoramic Cockpit Display is entering qualification testing. And then, of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex. And again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard parts ahead of us here is the integration testing that's going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned. Everybody understands the goals, the challenges and the critical path. And we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitments."

You're well aware of those large IDIQs and how there's a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22. 
Internationally, I think there continues to be lots of interest for this year. Asia Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid East is a little flat. But as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching. So I think Jay did a good job. 
But just highlighting it, we look like -- we do about $400 million -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million roughly per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million. And the fourth quarter, we're probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range, depending on supply chain. 
I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year, the $300 million to $400 million range, and then maybe ramping up to $500 million-plus for the second half of '22. And the first 2 quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe.

That could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. 
The same thing goes with the U.K. We just won an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios, and that positions us well for what could be also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, $1 billion-plus program. And similarly Australia, you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios in our ballpark. We also won an opportunity there to do some crypto modernization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us -- positions us very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries.

I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. 
We continue to invest in the IRAD at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioning us for this growth that we talk about going forward. And the mix from these new awards. I talked about some of these awards being delayed. I think you know most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if they're cost-plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative. So with those slipping to Q4, I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it kind of on an annual basis. And year-over-year progress is looking good, and we're not going to give up and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. 
I mean the E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. I mean we're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker. We've talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable. We talk about designing for manufacture, design for supply chain. All those initiatives are ongoing and getting better each and every time. So I don't know, Jay, if there's you want to give."

But I'd like to -- what I want to understand is -- and the supply chain issues have clearly held you back some in Communication Systems this year, and you talked about the first half of next year. But unlike some commercial businesses, I wouldn't expect any of the deliveries and revenues that you were expecting to have gone away. And when you think forward, should we expect a snapback eventually here where you've just -- you've built up -- you've got a building up of sort of a backlog of demand and we should actually see a what I would think it was kind of a surge when we get into 2023 when you're finally delivering on things that have been delayed?"

I tried to maybe too subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right, what we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast the programs, which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses, you're forecasting demand. Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months in advance like we used to in the past. 
So when you look at the supply chain challenges, to the extent it's a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right, you'll see that as a bow wave. A majority of our company, and I think the whole industry, uses percent complete or over time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you're going to see as a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. 
So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the DPAS ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts, and that's something that's very important to all of us, and we'll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments. The revenue shortfall was our focus on overdriving and challenging the team to get year-over-year growth. But as far as the contracts, we're tracking and we're in constant communication with all of our customers, and they understand where we are. So I don't know if that helps you, Doug, but that's a long way of saying I agree with you."

Anything post the merger synergies, we'll just count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on international as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the day to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships, it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face to face. But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently. We're going to have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Having less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes I highlighted in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. 
Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated and the difficulty of getting labor. But now we're picking that pace back up again. So yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. So thank you for the question, Peter. 
I guess with that, we'll just kind of wrap it up for the day. So obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who are focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. So I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks."

As you've seen throughout the week, no company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic",1964,"Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no company is immune, including L3Harris, to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. Absent such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry-best market position for radios. And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front, we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double digit on both accounts. 
Shifting over to the third quarter. Following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CS and an ISR aircraft award at IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07, and we delivered record-high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21, up 13% versus the prior year, with solid free cash flow of $673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in the quarter. Our execution against the company's strategic priorities have been a key factor in value creation for all stakeholders in spite of the pandemic. And we made progress in the quarter by advancing top line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping and returning capital to our owners. 
Starting with the top line. The revenue decline in the quarter fell short of our internal targets largely due to 2 timing factors. At CS, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics-focused businesses, notably Tactical Communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue. And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow. And all told, we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CS. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings nor our win rates and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over 1x. 
In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full-rate production contract with the U.S. Army. Second, at IMS, we had a follow-on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 point shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I've been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. 
Within the space domain, on the classified side, we continued to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the Intel community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion. And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review and the development of the Missile Tracking Satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. 
Moving to the air domain. Key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft. On the B-52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition, on the international front, we were awarded an initial $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE, with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our RSR capabilities that range from turboprops, to business jets, to large aircraft. 
And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities. Under the Army HMS program, we received over $200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full-rate production awards out of a multibillion-dollar IDIQ and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also won a majority share on the second program of record for the EMV GV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field-ready goggles. So we were 3 for 3 on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. 
Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation-class Frigate, with follow-on awards for the next shipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several hundred million dollar opportunity for L3Harris. 
We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One, to provide electro-optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another within international ally, highlighting our superior undersea sensor capabilities. Both would expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered Power Conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class Block V upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbia class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. 
We also had a key award within our Mission Networks business. We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity and strengthens L3Harris' long-standing relationship with Australia. 
Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a Mid-East customer to provide modernized software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channel synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios. When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to date totaled roughly $900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. With a pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top line growth. 
These wins supported another strong quarter for a book-to-bill of 1.07 and 1.06x year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion or up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. 
Shifting over to the outlook for budgets. We're pleased with the progress made on the FY '22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR. The plus ups from the HASC, SAP and SACD, along with steadiness from HACD, combined with recent global events, provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions, which we're focused on providing. 
All in all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of $100 billion. 
Pivoting to margin performance. Our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another $15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures. This program is one of our key discriminators. 
And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out cost. A great example is a pilot program in our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year rollout ahead of us. 
The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence and supply chain. On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. 
On supply chain, the global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the company and are temporary in nature. The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers or leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place, with further opportunities in the years ahead. 
Moving over to the portfolio. We put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the Electron Devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses within AS for a combined $130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation. Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. 
Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Jay."

First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook.

First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. 
In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1%, lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays and ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CS were down 3% and 5%, respectively, and absent these impacts would have been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business, while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in Commercial Aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6%, with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance and cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal expectations by more than 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering on E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs and retirement of risk. 
These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20. And pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08. That more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays. 
Free cash flow was $673 million, and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. This supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion, comprised of $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3%, driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth, for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our Maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation-class Frigate and classified programs. 
Operating income was up 4%, and margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, with strength across the segment. 
In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 program within Mission Avionics as well as program timing in electronic warfare and Intel and Cyber. We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. 
Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in space. And funded book-to-bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other space awards. 
Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was down 5%, due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stem from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8-point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations, as well as lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments. In addition, the Integrated Vision and Global Communications Solutions businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs, respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double digits versus the prior year and sequentially and strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System award in the prior quarter. 
Operating income decreased 1%, and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios and integration benefits that outweighed supply chain impacts and higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and Integrated Vision for modernization alongside key state-level awards within public safety. 
Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 1%. By commercial aerospace business, that was up over 40% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish sales in Mission Networks as well as lower fusing and ordinate systems volume due to contract roll-offs along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.4% as expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery and integration benefits more than offset divestiture-related headwinds. And funded book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date. 
Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2%, with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays. At a segment level, we've maintained our sales guides, but for CS, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5% versus our prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within Tactical Communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single digits. 
For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft, while SAS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within space and Intel and Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to award timing slipping to the fourth quarter within our classified business. 
By end market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid- to high single digits on average. 
Turning to margins. We've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to date, E3 progress and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays, along with mix effects on new earlier-stage programs, but still strong progress for the full year. 
From a segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint, delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. 
As shown on Slide 11, the midpoint is now at $12.93. That's $0.55 from improvement in operations and other items, including the release of contingencies, offset by additional divested earnings of about $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays. As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. 
Moving to free cash flow. Our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture headwinds and now supply chain delays of over $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3- to 5-day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And CapEx is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures. 
Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. Net of these puts and takes, we're in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double digits in 2021. 
Okay. Let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound, and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft missionization, DoD and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future. 
As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall will be recovered by the end of next year, and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates and tax rules. 
Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic-related headwinds for a seventh straight quarter and delivered strong bottom line performance and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. 
With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions."

And I think you said it right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably 3 years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note that I want to go back and reinforce. And one was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses and, after the merger, how we're well positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment, which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China, China, China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think, puts us in a good position to support the war fighter. Our cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. Like what we've done in the air domain, while there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. 
And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well positioned in all these domains. And I think you see that reflected in our results and what we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. 
The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come. So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago and have talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well positioned with the DoD in all domains. We have a great revenue synergy opportunity and process. And our international growth has been the bright spot over the last couple of years. So as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall company coming in, in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. 
We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the $800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay?"

And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I t",888,"Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year, when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year, what I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well as far as broad growth across the portfolio. 
I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4% to 6%. We said that will be probably towards the upper end of this year. And we see a lot of the same going into '22 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower for us on the back of international aircraft missionization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual throughput related to missionization in the aircraft. You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, I talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of missionization. So that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver low to mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. 
On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards of electrooptical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that. That would be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low to mid-single-digit next year. 
And the final business within IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the -- really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation-class Frigate. We've won some awards in class on the classified, undersea sensors. And we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime, and we expect that to deliver, frankly, mid- to high single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well positioned to do a low to mid-single digit, if not more. 
When you look at Space and Airborne Systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid- to high single-digits growth there. Same thing with Intel and Cyber. We continue to see growth in demand in the classified areas in both of those businesses. That will be tempered a bit our airborne businesses. We've seen this year that the transition, particularly in mission avionics on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year as well as some -- program transition -- transitions on the -- in electronic warfare, particularly in the F-16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward very easily being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. 
I'll go next to maybe AS and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry. We continue to expect traffic growth next year, and we expect that business to grow in line with that. So you can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. 
Mission Networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award. That will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And then our Defense Aviation is seeing a little bit of the delays related to award timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver, the segment can deliver low to mid-single-digit growth. 
And then finally, CS. We've talked about tac comm, the supply chain pressures there. This year, that business will be down about 10%. And we see if you think about tac comm, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year, we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and the second quarter, with recovery in the back half. With that recovery in the back half, we believe the business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. 
And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our Integrated Vision Solutions business and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that, we really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit kind of initial framework is the right way to look at it really across the portfolio. 
And one last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. It's right. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures next year. But again, started with the organic, really low to mid-single digit is probably the best place for us to be until we solidify our expectations, and we'll do that in January for you. So hopefully, I went around the horn and gave you some color within each of the segments and really give you the source of why we feel confident and are gaining confidence in our ability to deliver that type of growth."

And again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call, the last few days, when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean it's probably been a blur for all of us. But we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain channels. Just 8 months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room. And the real focus there was on the first-tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then, we've learned a lot about the second-, third- and fourth-tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency. So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. 
Of course, we shifted. And I would say, we always focus on the supply chain. We added in remote working, IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a rollercoaster, but the key has been getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility. And all of that has improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to kind of make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. 
Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year. And August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe, and that really kind of threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming and our baseline is kind of a 12-month delay until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time frames out there, but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. 
I will mention, as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as DPAS ratings, which are the Defense Priorities and Allocation System. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it, but they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. So -- but that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers."

And just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer-term commitments of 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. We've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we secured alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualified them. We're redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate source of supply going into next year. And we're making progress across each of these areas, which, again, is where we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year. 
As far as supply chain specifically, the supply chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us. When you think about 2022, right now, the way I'm thinking about it is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we're considering, that's something that we've got baked in and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be, as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix as well as supply chain and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. And next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher. But nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it."

We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to 2 things. One is, as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in cost. We expect to see continued spending in that area probably through midyear next year as we complete those factory consolidations. 
The other element is really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the costs on -- related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect, into next year as well some -- for a period of time, again, probably through the first 6 months. 
On your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us, the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just the increased use of assets. And so if we're able to do that, we should be able to at least hold the working capital flat, if not become a source of income -- or source of cash flow. And then we can have that added to drop-through of net income. And so it really remains the same. As far as our working capital, when you go back and look, we've got -- we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got 7 sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really -- again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. These include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain. Continue to work -- and Chris mentioned it on cycle time reductions and automations in the factory as well as just negotiating better terms on our contracts, getting more advances where you look and maybe compare to some of our other peers, their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours. And so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity-rich here. 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look, from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future."

And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we reprioritized and made some changes, which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. 
Same thing applied to supply chain. We had a whole strategy, and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identify risks using publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability of the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year and are rolling that out in Q3 and Q4.

I mean, just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including, most recently, using an independent reviewer. So there's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And that aligns with our strategy and the R&D investments that we've made in moving up the food chain. So I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other company as to what they're going to do next. 
But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place, which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted, we're ready to go or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. So we'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. 
F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously a key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22 and then starts to grow again in '23. That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. 
And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw from the prime is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircraft. So that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the Aircraft Memory System. We just completed safety of flight certification. So that was quite exciting. A lot of positive e-mails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on AMS. 
The Panoramic Cockpit Display is entering qualification testing. And then, of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex. And again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard parts ahead of us here is the integration testing that's going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned. Everybody understands the goals, the challenges and the critical path. And we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitments."

Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.7 and year-to-date, we're almost at 1.2. So there's absolutely 0 issue with the demand. I highlighted some of the significant wins that we had recently with the Army. You're well aware of those large IDIQs and how there's a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22. 
Internationally, I think there continues to be lots of interest. For this year, Asia Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid-East is a little flat. But as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching. So I think Jay did a good job. 
But just highlighting it, we look like -- we do about $400 million -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million roughly per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million. And the fourth quarter, we're probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range, depending on supply chain. 
I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year, the $300 million to $400 million range, and then maybe ramping up to $500 million-plus for the second half of '22. And the first 2 quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe. So I don't know, Jay, if there's more."

Chris mentioned, I think, in his remarks as well as far as a Middle East customer. What we have here, these are $1 billion-plus-type opportunities with this Middle East customer as well as in the U.K. and Australia. And what we've been able to do in each case is win front-end type of contracts. And so right now, with this particular country, we won about 5,000 radios. That could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. 
The same thing goes with the U.K. We just won an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios, and that positions us well for what could be also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, $1 billion-plus program. And similarly Australia, you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios in our ballpark. We also won an opportunity there to do some crypto modernization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us -- positions us very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries. 
We've got a DoD opportunity coming up either this quarter or next quarter with the Marine Corps. We feel confident in our positioning there in our product offering for that. And so we're confident and bullish about the opportunities for the tactical radio in radio business going forward and our positioning as well."

So no, it's -- as I said earlier, everything related to the merger is going quicker and better than maybe anyone had expected or planned. And we talked about a 25 basis point increase year-over-year. So the way I look at it is we're a year or 2 ahead of that target. And the goal for '22 and beyond will be to, at a minimum, maintain these margins, but look for ways to increase it. I mean some of the things that contributed and I'll let Jay give you more details on Q3. We've really been focusing on our discretionary spend, the SG&A. I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. 
We continue to invest in the IRAD at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioning us for this growth that we talk about going forward. And the mix from these new awards, we talked about some of these awards being delayed. I think you know most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if they're cost-plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative. So with those slipping to Q4, I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it kind of on an annual basis. And year-over-year progress is looking good, and we're not going to give up and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. 
I mean the E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. I mean we're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker. We've talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable. We talk about designing for manufacture, design for supply chain. All those initiatives are ongoing and getting better each and every time. So I don't know, Jay, if there's further color you want to give."

But I'd like to -- what I want to understand is -- and the supply chain issues have clearly held you back some in Communication Systems this year, and you talked about the first half of next year. But unlike some commercial businesses, I wouldn't expect any of the deliveries and revenues that you were expecting to have gone away. And when you think forward, should we expect a snapback eventually here where you've just -- you've built up -- you've got a building up of sort of a backlog of demand and we should actually see a -- what I would think it was kind of a surge when we get into 2023 when you're finally delivering on things that have been delayed?"

I tried to maybe too subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right, what we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast to programs, which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses, you're forecasting demand. Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months in advance like we used to in the past. 
So when you look at the supply chain challenges, to the extent it's a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right, you'll see that as a bow wave. Majority of our company, and I think the whole industry, uses percent complete or over-time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you're going to see as a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. 
So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the DPAS ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts, and that's something that's very important to all of us, and we'll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments. The revenue shortfall was our focus on overdriving and challenging the team to get year-over-year growth. But as far as the contracts, we're tracking and we're in constant communication with all of our customers, and they understand where we are. So I don't know if that helps you, Doug, but that's a long way of saying I agree with you."

Anything post the merger synergies, we'll just count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on international as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the day to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships, it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face to face. But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently. We're going to have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Having less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes I highlighted in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. 
Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated and the difficulty of getting labor. But now we're picking that pace back up again. So yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. So thank you for the question, Peter. 
I guess with that, we'll just kind of wrap it up for the day. So obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who are focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. So I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks."
