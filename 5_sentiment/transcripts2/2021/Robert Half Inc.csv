Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call. 
During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures as adjusted reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. In addition, we'd like to remind you that beginning last quarter, we modified our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for account Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, and Robert Half Management Resources to include their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedule as just mentioned, also include our revenue schedule showing this information for 2018, 2019 as well as 2020. 
For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available at the investor center of our website at roberthalf.com. 
Fourth quarter results for both our Protiviti and staffing operations were very strong and exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Protiviti reported its 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, with particular strength in its technology consulting practice and managed solutions with staffing. Our staffing operations reported broad-based, double-digit quarter-on-quarter sequential revenue growth on an as-adjusted basis. I could not be more proud of our teams have managed through this extraordinary year. Over the past several months, they've made significant impacts, helping our clients succeed and job candidates find meaningful work. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and down 15% from last year's fourth quarter on a reported basis and down 16% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.84 compared to $0.98 in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow before financing activities during the quarter was $85 million. In December, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $39 million. We also acquired 1.1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $63 million. We have 9.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan. 
Return on invested capital for the company was 31% in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter. This is a decrease of 15% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 16% on an as-adjusted basis. 
On an as-adjusted basis, fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 24% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $723 million, down 25% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, down 23% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the fourth quarter, there were 61.7 billing days, equal to the number of billing days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current first quarter has 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The billing days for 2021 by quarter are 62.3, 63.4, 64.4, and 61.7 for a total of 251.8 days, which is approximately 1 day less than 2020 due to it being a leap year. 
Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-on-year staffing revenues by $8 million. This increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business. This rate for Q3 2020 was 3.1%. 
Now let's take a closer look at revenues for Protiviti. Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $362 million, $294 million of that is from business within the United States and $68 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 18% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 23%. Non-U.S. revenues were down 2% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 1 percentage point. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. 
Turning to SG&A presentation. As first noted last quarter, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are now included in SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, direct cost with offsetting changes in the investment trust assets presented separately below SG&A. 
As a reminder, our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. For your convenience, we've added another supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Pages 12 and 13, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, fourth quarter gross margin was 38.5% of applicable revenues compared to 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower payroll taxes, insurance and other fringe costs. 
Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 9.7% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter to 44.4%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin was $96 million in the fourth quarter or 26.5% of Protiviti revenues. This includes $5 million or 1.5% of Protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expenses related to increases in the underlying investment assets. One year ago, gross margin Protiviti was $90 million or 29.7% of Protiviti revenues including $2 million of deferred compensation expense or 0.7% of Protiviti revenues related to investment trust activities. 
Company-wide selling, general and administrative costs were 32.6% of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Deferred compensation expenses related to increase in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue to 2.7% in the current third quarter and 1.2% in the same quarter 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 39.7% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 36.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 3.7% and 1.5%, respectively. We ended 2020 with 7,800 full-time internal staff in our staffing divisions, down 32% from the prior year. 
Fourth quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 14.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.1% of revenues in the year ago period. We ended 2020 with 7,300 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 34% from the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $89 million. This includes $41 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in underlying investment trust assets. Combined segment income was, therefore, $130 million in the fourth quarter. Combined segment margin was 9.9%. Fourth quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $79 million with a segment margin of 8.4%. Segment income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter was $51 million with a segment margin of 13.9%. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27% for both the current and prior period years. Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable was $714 million and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO was 49.4 days. 
Before we move on first quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2020 and so far in January 2021, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions ended the fourth quarter with December revenues down 20.8% versus the prior year compared to a 23.8% decrease for the fourth -- for the full quarter. Revenues in the first 3 weeks of January were down 23% compared to the period -- compared to the same period a year ago. 
Permanent place revenues in December were down 25.4% versus December of 2019. This compares to a 28.5% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of January, permanent placement revenues were down 20% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have an insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January. But as you know, these very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. With that in mind, we are the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1.29 billion to $1.37 billion. Income per share $0.74 to $0.84. 
The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 11.7% on an as-adjusted basis including Protiviti and EPS returning to prior year levels. 
The major financial assumptions underlying midpoint of these assumptions are as follows. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing, down 19% to 21%; Protiviti, up 23% to 25%; overall, down 11% to 13%. Gross margin percentages, temporary and consulting staffing, 37% to 38%; Protiviti, 25% to 26%; overall, 38% to 39%. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing, 35% to 36%; Protiviti, 14% to 15%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: staffing, 8% to 9%; Protiviti, 10% to 12%; overall, 8% to 10%. 
2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs for the year, $85 million to $95 million with $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter. Tax rate, 27% to 28%. Shares, $113 million. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and with our advanced AI-driven capabilities are providing clients with real-time choices of candidates from outside their local market area. 
Owing to its diversified solution offerings, Protiviti contents is record of multiyear double-digit revenue growth and very positive pipeline. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing is at an all-time high and evidenced by the 82% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter from the unique blend of consulting and staffing solutions. 
Staffing services provided to our mid-cap clients now approaches 1/3 of our revenues and growing, and this is incremental to our traditional focus on SMB clients and prospects. With multiple vaccines now rolling out throughout the world and physical and monetary policy port expected to continue globally, economists are increasingly expecting GDP growth to follow. GDP driven early cycle growth is traditionally particularly robust for SMB clients that are lean and nimble for downturn and have pent-up demand to restore and upskill their workforce as they return to growth. 
More than ever, we believe the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model position us future success in 2021 and beyond.

FSI continues to lead with anti-money laundering and consumer lending regulatory actions leading that way. Internal audits, down 8% to 10% year-on-year. Some work got delayed. Some got reduced. There's a little bit of fee pressure. As we've talked about now for a few quarters, Protiviti's pipeline remains very strong as to which inning we're in. It's clearly not a late inning because not only do we have macro coming back and discretionary spending that will benefit, particularly internal audit.

So now it's time to endure the good side of SMB, and we're excited about how well we can leverage our SMB client base as we've demonstrated in the past. That said, we do think mid-cap is incremental to that. We've done well. We've done it without any net margin dilution and we continue to invest in that."

We service that primarily with contractors, which is why when you look at the supplemental schedules where we break out the intersegment revenues, you see there was a $30 million spike between quarters 3 and 4, and the lion's share of that was public sector related. As to sustainability, the jury is out. That said, we have relationships we've never had before. We've certainly got a look into many local, regional, state governments and their business processes. And we certainly are excited at the opportunity to improve those processes, be it overpayments. A lot in the press about some fraud as it relates to payment of unemployment claims. And so again, there's no question that there is some spike in that as it relates to elevated unemployment claims that the states are having to process, same for housing assistance, same for remote learning support for school systems. That said, we do believe we're confident, and we've got teams put together, whose objective is just what you described as far as ensuring the sustainability and leveraging these new relationships that we've never had.

Real estate is more nuanced. On the one hand, traditionally, our real estate is very dense. We put a lot of people in our space. There's not a lot of square footage traditionally per person. In today's world of distancing even post pandemic query weather, we'll have to relax that somewhat and offset what we'd otherwise save if we're on a hybrid model where everybody doesn't come in every day. So the jury is out on that. I mean, our current thinking is probably more a push than anything, but it's early days, and we don't know. We don't know ultimately how many people are going to want to work remotely versus come in. And further, we don't know whether the density we've traditionally had, which kind of creates an electricity and energy level in an office, which has been helpful, we'll know whether we're going to have to spread people out more for obvious reasons. It's kind of interesting. Australia has some of the fewest number of cases, and so I would argue their most along post pandemic, and they've been surprised how much people want to come in and don't want to work remotely. And in fact,  they talk about, it's 90% to 95% of the staff want to come back into the office. That surprises me. Whether that's sustainable in Australia itself or whether you can replicate that in other places, I don't know, but that's what they report."

These risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.
During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures as, as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release.
In addition, we'd like to remind you that beginning last quarter, we modified our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources to include their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions.
This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include our revenue schedule showing this information back for 2018, 2019 as well as 2020. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available at the Investor Center of our website at roberthalf.com.
Fourth quarter results for both our Protiviti and staffing operations were very strong and exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Protiviti reported its 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains with particular strength in its technology consulting practice and managed solutions with staffing. Our staffing operations reported broad-based, double-digit, quarter-on-quarter sequential revenue growth on an as-adjusted basis. I could not be more proud of our teams have managed through this extraordinary year. Over the past several months, they've made significant impacts, helping our clients succeed and job candidates find meaningful work.
Company-wide revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 15% from last year's fourth quarter on a reported basis and down 16% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.84 compared to $0.98 in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow before financing activities during the quarter was $85 million. In December, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $39 million. We also acquired 1.1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter for $63 million. We have 9.9 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 31% in the fourth quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter. This is a decrease of 15% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 16% on an as-ad",1329,"Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter. This is a decrease of 15% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 16% on an as-adjusted basis.
On an as-adjusted basis, fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 24% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $723 million, down 25% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, down 23% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
In the fourth quarter, there were 61.7 billing days, equal to the number of billing days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current first quarter has 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The billing days for 2021 by quarter are 62.3, 63.4, 64.4 and 61.7 for a total of 251.8 days, which is approximately 1 day less than 2020 due to it being a leap year.
Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-on-year staffing revenues by $8 million. This increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business. This rate for Q3 2020 was 3.1%.
Now let's take a closer look at revenues for Protiviti. Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $362 million. $294 million of that is from business within the United States, and $68 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 18% versus the year ago period with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 23%. Non-U.S. revenues were down 2% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 1 percentage point. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
Turning to SG&A presentation. As first noted last quarter, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are now included in SG&A or in the case of Protiviti, direct cost with offsetting changes in the investment trust assets presented separately below SG&A. As a reminder, our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
For your convenience, we've added another supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Pages 12 and 13 highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, fourth quarter gross margin was 38.5% of applicable revenues compared to 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower payroll taxes, insurance and other fringe costs.
Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 9.7% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter to 44.4%.
For Protiviti, gross margin was $96 million in the fourth quarter or 26.5% of Protiviti revenues. This includes $5 million or 1.5% of Protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expenses related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $90 million or 29.7% of Protiviti revenues including $2 million of deferred compensation expense or 0.7% of Protiviti revenues related to investment trust activities.
Company-wide selling, general and administrative costs were 32.6% of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Deferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue to 2.7% in the current third quarter and 1.2% in the same quarter 1 year ago.
Staffing SG&A costs were 39.7% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 36.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 3.7% and 1.5%, respectively. We ended 2020 with 7,800 full-time internal staff in our staffing divisions, down 32% from the prior year.
Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 14.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.1% of revenues in the year ago period. We ended 2020 with 7,300 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 34% from the prior year.
Operating income for the quarter was $89 million. This includes $41 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets. Combined segment income was therefore $130 million in the fourth quarter. Combined segment margin was 9.9%. Fourth quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $79 million with a segment margin of 8.4%. Segment income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter was $51 million with a segment margin of 13.9%.
Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27% for both the current and prior period years. Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable was $714 million and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 49.4 days.
Before we move on to first quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2020 and so far in January 2021, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues down 20.8% versus the prior year compared to a 23.8% decrease for the fourth -- for the full quarter. Revenues in the first 3 weeks of January were down 23% compared to the period -- compared to the same period 1 year ago.
Permanent placement revenues in December were down 25.4% versus December of 2019. This compares to a 28.5% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of January, permanent placement revenues were down 20% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have an insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1.29 billion to $1.37 billion; income per share, $0.74 to $0.84. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 11.7% on an as-adjusted basis including Protiviti and EPS returning to prior year levels. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these assumptions are as follows. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis: staffing, down 19% to 21%; Protiviti, up 23% to 25%; overall, down 11% to 13%.
Gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 37% to 38%; Protiviti, 25% to 26%; overall, 38% to 39%. SG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35% to 36%; Protiviti, 14% to 15%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: staffing, 8% to 9%; Protiviti, 10% to 12%; overall, 8% to 10%.
2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs for the year, $85 million to $95 million with $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter; tax rate, 27% to 28%; shares, 113 million. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

We've retained our key staff, and they are committed to driving our success as the backbone of the enterprise. Our aggressive go-to-market strategy during the pandemic with clients in the public sector and financial institutions of all sizes has yielded meaningful wins and new relationships. Our technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and with our advanced AI-driven capabilities are providing clients with real-time choices of candidates from outside their local market area.
Owing to its diversified solution offerings, Protiviti continues its record of multiyear double-digit revenue growth and very positive pipeline. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing is at an all-time high as evidenced by the 82% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter from the unique blend of consulting and staffing solutions. Staffing services provided to our mid-cap clients now approaches 1/3 of our revenues and growing, and this is incremental to our traditional focus on SMB clients and prospects.
With multiple vaccines now rolling out throughout the world and fiscal and monetary policy support expected to continue globally, economists are increasingly expecting GDP growth to follow. GDP-driven early cycle growth is traditionally particularly robust for SMB clients that are lean and nimble from the downturn and have pent-up demand to restore and upskill their workforce as they return to growth. More than ever, we believe the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model position us for future success in 2021 and beyond.
Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

In the managed solutions with staffing, it's public sector led by unemployment, housing, education, vaccine. FSI continues to lead with anti-money laundering and consumer lending regulatory actions leading that way. Internal audits, down 8% to 10% year-on-year. Some work got delayed. Some scopes got reduced. There's a little bit of fee pressure.
As we've talked about now for a few quarters, Protiviti's pipeline remains very strong. As to which inning we're in, it's clearly not a late inning because not only do we have macro coming back and discretionary spending that will benefit particularly internal audit, you've also got a new administration in the United States that's viewed to be more regulatory friendly, which is a better thing than not as it relates to Protiviti. So we feel great about where they are. We feel great about their prospects, and we feel like it's early innings."

We continue to believe there's upside there. As you know, traditionally, we've been principally SMB. And trust me, we're not walking away from SMB. We're not deemphasizing SMB. To the contrary, we feel like it's the perfect time in the cycle to be SMB, the last couple of quarters that they've been more impacted than mid-cap and beyond. So we've endured the bad side of that, if you will. So now it's time to endure the good side of SMB, and we're excited about how well we can leverage our SMB client base as we've demonstrated in the past.

We service that primarily with contractors, which is why when you look at the supplemental schedules where we break out the intersegment revenues, you see there was a $30 million spike between quarters 3 and 4 and the lion's share of that was public sector related. As to sustainability, the jury is out. That said, we have relationships we've never had before. We've certainly got a look into many local, regional, state governments and their business processes. And we certainly are excited at the opportunity to improve those processes, be it overpayments. A lot in the press about some fraud as it relates to payment of unemployment claims.
And so again, there's no question that there's some spike in that as it relates to elevated unemployment claims that the states are having to process, same for housing assistance, same for remote learning support for school systems. That said, we do believe we're confident, and we've got teams put together whose objective is just what you described as far as ensuring the sustainability and leveraging these new relationships that we've never had. Traditionally, our revenues from government-related entities was less than 1% of revenue. So it was almost nothing. So everything we're doing today is virtually incremental."

Traditionally, we haven't focused there because margin pressures were such that we felt like we were better off offering our better candidates to small businesses that would pay us for them.
But as I said earlier, it's a whole new world when we go hand-in-hand with Protiviti, and it's -- there's the umbrella of an honest to God consulting arrangement with honest to God deliverables such that we do think it's a new day. And clearly, the addressable market is much larger, which is why we're investing. Think about just during the pandemic, our exposure to mid-cap has gone from low 20% to today, it's 34%. That's huge.

Real estate is more nuanced. On the one hand, traditionally, our real estate is very dense. We put a lot of people in our space. There's not a lot of square footage traditionally per person. In today's world of distancing, even post-pandemic query weather, we'll have to relax that somewhat and offset what we'd otherwise save if we're on a hybrid model where everybody doesn't come in every day.
So the jury is out on that. I mean our current thinking is probably more a push than anything. But it's early days, and we don't know. We don't know ultimately how many people are going to want to work remotely versus come in. And further, we don't know whether the density we've traditionally had, which kind of creates an electricity, an energy level in an office, which has been helpful, we don't know whether we're going to have to spread people out more for obvious reasons.
It's kind of interesting. Australia has some of the fewest number of cases. And so I would argue, they're most along post-pandemic, and they've been surprised how much people want to come in and don't want to work remotely. And in fact,  they talk about it's 90% to 95% of the staff want to come back into the office. That surprises me. Whether that's sustainable in Australia itself or whether you can replicate that in other places, I don't know, but that's what they report."

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. 
Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, office teams, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources include their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. 
The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned, also include a revenue schedule showing us information for 2018 through 2021. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. 
We're extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect a broad-based recovery that's well underway. Protiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year, reflecting continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions with staffing. This is Protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains. 
Our staffing operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends led by small and medium-sized businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially. I continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% and from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and down 8% on an as-adjusted basis. 
Net income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter a year ago. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million. In March, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $44 million. 
We also acquired approximately 797,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million. We have 9.2 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Our return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were",1243,"Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days equivalent to the second quarter 1 year ago. 
Currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $17 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the first quarter were $397 million, $316 million of that is from business within the United States and $81 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Productivity revenues up 37%. 
Non-U.S. revenues were up 26% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year productivity revenues by $6 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points. 
Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. We remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or in the case of Protiviti cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. 
Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. 
For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter 1 year ago. 
Our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year ago first quarter to 45.6%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets, as previously mentioned, gross margin for Protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just ended compared to 26.3% 1 year ago. 
Company-wide SG&A costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the first quarter and decreasing SG&A by 2.4% in the same quarter 1 year ago. 
When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% 1 year ago. Staffing SG&A costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the Q1 -- in Q1 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. 
When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 35.3% 1 year ago. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year ago period. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million. This includes $12 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $151 million in the first quarter. Combined segment margin was 10.8%. 
First quarter segment income from our staffing division was $93 million, with a segment margin of 9.3%. Segment income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million with a segment margin of 14.4%. 
Our first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago. The 2020 rate was elevated based upon the estimated lower coverage of nondeductible tax items due to lower pandemic impacted revenues. 
Moving on to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51.4 days. 
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year compared to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter. 
Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were up 9% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in March were up 24.2% versus March of 2020. This compares to an 8.1% decrease for the full quarter. 
For the first 3 weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we've seen during the first quarter and into April. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, and we caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion; income per share, $1 to $1.10. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue increase of 31% on an as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti. Midpoint EPS of $1.05 would represent an all-time high for the company. 
The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 23% to 26%; Protiviti up 47% to 49%; overall, up 30% to 32%. 
On the gross margin percentages, temporary in consultant staffing, 38% to 39%; Protiviti, 27% to 29%; and overall 40% to 41%. SG&A as a percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing, 35% to 37%; Protiviti, 12% to 14%; overall 29% to 30%. And segment income, staffing, 9% to 10%; Protiviti, 14% to 15%; and overall to 11%. 
Full year capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $85 million to $95 million, with $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter. Our tax rate 26% to 27% and shares at $112 million. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter, all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our staffing results accelerated during the quarter, indicating a faster early cycle pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. This was very broad-based and seen across geographies, lines of business, client size and skill levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, small and medium-sized businesses led the way after being more negatively impacted during the peak of the pandemic. The NFIB recently reported that 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill, which was a record level. This bodes well for us. 
Our investments in advanced AI technologies have allowed us to adapt quickly to a new marketplace where remote and hybrid work has become commonplace. Together with our people, these technologies enable us to find solutions to meet their critical talent and consulting needs of our clients across broader resource pools. 
Protiviti continues to thrive with multiyear double-digit growth and a pipeline that is highly diversified across both solution offerings and client segments. Our blended solutions complementing Protiviti's offerings with contract talent, allows us to be extremely nimble and cost-effective in response to client needs, and we expect this offering to be an increasing part of our business going forward. 
We're excited about our current momentum and our prospects for the balance of 2021 and beyond, buoyed by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model. 
We'd also like to thank our employees for making possible 2 recognition awards we've received just in the last few days. These are Fortune's 100 best companies to work for in 2021 and Forbes Best Employers for Diversity 2021. 
Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

Our people would tell you that the recovery feels very classic, that there's improving demand broadly across all the dimensions that I talked about, that, as always, clients cut deep. They've got lean staff, as transaction volumes improve, as projects restart, they need more help. They need to restore their workforce many times upskilled. 
And so for us, it feels very classical. Traditionally, we've got a nice 3- to 5-year runway. Once we get into recovery, which we believe we're well underway as we've spoken about."

And then can you also talk a little bit about what are some of the drivers? You did say it was broad-based, but I'm wondering if you could give us some commentary with regards to the public sector work, the IT work, specs, and obviously, we can see the the results in terms of staffing, in terms of what's being eliminated for the intersegment revenues, so obviously, that continues to go well, but just wondering if you can give us some more color there?"

And so As you said, we're very proud with the 35% growth rate, and it splits pretty evenly between what I'll call core, their core solutions, tech risk and compliance, internal audit, which grew 18% year-on-year, totally exclusive of public sector and blended solutions. Blended solutions then grew 124%, adding 17 points to the growth rate. So you've got 18 points of the growth rate coming from core. You've got 17 points of the growth rate coming from blended solutions. And by the way, those blended solutions then split about 50-50 between public sector and nonpublic sector. So that sizes, if you will, the contribution of public sector. 
If you then look at their core solutions, in tech, which they've been very strategic about picking their shots as to practice areas, they've been very strategic about making the right hires at the right levels, including very senior levels. And so they're in cyber, they're in privacy. They're digital transformation, data analytics. As I've talked before, tech consulting is now the largest core solution area for Protiviti. 
Risk and compliance remains very strong, anti-money laundering, consumer lending regulatory enforcement, our regulator exam preparation, all very good. Internal audit, as you spoke about, clearly benefiting from IPOs and specs. Further, they've got clients reinstating their internal audit budgets that have been cut last year during the pandemic, which also lead to our very aggressive conservatively aggressive, we would call for Q2 with the budget for the guidance. 
The interesting thing about the public sector is it's and blended solutions with staffing generally, it's not just U.S. and that we now have some sizable engagements outside of the U.S., which are contributing. So we're very pleased with that. 
As we've talked before, those public sector engagements are around unemployment, housing assistance, a new and large opportunity we're seeing is in the education space. There's a lot of funding going to K-12 and higher level college level institutions that are going to get a lot of funding that are going to need help, distributing and accounting for those funds. 
We've been pleased about the renewals that we've gotten where we already are, and we're organizing or mobilizing as we speak to take advantage of this education opportunity. So it's one of those times where virtually every core solution area as well as the additional work we're getting in blended solutions not only from public sector, but from nonpublic sector as well, so that we've got a Q2 revenue guide for Protiviti for up 40%."

On the one hand, we compete with them on the other hand, when they're conflicted because of their external audit engagements, we're the first party they refer to because we don't compete with them on external like the other big 4. 
So I'd say our win rate is consistent and rising, particularly in the blended solutions area where they simply don't have the capabilities that we have. And on this issue of sustainability with public sector, and I guess, transitory is a word that our Federal Reserve Chairman likes to use. 
We've been very transparent that clearly there's a bulge dimension to the transaction volumes we're helping with. But we've also been clear that we believe we're building new relationships that we can leverage as they improve their processes, as they improve their controls, as they modernize their technology. 
So we're certainly aware that there's a window of time where we're going to have a very intense relationship with these state and local government and even local school districts, and we're working very hard to extend those. 
We've been very positively surprised or pleased with the extensions we're seeing sometimes into the second and third quarter with this -- the work that we're already doing. So clearly, there's a bulge element to what's going on public sector, but it's not only bulge and we think there's an opportunity. 
And the point I've tried to make is, I know, by the way, totally excluding it, Protiviti is still growing 18%. And so that other 17 points of growth is gravy and we love it, and we think we can leverage it for longer term. But their core business is growing 18%. That's a big number."

And as we talked before, traditionally, in a downturn, peak to trough, we're down 300 basis points. This time, we were only down 100. 
We're now back to prepandemic levels, pay bill spreads have recovered. We've got lower fringe rates because our higher pay rate divisions make up more of our mix, meaning more of the payroll isn't subject to payroll tax. And we've also got this tranche of full-time contractors we've talked about that have higher margins, and that's growing as well. 
Tip to hire conversions, currently 3.1%. They got -- they were 3.5% in 2018, 2019. They've been as high as 4% to 5%. So there's an upside there. We would caution in the short term, like for Q2, Q3, we are projecting some sequential reduction in temp gross margin up to 40 basis points because we've got to pay our temporary contract staff for time off to get their vaccine and time off to recover from that But that's a short-term or hopefully transitory thing. 
On the SG&A front, from a headcount level, given we're still below even 2019, as I just said, we still think we've got capacity with existing staff, which, on average, is more than it's been in the past That said, particularly on perm and replacement because of its very rapid growth rates, to we're going to begin slowly add to internal staff there as well."

And many times, if they don't live in a big city, they live outside of a big city, but they've got an opportunity now to get big city pay without even having to move there. So it's a very nuanced situation with candidates. But the good news is It allows us to add more value because it's more complicated for clients themselves to source candidates, particularly outside their local markets. So the combination of our experienced recruiters and the technology that we've developed, give us an opportunity to add value, I would argue in a new way and an increased way because of all these candidate nuances. I think clients are understanding as they try -- as they always do, to some degree, add people on their own. It's a different world. It's a more complicated world. And I think relative to clients doing it themselves, and relative to our traditional competitors, which are local regional firms, they just don't have the capabilities. They don't have the recruiter relationships, particularly out of market. such that if anything, our competitive positioning is better than ever"

Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources include their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned, also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2018 through 2021.
For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com.
We're extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect a broad-based recovery that's well underway. Protiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year, reflecting continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions with staffing. This is Protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains. Our staffing operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends, led by small and medium-sized businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially.
I continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work.
Company-wide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% and from last year's first quarter on a reported basis and down 8% on an as-adjusted basis.
Net income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter a year ago.
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million. In March, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $44 million. We also acquired approximately 797,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million. We have 9.2 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Our return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

On an as-adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
In the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days, equivalent to the second quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $17 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points.
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the first quarter were $397 million, $316 million of that is from business within the United States and $81 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 37%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 26% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $6 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
We remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, costs of services, with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter 1 year ago.
Our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year ago first quarter to 45.6%.
For Protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets, as previously mentioned, gross margin for Protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just ended compared to 26.3% 1 year ago.
Company-wide SG&A costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the first quarter and decreasing SG&A by 2.4% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% 1 year ago.
Staffing SG&A costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the Q1 -- in Q1 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago.
When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 35.3% 1 year ago. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year ago period.
Operating income for the quarter was $139 million. This includes $12 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $151 million in the first quarter. Combined segment margin was 10.8%.
First quarter segment income from our staffing division was $93 million, with a segment margin of 9.3%. Segment income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million, with a segment margin of 14.4%.
Our first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago. The 2020 rate was elevated based upon the estimated lower coverage of nondeductible tax items due to lower pandemic-impacted revenues.
Moving on to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51.4 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year compared to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter.
Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were up 9% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in March were up 24.2% versus March of 2020. This compares to an 8.1% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared to the same period in 2020.
We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we've seen during the first quarter and into April. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, and we caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues, $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion; income per share, $1 to $1.10. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue increase of 31% on an as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti. Midpoint EPS of $1.05 would represent an all-time high for the company.
The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 23% to 26%; Protiviti up 47% to 49%; overall up 30% to 32%.
On the gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 38% to 39%; Protiviti 27% to 29%; and overall 40% to 41%. SG&A as a percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing 35% to 37%; Protiviti 12% to 14%; overall 29% to 30%.
And segment income, staffing 9% to 10%; Protiviti 14% to 15%; and overall to 11%.
Full year capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs $85 million to $95 million, with $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter.
Our tax rate 26% to 27%, and shares at $112 million.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our staffing results accelerated during the quarter, indicating a faster early cycle pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. This was very broad-based and seen across geographies, lines of business, client size and skill levels. As I mentioned earlier, small and medium-sized businesses led the way after being more negatively impacted during the peak of the pandemic. The NFIB recently reported that 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill, which was a record level. This bodes well for us.
Our investments in advanced AI technologies have allowed us to adapt quickly to a new marketplace where remote and hybrid work has become commonplace. Together with our people, these technologies enable us to find solutions to meet the critical talent and consulting needs of our clients across broader resource pools. Protiviti continues to thrive with multiyear double-digit growth and a pipeline that is highly diversified across both solution offerings and client segments. Our blended solutions complementing Protiviti's offerings with contract talent, allows us to be extremely nimble and cost-effective in response to client needs, and we expect this offering to be an increasing part of our business going forward.
We're excited about our current momentum and our prospects for the balance of 2021 and beyond, buoyed by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model.

Further, if you look at the peak to trough decline, those declines on the temp side are pretty consistent across those 3 cycles.
Our people would tell you that the recovery feels very classic, that there's improving demand broadly across all the dimensions that I talked about, that, as always, clients cut deep. They've got lean staff. As transaction volumes improve, as projects restart, they need more help. They need to restore their workforce, many times, upskilled. And so for us, it feels very classical.

You've got 17 points of the growth rate coming from blended solutions. And by the way, those blended solutions then split about 50-50 between public sector and nonpublic sector. So that sizes, if you will, the contribution of public sector.
If you then look at their core solutions, in tech, which they've been very strategic about picking their shots as to practice areas, they've been very strategic about making the right hires at the right levels, including very senior levels. And so they're in cyber, they're in privacy, they're in digital transformation, data analytics. As I've talked before, tech consulting is now the largest core solution area for Protiviti. Risk and compliance remains very strong, anti-money laundering, consumer lending regulatory enforcement, our regulator exam preparation, all very good. 
Internal audit, as you spoke about, clearly benefiting from IPOs and SPACs. Further, they've got clients reinstating their internal audit budgets that have been cut last year during the pandemic, which also lead to our very aggressive -- conservatively aggressive, we would call, for Q2 with the budget for the guidance.
The interesting thing about the public sector is it's -- in blended solutions with staffing generally, it's not just U.S. in that we now have some sizable engagements outside of the U.S. which are contributing. So we're very pleased with that. As we've talked before, those public sector engagements are around unemployment, housing assistance. A new and large opportunity we're seeing is in the education space. There's a lot of funding going to K-12 and higher-level, college-level institutions that are going to get a lot of funding that are going to need help distributing and accounting for those funds.
We've been pleased about the renewals that we've gotten where we already are, and we're organizing or mobilizing as we speak to take advantage of this education opportunity. So it's one of those times where virtually every core solution area as well as the additional work we're getting in blended solutions not only from public sector, but from nonpublic sector as well, so that we've got a Q2 revenue guide for Protiviti for up 40%."

Can you comment a little bit just on the win rate relative to the Big 4 because I suspect you are continuing to win more, the performance confirm that, number one? And number two, on the public sector, one of the things that we sometimes hear push back on is that the sense is, ""Well, those are just temporary, they're only going to be here for another few months to a year and then they're going to fade."" What's your sense?"

On the one hand, we compete with them; on the other hand, when they're conflicted because of their external audit engagements, we're the first party they refer to because we don't compete with them on external audit like the other Big 4. So I'd say our win rate is consistent and rising, particularly in the blended solutions area where they simply don't have the capabilities that we have.
And on this issue of sustainability with public sector, and I guess, transitory is a word that our Fed Reserve Chairman likes to use. We've been very transparent that clearly there's a bulge dimension to the transaction volumes we're helping with. But we've also been clear that we believe we're building new relationships that we can leverage as they improve their processes, as they improve their controls, as they modernize their technology. So we're certainly aware that there's a window of time where we're going to have a very intense relationship with these state and local government and even local school districts, and we're working very hard to extend those.
We've been very positively surprised or pleased with the extensions we're seeing sometimes into the second and third quarter with this -- the work that we're already doing. So clearly, there's a bulge element to what's going on public sector, but it's not only bulge and we think there's an opportunity. And the point I've tried to make is, and by the way, totally excluding it, Protiviti is still growing 18%. And so that other 17 points of growth is gravy and we love it, and we think we can leverage it for longer term. But their core business is growing 18%. That's a big number."

And as we talked before, traditionally, in a downturn peak to trough we're down 300 basis points. This time, we were only down 100. We're now back to pre-pandemic levels, pay bill spreads have recovered. We've got lower fringe rates because our higher pay rate divisions make up more of our mix, meaning more of the payroll isn't subject to payroll tax. And we've also got this tranche of full-time contractors we've talked about that have higher margins, and that's growing as well.  
Temp-to-hire conversions, currently 3.1%. They got -- they were 3.5% in 2018, 2019. They've been as high as 4% to 5%. So there's some upside there. We would caution in the short term, like for Q2, Q3, we are projecting some sequential reduction in temp gross margin up to 40 basis points because we've got to pay our temporary contract staff for time off to get their vaccine and time off to recover from that if needed. But that's a short-term or, hopefully, transitory thing.
On the SG&A front, from a headcount level, given we're still below even 2019, as I just said, we still think we've got capacity with existing staff, which, on average, is more tenured than it's been in the past. That said, particularly on perm and replacement because of its very rapid growth rates, we're going to begin to slowly add to internal staff there as well."

On the one hand, they're resistant for on-site opportunities either because they're concerned about COVID, they don't like the commute times, they don't have child care, they've got school uncertainty for their children, they've got unemployment benefits.
They've also got out-of-market opportunities as well as local opportunities. And many times, if they don't live in a big city, they live outside of a big city, but they've got an opportunity now to get big city pay without even having to move there. So it's a very nuanced situation with candidates. But the good news is it allows us to add more value because it's more complicated for clients themselves to source candidates, particularly outside their local markets. So the combination of our experienced recruiters and the technology that we've developed, give us an opportunity to add value, I would argue, in a new way and an increased way because of all these candidate nuances.
I think clients are understanding as they try, as they always do to some degree, add people on their own. It's a different world. It's a more complicated world. And I think relative to clients doing it themselves, and relative to our traditional competitors, which are local regional firms, they just don't have the capabilities. They don't have the recruiter relationships, particularly out of market, such that if anything, our competitive positioning is better than ever."

I mean it's been forever the case across the staffing industry that during downturns the previously working temporary employees file a lot of unemployment claims that stay with us for 3 to 5 years as the states average that into their rates. So I'm cautiously optimistic that because the elevated claims that we read about every day by and large haven't been charged to our individual accounts, that the one pool concept will benefit us more than it will hurt us, but only time will tell. I don't know that."

And understand that there's a productivity benefit to us with internal remote work because we no longer have to staff every single office for peak demand but instead, one office can be assisted by a neighboring office or a distant office remotely when they have peak demands. My point is we should be more efficient going forward than we've been in the past because we can share our internal resources across larger areas. So it's not just a matter of because we are recovering, given prior productivity levels, we need X number of staff. As I've also talked about, the average tenure of our existing staff is much longer than normal, which also impacts our need to hire.
So long story short, as you referenced, we're beginning to hire in perm probably a couple of quarters from starting in temp. But even there, it will be at a slower pace than it might otherwise have been because we've got the benefits of remote work. We've got the benefit of our technology tools that we've seen really pay off from us for the last 3 or 4 quarters."

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures that reference these figures as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources includes their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedule, to just mention, also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021. 
For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website, roberthalf.com. 
We achieved record levels of revenues and earnings in the second quarter due to a broad-based global acceleration in demand for our staffing and business consulting services. We were particularly pleased with the strength of our permanent placement and Protiviti operations, which grew year-over-year by 102% and 62%, respectively. Protiviti reached its 15th consecutive quarter of revenue gains with very strong growth in each of its solution areas. I'm extremely proud of our staffing, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who are the key to our success. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.581 billion in the second quarter of 2021, up 43% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 40% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the second quarter was $1.33, increasing 227% compared to $0.41 in the second quarter a year ago. 
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $165 million. In June, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 717,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $63 million. We have 8.4 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 49% in the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

On an as-adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 33% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $855 million, up 34% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $267 million, up 31% on a year-over-year basis as adjusted. 
We have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. In the second quarter, there were 63.4 billing days, unchanged from the same quarter 1 year ago. The current third quarter has 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago. 
Currency exchange rate movements during the second quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $24 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 2.9 percentage points. 
Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 3.7% compared to 1 year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for Q1 2021 was 3.4%. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the second quarter were $459 million, $366 million of that is from business within the United States and $93 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global second quarter Protiviti revenues were up 59% versus the year ago period. The U.S. Protiviti revenues -- with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 63%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. 
Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $8 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. 
Moving on to SG&A presentation. We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. 
For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7 and highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, second quarter gross margin was 39.7% of applicable revenues compared to 37.1% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Our permanent placement revenues in the second quarter were 12.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 8.6% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 490 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter to 47.4%. 
For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 23.4% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effective deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 30% for the quarter just ended versus 25.7% 1 year ago. 
Transitioning to selling, general and administrative costs. Company SG&A costs were 30.9% of global revenues in the second quarter compared to 36.7% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.5% in the current second quarter and increasing SG&A by 3.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 32.9% 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 38.4% of staffing revenues in the second quarter versus 44.2% in the second quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.1% in the second quarter compared to an expense of 5.1% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 39.1% 1 year ago. 
Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 15.1% of revenues in the year ago period. 
Operating income for the quarter was $177 million. This includes $28 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was, therefore, $205 million in the second quarter. Combined segment margin was 12.9%. 
Second quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $125 million, with a segment margin of 11.1%. Segment income for Protiviti in the second quarter was $80 million with a segment margin of 17.4%. Our second quarter tax rate was 27% compared to 20% 1 year ago. The comparative rate in 2020 was lower than normal due to adjustments made to the estimates of the pandemic impact on the 2020 tax rate. 
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $908 million, and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51.6 days. 
Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 34% versus the prior year compared to a 27% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 83% versus June of 2020. This compares to a 97% increase for the full quarter. 
For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 83% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. As you know, these are very brief periods of time. We caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenue, $1.61 billion to $1.69 billion; income per share $1.35 to $1.45. The midpoint of our guidance implies new all-time high revenue and EPS levels for the company. Midpoint revenues of $1.65 billion are 37% higher than 2020 and 5% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. Midpoint EPS of $1.40 is 110% higher than 2020 and 39% higher than 2019.  
The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 33% to 35%, and Protiviti up 46% to 48%, overall up 36% to 38%. Gross margin percentage, temporary and consulting staffing 39% to 40%; and Protiviti, 29% to 31%; overall, 41% to 43%. SG&A as a percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts staffing, 35% to 36%; Protiviti, 12% to 13%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income for staffing, 10% to 11%; Protiviti, 17% to 18%; overall, 12% to 13%, a tax rate of 26% to 27%; and shares outstanding $111.5 million. 
2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs $65 million to $75 million with $15 million to $20 million incurred during the third quarter. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our staffing results continue to reflect a faster pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. Clients have lean staff levels as they begin to expand, which is exacerbated by generally higher levels of attrition. Also, as they look remotely to fill their needs, clients are elevating the experience requirements for their job openings which further adds to the demand for our services. The recovery is also very broad-based and spans across industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. 
The National Federation of Independent Businesses, or NFIB, recently reported that 56% of small businesses had fewer no qualified applicants for open positions and 46% had job openings that cannot be filled. This speaks well to the ongoing demand environment. Protiviti's multiyear record of consecutive growth continues to benefit from a highly diversified suite of solution offerings and client base. 
Blended solutions with staffing, payer Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Protiviti has also benefited from project work in the public sector, resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $100 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. 
Growth in this public sector business contributed 32 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 62%, while the core business accelerated to a growth rate of 30%. Core growth was strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting and business process improvement with internal audit showing the most acceleration. 
Public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 8 points to the company's overall 40% growth rate. A year ago, the world faced an uncertain future with extraordinary challenges ahead. Along the way, we've continued to invest in our tenured high-performing workforce. We also strengthened our investments in advanced AI technologies, enabling our professionals to help clients with critical talent and consulting needs and find solutions across broad resource pools. 
As a result, we closed the quarter with an employee base that is more engaged and productive than ever with all-time high revenues and strong momentum leading into the second half. Bolstered by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model, we're excited about the continued ability to find meaningful and exciting employment for the people we place and provide clients access to the specialized talent they need to grow and the deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete in a dynamic world. 
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us America's best professional recruiting firm. Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

That's only 6% of our overall revenues and added 8 points to our growth rate and at $0.07 a share. It was again led by unemployment and housing assistance. The good news is there's still a backlog of demand. Many states have already extended us into Q3 and 4. 
The tail is expected to last well into 2022. Our forecast is flat for Q3 sequentially and for a modest decline in Q4. So the pipeline for non-transactional RFPs increased eightfold during the last 90 days, projects such as performance improvement, data analytics, controls modernization. So we're cautiously optimistic, that our win rate will be good with those opportunities, given the strength of our new relationships. 
As you mentioned, not only did we grow the public sector portion of intersegment, but we also grew the balance of intersegment, which is managed business solutions, managed technology solutions between staffing and Protiviti. So that grew 49% year-on-year as well that had nothing to do with public sector. So bottom line is the transactional work we are doing has a longer tail than most expect and will likely last well into 2022. We're certainly ramping up a pipeline beyond that and stay tuned to see what our win rate is."

When we talk about candidate supply, it's tightest at the staff or transactional level, but it's manageable.  We've successfully recruited in environments with much lower unemployment rates while currently, it's 5.9% overall and 3.5% are college grads. Just in 2019, it was 3.5% overall and 1.9% for college grads. And frankly, if you adjusted the current rates for participation rates, they'd be even higher. 
I'd say that remote candidates have meaningfully expanded the pool. Our technology, our footprint facilitate this. Further, we do expect some relief at the staff and transactional level as unemployment benefits decline in childcare and schools reopen. We're passing through the wage inflation that we're having, and we've actually expanded our margins some. And clearly, candidates want more remote options and frankly, want a premium if you want them to work on site. But net-net, we think the supply is manageable. And we're not only at the staff and transactional level, but we are mid- and higher-skilled as well, and it's not near as tight there as it is at the staff and transactional level."

And so we measure 4 quarters past trough and we compare that against the '08, '09 and the 2000, 2001 downturns. And so this time, 4 quarters past trough on the tempor contract side, we're up 38%. On the perm side, we're up 96%, and that compares '08,'09 tempor contract up 14, perm up 3. 2000, 2001, temper contract, up 23%, 4 quarters in and perm up 41%. So clearly, it's just a fact that so far, we've recovered more quickly. 
Now further, if you look back to those same periods in time for the '08-'09 period, 3 years hence, we had compound annual growth rates of 12% a year for temp contract and 24% a year for perm and the 2000, 2001 period was frankly double that. And so history would say -- and if anything, it's repeating even better than historically, history would say that once we start recovering, we have a 3- to 5-year runway of outsized growth. And there's nothing that would say otherwise as we sit here. 
In fact, I want to make another structural point which I think is relevant to when we're talking 3 to 5 years, we think this widespread adoption of remote work is a structural win for us. It's more difficult for clients to recruit remotely, particularly our SMBs, which mostly have local footprints. Clients want more experience when they're recruiting remotely because they want to minimize the training requirements from their new hires. We can deliver deeper skills, lower price points when we recruit outside local markets, particularly when we're recruiting for clients in large metro areas. Our competitive position improves, particularly against our tougher local and regional firms. We have a national candidate database with local candidate relationships because of our footprint. 
Our advanced AI matching algorithms provide real-time short list, not only of local candidates, but national candidates for every single job order we get, we give our internal staff a national selection as well as local. Our algos are trained with profiles of our most successful candidates across millions of actual engagements. And furthermore, these multistate candidate administrative requirements that come with remote work, we access through a mobile app, which is the #1 rated in the industry, 4.8 out of 5. And we just processed our 1 millionth time record through that app. 
And quite frankly, our competitors don't have any of that. And then to add further, if you look at our SaaS-based internal infrastructure, that allows our staff to work remotely, it improves their job satisfaction, their productivity, their income potential and allows us to balance our workloads across a much broader geographic area. So I would argue that not only do we have the traditional opportunity as business conditions improve, there's this structural shift to hybrid/remote gives us a lot of advantages we haven't traditionally had."

But -- as we look forward, we think there's an upside with those conversions that have been as high as 4%, and that's all operating margin as well as gross margin. But there's also this mix shift to higher skill levels. And mix is our friend. We get higher gross margins as we move up the skill curve.  
They've been a big part of our margin expansion, if you look back 10 years and our appetite to continue to move up that skill curve, if anything, is greater, which is a great thing for future gross margins. 
Further on the SG&A side, we have new opportunities to leverage, as I just talked about as our people can fill jobs remotely, they all get more productive. We can leverage our technology spend, which has been significant. We can leverage our field infrastructure which is now -- is only now returning back to 2019 levels.

A, we've got a SaaS-based Salesforce.com front office infrastructure; b, we've adopted Workday not only for financials, but for payroll and HR, but financials as well; C, as we've talked about AI before we've spent significantly to create what we think is a competitive advantage by having our matching engine trained based on the profiles of our most successful candidates based on actual work performance across millions of jobs. We're further enhancing that by also trying to predict using data, using activity signals, likelihood to engage because predicting fit is important, but predicting fit and likelihood to engage is more than doubly important. So we'll continue to invest there. 
Our mobile app highly rated, very successful, talked about that. I'd say, at 50,000 feet, we've long talked about this continuum of traditional staffing on the 202 side, talent platforms, self-service driven on the other with the latter giving clients access to our technology, given access to our candidate database, which is second to none for professional-level people. We're still about building out that other side of that continuum. We've made significant progress. We hope in the next few quarters to have at least a minimum viable product ready to go to market there. But our vision is that clients, not we should choose how much they want to interact digitally versus how much they want to interact traditionally. 
And quite frankly, our belief is that while many might first come to us thinking they want to do it digitally self-service, it will ultimately become lead-gen as they find that they need more help closing candidates and therefore, benefiting the traditional side simply by having the talent marketplace, the self-service solution that would be principally digital. It would start is all digital. So we feel great about the technology initiatives, the technology spending, the impact that they've had. I can assure you, we've made tens of thousands of placements on a remote basis using this technology that we simply couldn't have done 5 years ago. So we know it works. We know it's effective.

So if you're in a big city and you recruit outside a big city, there is usually a cost arbitrage benefit to the client. Or if you're looking for really deep skills, you can't find locally, you look outside for that. You're more inclined to use a third party for remote hiring than you are for local market. So all of those things stack on top of each other, which provide for a wonderful environment for perm. 
And by the way, temp and contract benefit as well because many times, during the time it takes to get a full-time person on board, it's a perfect opportunity for temp and contract to sell, ""Hey, we'll give you a person until you make that full-time hire.

As you think about that as a segment of work you've not done a lot in the past, are there any downsides to the public sector as a customer, whether that's funding cycles, anything particular about the work or the profitability? I understand some of that is either directly or indirectly pandemic related and some of that demand will fade at some point.

We've been able to leverage those for -- with state and local groups, so that certainly helps. 
But as a client, we find that particularly at the state level, because they don't really compete with each other, there's a lot of friendly relationships and a lot of friendly referrals from one state to another state.

It's actually better from that standpoint on the public side. But it's a new ground for us. We've been very open about that, but we're optimistic.

And effectively, that's a permanent increase in the productivity level of our people and, therefore, a permanent reduction in SG&A certainly as a percent of revenue. 
So focus on the enterprise we believe that the operating margins we just had this quarter, which I think were 12.9% enterprise, we don't think those are peak. We think we have upside. We think we have gross margin upside as the mix continues to gravitate because it's where we're focused. Up the skill curve, we think there's gross margin upside.

I think the first one, Keith, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your strategies for your own staff retention. In other words, my recollection is that sometimes the best producers in an industry such as yours maybe take the opportunity during very robust periods or when they're marketing -- marketability is the strongest to either, I don't know, hang up their own shingle or they're susceptible to poaching from some of your competitors. 
And I asked this, I guess when I think back about a year ago, I think, Keith, you purposely kind of adopted a very lean staffing strategy at the onset of the pandemic and were comfortable running with lower staff levels. So as we reopen here? I mean, how do you think about the need to kind of retain your best producers to kind of hit your internal targets?"

It brings more clients. It brings more candidates. It brings national candidates as well as local candidates. I mean I can't think of a time where our individual recruiters benefit more by being part of our organization than now, given the technology investments that we've made. They're making more money because we are leaner. We have hockey stick-shaped incentive plans where they get a larger and larger share of the incremental gross margin they produce as they grow their own book of business. So it's a combination of all those things, but I can assure you controlling where they work, given they've proven how productive they can be at home is hugely important in all of the surveys we do with our employee base, which we do often."

And then just to kind of put that in context, when I took labor economics in college, I mean, we were told that the decision to hire people permanently was something that happens as the economic cycle, let's say, matures as opposed to being at an early stage. 
And to me, second quarter of 2021, we're far from a mature stage of the current economic reopening, recovery, rebound, what have you.

But logically, it impacts virtually every client. And to the extent the belief is labor is really tight, you want to -- you want to buy it rather than to lease it for a lack of a better way to say it, and there's all the more incentive for them to hire full-time. 
And two, remember, from a permanent placement standpoint, churn is your friend, and there's a lot of churn as we speak.  Some of which is pent-up attrition because there wasn't much in 2020.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures that reference these figures as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources includes their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021.
For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. We achieved record levels of revenues and earnings in the second quarter due to a broad-based global acceleration in demand for our staffing and business consulting services. We were particularly pleased with the strength of our permanent placement and Protiviti operations, which grew year-over-year by 102% and 62%, respectively. Protiviti reached its 15th consecutive quarter of revenue gains with very strong growth in each of its solution areas. I'm extremely proud of our staffing, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who are the key to our success.
Company-wide revenues were $1.581 billion in the second quarter of 2021, up 43% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 40% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the second quarter was $1.33, increasing 227% compared to $0.41 in the second quarter a year ago.
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $165 million. In June, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 717,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $63 million. We have 8.4 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 49% in the second quarter.

On an as-adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 33% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $855 million, up 34% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $267 million, up 31% on a year-over-year basis as adjusted.
We have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. In the second quarter, there were 63.4 billing days, unchanged from the same quarter 1 year ago. The current third quarter has 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the second quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $24 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 2.9 percentage points.
Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 3.7% compared to 1 year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for Q1 2021 was 3.4%.
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the second quarter were $459 million, $366 million of that is from business within the United States and $93 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global second quarter Protiviti revenues were up 59% versus the year ago period, the U.S. Protiviti revenues -- with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 63%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 43% on an as-adjusted basis.
Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $8 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2.8 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
Moving on to SG&A presentation. We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, second quarter gross margin was 39.7% of applicable revenues compared to 37.1% of applicable revenues in the second quarter 1 year ago. Our permanent placement revenues in the second quarter were 12.8% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 8.6% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 490 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter to 47.4%.
For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 23.4% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effective deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 30% for the quarter just ended versus 25.7% 1 year ago.
Transitioning to selling, general and administrative costs. Company SG&A costs were 30.9% of global revenues in the second quarter compared to 36.7% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.5% in the current second quarter and increasing SG&A by 3.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 32.9% 1 year ago.
Staffing SG&A costs were 38.4% of staffing revenues in the second quarter versus 44.2% in the second quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.1% in the second quarter compared to an expense of 5.1% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 39.1% 1 year ago. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 15.1% of revenues in the year ago period.
Operating income for the quarter was $177 million. This includes $28 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was, therefore, $205 million in the second quarter. Combined segment margin was 12.9%.
Second quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $125 million, with a segment margin of 11.1%. Segment income for Protiviti in the second quarter was $80 million, with a segment margin of 17.4%. Our second quarter tax rate was 27% compared to 20% 1 year ago. The comparative rate in 2020 was lower than normal due to adjustments made to the estimates of the pandemic impact on the 2020 tax rate. At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $908 million, and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51.6 days.
Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues up 34% versus the prior year compared to a 27% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in June were up 83% versus June of 2020. This compares to a 97% increase for the full quarter.
For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 83% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into July. As you know, these are very brief periods of time. We caution against reading too much into them.
With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenue, $1.61 billion to $1.69 billion; income per share $1.35 to $1.45. The midpoint of our guidance implies new all-time high revenue and EPS levels for the company. Midpoint revenues of $1.65 billion are 37% higher than 2020 and 5% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. Midpoint EPS of $1.40 is 110% higher than 2020 and 39% higher than 2019.
The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 33% to 35%; and Protiviti up 46% to 48%; overall up 36% to 38%. Gross margin percentage, temporary and consulting staffing, 39% to 40%; and Protiviti, 29% to 31%; overall, 41% to 43%. SG&A as a percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts staffing, 35% to 36%; Protiviti, 12% to 13%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income for staffing, 10% to 11%; Protiviti, 17% to 18%; overall, 12% to 13%; a tax rate of 26% to 27%; and shares outstanding 111.5 million.
2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs $65 million to $75 million, with $15 million to $20 million incurred during the third quarter. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our staffing results continue to reflect a faster pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. Clients have lean staff levels as they begin to expand, which is exacerbated by generally higher levels of attrition. Also, as they look remotely to fill their needs, clients are elevating the experience requirements for their job openings which further adds to the demand for our services. The recovery is also very broad-based and spans across industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses, or NFIB, recently reported that 56% of small businesses had fewer no qualified applicants for open positions and 46% had job openings that cannot be filled. This speaks well to the ongoing demand environment. Protiviti's multiyear record of consecutive growth continues to benefit from a highly diversified suite of solution offerings and client base.
Blended solutions with staffing, payer Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Protiviti has also benefited from project work in the public sector, resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $100 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share.
Growth in this public sector business contributed 32 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 62%, while the core business accelerated to a growth rate of 30%. Core growth was strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting and business process improvement, with internal audit showing the most acceleration.
Public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 8 points to the company's overall 40% growth rate. A year ago, the world faced an uncertain future with extraordinary challenges ahead. Along the way, we've continued to invest in our tenured high-performing workforce. We also strengthened our investments in advanced AI technologies, enabling our professionals to help clients with critical talent and consulting needs and find solutions across broad resource pools.
As a result, we closed the quarter with an employee base that is more engaged and productive than ever with all-time high revenues and strong momentum leading into the second half. Bolstered by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model, we're excited about the continued ability to find meaningful and exciting employment for the people we place and provide clients access to the specialized talent they need to grow and the deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete in a dynamic world.
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us America's Best Professional Recruiting Firm. Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

That's only 6% of our overall revenues that added 8 points to our growth rate and at $0.07 a share. It was again led by unemployment and housing assistance. The good news is there's still a backlog of demand. Many states have already extended us into Q3 and 4. The tail is expected to last well into 2022. Our forecast is flat for Q3 sequentially and for a modest decline in Q4. So the pipeline for non-transactional RFPs increased eightfold during the last 90 days, projects such as performance improvement, data analytics, controls modernization. So we're cautiously optimistic that our win rate will be good with those opportunities, given the strength of our new relationships.
As you mentioned, not only did we grow the public sector portion of intersegment, but we also grew the balance of intersegment, which is managed business solutions, managed technology solutions between staffing and Protiviti. So that grew 49% year-on-year as well that had nothing to do with public sector.
So bottom line is the transactional work we are doing has a longer tail than most expect and will likely last well into 2022. We're certainly ramping up a pipeline beyond that and stay tuned to see what our win rate is."

When we talk about candidate supply, it's tightest at the staff or transactional level, but it's manageable. We've successfully recruited in environments with much lower unemployment rates while currently, it's 5.9% overall and 3.5% are college grads. Just in 2019, it was 3.5% overall and 1.9% for college grads. And frankly, if you adjusted the current rates for participation rates, they'd be even higher.
I'd say that remote candidates have meaningfully expanded the pool. Our technology, our footprint facilitate this. Further, we do expect some relief at the staff and transactional level as unemployment benefits decline and childcare and schools reopen. We're passing through the wage inflation that we're having, and we've actually expanded our margins some. And clearly, candidates want more remote options and frankly, want a premium if you want them to work on site. But net-net, we think the supply is manageable. And we're not only at the staff and transactional level, but we are mid- and higher-skilled as well, and it's not near as tight there as it is at the staff and transactional level."

So let's first talk about how much faster so far. And so we measure 4 quarters past trough and we compare that against the '08/'09 and the 2000/2001 downturns.

And so we measure 4 quarters past trough and we compare that against the '08/'09 and the 2000/2001 downturns. And so this time, 4 quarters past trough on the tempor contract side, we're up 38%. On the perm side, we're up 96%, and that compares '08/'09 tempor contract up 14%,  perm up 33%. 2000/2001 tempor contract, up 23%, 4 quarters in and perm up 41%. So clearly, it's just a fact that so far, we've recovered more quickly.
Now further, if you look back to those same periods in time for the '08/'09 period, 3 years hence, we had compound annual growth rates of 12% a year for temp contract and 24% a year for perm and the 2000/2001 period was frankly double that. And so history would say -- and if anything, it's repeating even better than historically, history would say that once we start recovering, we have a 3- to 5-year runway of outsized growth. And there's nothing that would say otherwise as we sit here.
In fact, I want to make another structural point which I think is relevant to when we're talking 3 to 5 years. We think this widespread adoption of remote work is a structural win for us. It's more difficult for clients to recruit remotely, particularly our SMBs, which mostly have local footprints. Clients want more experience when they're recruiting remotely because they want to minimize the training requirements from their new hires. We can deliver deeper skills, lower price points when we recruit outside local markets, particularly when we're recruiting for clients in large metro areas. Our competitive position improves, particularly against our tougher local and regional firms. We have a national candidate database with local candidate relationships because of our footprint.
Our advanced AI matching algorithms provide real-time short list, not only of local candidates, but national candidates for every single job order we get, we give our internal staff a national selection as well as local. Our algos are trained with profiles of our most successful candidates across millions of actual engagements. And furthermore, these multistate candidate administrative requirements that come with remote work, we access through a mobile app, which is the #1 rated in the industry, 4.8 out of 5. And we just processed our 1 millionth time record through that app. And quite frankly, our competitors don't have any of that.
And then to add further, if you look at our SaaS-based internal infrastructure, that allows our staff to work remotely, it improves their job satisfaction, their productivity, their income potential and allows us to balance our workloads across a much broader geographic area. So I would argue that not only do we have the traditional opportunity as business conditions improve, there's this structural shift to hybrid/remote gives us a lot of advantages we haven't traditionally had."

And by the way, our contract-to-hire conversions this quarter were 3.4% of revenue, so that was up. But as we look forward, we think there's an upside with those conversions that have been as high as 4%, and that's all operating margin as well as gross margin. But there's also this mix shift to higher skill levels. And mix is our friend. We get higher gross margins as we move up the skill curve. They've been a big part of our margin expansion. If you look back 10 years and our appetite to continue to move up that skill curve, if anything, is greater, which is a great thing for future gross margins.
Further on the SG&A side, we have new opportunities to leverage, as I just talked about as our people can fill jobs remotely, they all get more productive.

We're further enhancing that by also trying to predict using data, using activity signals, likelihood to engage because predicting fit is important, but predicting fit and likelihood to engage is more than doubly important. So we'll continue to invest there.
Our mobile app highly rated, very successful, talked about that. I'd say, at 50,000 feet, we've long talked about this continuum of traditional staffing on the one side, talent platforms, self-service driven on the other with the latter giving clients access to our technology, given access to our candidate database, which is second to none for professional-level people. We're still about building out that other side of that continuum. We've made significant progress. We hope in the next few quarters to have at least a minimum viable product ready to go to market there. But our vision is that clients, not we should choose how much they want to interact digitally versus how much they want to interact traditionally.
And quite frankly, our belief is that while many might first come to us thinking they want to do it digitally self-service, it will ultimately become lead-gen as they find that they need more help closing candidates. And therefore, benefiting the traditional side simply by having the talent marketplace, the self-service solution that would be principally digital. It would start is all digital.
So we feel great about the technology initiatives, the technology spending, the impact that they've had. I can assure you, we've made tens of thousands of placements on a remote basis using this technology that we simply couldn't have done 5 years ago. So we know it works. We know it's effective.

Incremental to that is this higher level of attrition or churn that increases demand. And further, this appetite/need for remote workers makes them less inclined to do it themselves and more inclined to use a third party and why not America's best professional recruiting firm. And so you've got that traditional tranche of lift, you get early cycle that's been added to by the higher attrition and the appetite for remote candidates. So it's been a wonderful thing.

Many times, they have to look outside the current market or want to look outside the current market either, a, for a better price point.
So if you're in a big city and you recruit outside a big city, there is usually a cost arbitrage benefit to the client. Or if you're looking for really deep skills, you can't find locally, you look outside for that. You're more inclined to use a third party for remote hiring than you are for local market. So all of those things stack on top of each other, which provide for a wonderful environment for perm.
And by the way, temp and contract benefit as well because many times, during the time it takes to get a full-time person on board, it's a perfect opportunity for temp and contract to sell, ""Hey, we'll give you a person until you make that full-time hire. And in fact, we'll give you a person you may fall to love with and you will want to hire him full time."" So there's a nice little network effect. And it's the strongest combination we've ever seen. And as I said earlier, we believe this long-term shift to hybrid/remote structurally positions us better than we've ever been positioned vis-à-vis clients doing it themselves or going to our local competitors that don't have any of the capabilities or limited capabilities that I talked about earlier."

We've been able to leverage those for -- with state and local groups, so that certainly helps.
But as a client, we find that particularly at the state level because they don't really compete with each other. There's a lot of friendly relationships and a lot of friendly referrals from one state to another state. And so we found that kind of land and expand where you start with the Controller of State A and you do a good job, they refer you to the Controller for State B and so forth.

It's actually better from that standpoint on the public side. But it's new ground for us. We've been very open about that, but we're optimistic.

So focus on the enterprise, we believe that the operating margins we just had this quarter, which I think were 12.9% enterprise, we don't think those are peak. We think we have upside.

It brings more clients. It brings more candidates. It brings national candidates as well as local candidates. I mean I can't think of a time where our individual recruiters benefit more by being part of our organization than now, given the technology investments that we've made. They're making more money because we are leaner. We have hockey stick-shaped incentive plans where they get a larger and larger share of the incremental gross margin they produce as they grow their own book of business.

And to the extent the belief is labor is really tight, you want to buy it rather than to lease it for a lack of a better way to say it, and there's all the more incentive for them to hire full time.
And two, remember, from a permanent placement standpoint, churn is your friend, and there's a lot of churn as we speak. Some of which is pent-up attrition because there wasn't much in 2020.

The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. We once again achieved a record level of both revenues and earnings in the third quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance and as a result of continued broad-based acceleration in the demand for our staffing and business consulting services. 
Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations continued to show very strong results, growing year-over-year revenues by 79% and 56%, respectively. Our temporary and consultant staffing operations also accelerated in the quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 35%. Overall, our total revenues were 10% higher than the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. I'm very grateful for the notable efforts of our staffing Protiviti and corporate services professionals who've continued to show an outstanding commitment to our success. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.17 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 44% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the third quarter was $1.53, increasing 129% compared to $0.67 in the third quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $225 million. In September,  we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 740,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $75 million. We have 7.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 53% for the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

On an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 38% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $932 million, up 40% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $279 million, up 34% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 321 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the third quarter, there were 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, unchanged from the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $7 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 5.4% compared to 1 year ago adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 3.7%. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, $400 million of this is from business within the United States and $101 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 55% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 54%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 61% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. 
Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. Moving on to SG&A and gross margin presentation. We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. 
This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to GAAP.  
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 40% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the third quarter 1 year ago. Gross margins were positively impacted by expanding pay bill spreads and higher conversion revenues. Our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 12.9% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. 
When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points compared to the year ago third quarter to 47.7%. For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.1% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation changes related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 28.1% 1 year ago. 
Company-wide SG&A costs were 28.9% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to changes in underlying trust investments had the impact of decreasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 0.1% in the current third quarter and increasing SG&A by 1.9% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.9% 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 35.9% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 40.2% in the third quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs were deferred compensation reductions related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets of 0.1% in the third quarter compared to additions of 2.6% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. 
When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36% for the quarter just ended compared to 37.6% 1 year ago. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 12.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 13% of revenues in the 1 year ago period. Operating income for the quarter was $230 million. This includes $2 million of deferred compensation reductions related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $228 million in the third quarter. 
Combined segment margin was 13.3%. Third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $141 million with a segment margin of 11.6%. Segment income for Protiviti in the third quarter was $87 million with a segment margin of 17.3%. Our third quarter tax rate was 25% compared to 26% 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $1 billion and implied days sales outstanding were 52.8 days. 
Before we move on to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 36% versus the prior year compared to a 34% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. 
Permanent placement revenues in September were up 68% versus September of 2020. This compares to a 78% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 62% compared to the same period in 2020.  We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, we use caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.655 billion to $1.735 billion; income per share $1.37 to $1.47; midpoint revenues of $1.695 billion or 30% higher than 2020 and 10% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis; midpoint earnings per share of $1.42, is 69% higher than 2020 and 44% higher than 2019. The  major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 27% to 30%; Protiviti up 34% to 36%; overall up 29% to 31%. Gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 39.5% to 40.5%; Protiviti, 27% to 29%; overall, 41% to 43%. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing, 35.5% to 36.5%; Protiviti, 12.5% to 13.5%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income for staffing, 11% to 12% for Protiviti; 14.5% to 15.5%; overall, 12% to 13%. Tax rate, 25% to 26%; shares $111.2 million. 
2021 capital expenditures and capitalized computing costs, $15 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

The future of work increasingly includes flexible, hybrid and fully remote models, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit in this environment. We can deliver deeper skills and more price point choices to our clients by expanding our candidate searches beyond local markets. We leverage our global office network and our advanced AI-driven technologies to deliver the best candidates for contract or permanent roles regardless of location, all while continuing to deliver the same superior customer experience our clients have come to expect. 
This trend, together with elevated employee attrition rates at clients, has contributed to our staffing results recovering at a faster pace than we've experienced in the past. Our permanent placement and temporary consulting staffing segments, including blended solutions with Protiviti, have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 92% and 50%, respectively, during the first 5 quarters since the trough. 
Similar numbers for the financial crisis and the dot-com recoveries were 41% and 23% and 45% and 31%, respectively. The National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, recently reported that 62% of small businesses had fewer no qualified applicants for open positions and had 51% job openings that could not be filled a 48-year record high. And we are seeing the impact of this on demand for our services on a very broad basis, spanning industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. 
Protiviti continues to excel with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing continues to be a strong differentiator pairing Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Growth remains strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting and business performance improvement. 
Protiviti also continues to benefit from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $110 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. Growth in the public sector contributed 26 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 56%, while the core business maintained a growth rate of 30%, public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 7 points to the company's overall 44% growth rate. 
We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as the recovery continues with strong momentum and as the future of work continues to evolve. As we've done historically, we will continue to invest in our people, our technology, our brands and our business model to strengthen our ability to connect people to meaningful new work and to provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow. 
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees around the world for making possible  another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us one of the World’s Best Employers. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies for our ESG efforts, many of which are outlined in our recently released Corporate Citizenship Report. 
Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

Generally speaking, our higher-level contract practice groups or line of businesses are growing more quickly, they're project-based. The clients are more open to remote work. They're more interested in pinpointing deeper skills that we can access through remote work. So not that they all aren't growing, which they are. It's just that Management Resources and Robert Technology are growing faster. 
You can also see that if you would compare quarter 3 revenues to quarter 3 of 2019, which is pre-pandemic, and you'll see that Management Resources and Robert Half technology have done better than the other divisions for all the reasons I just mentioned."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Protiviti in the guidance. If we take the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like perhaps we might have a slight sequential decline in Q4 relative to Q3. And we've had that before in 2015 and 2016 in terms of going from Q3 to Q4. So not a big deal. But it seems like there's probably some differences going on with regards to sequential trends on the government and public side relative to the private, with the private seeming to accelerate sequentially this last quarter. 
So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, like what are you seeing on that? How are you thinking about public versus private in Protiviti as we go through the near term?"
276703,1685225322,2409411,"Robert Half International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Okay. So we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed the $110 million overall.

So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed the $110 million overall. Of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. So whereas the $172 million total for blended solution contractors, $92 million of that relates to public sector, which is just a little over half. Our expectation is that for the fourth quarter that, that $92 million is down 5% to 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter. The balance of the $172 million, if you will, the other half. And again, while we're talking sequentially, in the third quarter, sequentially, about 80% of the growth in blended solutions overall came from commercial or nonpublic sector engagements.  
And so rather than focus just on the public sector half of our blended solutions, let's think about the whole and the other half, which is nonpublic sector engagements was 80% of the sequential growth. Now as we roll into Q4, as I said earlier, we do expect some moderation, 5% to 10%, as unemployment claims processing moderates. On the other hand, housing and education assistance is growing. We do have a backlog of project work that's not transactional. They tend to be smaller projects, the sales cycle somewhat longer. 
So all of that was figured in when I said we expect down 5% to 10% for the half that is public sector only. The other point I will make is that many of Protiviti's clients have a soft close in the fourth quarter. Many of Protiviti's internal staff take paid time off during the fourth quarter. And so just for time, they expect related to those 2, there's a $14 million sequential revenue impact. And so we've talked many times about December, it's our hardest month to project, both on the staffing side as well as on the Protiviti side because of the impact of downtime, holiday, vacation, whatever you want to call it, soft closes from clients. 
But Protiviti alone with their own staff projects that their revenue impact would be $14 million sequentially from that alone. And so we've been talking about sequentially, but if we talk about year-on-year, Protiviti's comps were the toughest a year ago, much of that was public sector. Together with the impact of soft close paid time off, I think you get to where our projection is for our midpoint. I'll also say this, Protiviti's -- the tone of Protiviti's business has never been better. They are aggressively hiring people across their peering managing directors all the way down to consultants. 
So their issue is not in any way, shape or form demand. It's how quickly can they hire and onboard additional staff. The demand environment, frankly, has rarely been better than what Protiviti sees today."

And the thought is the more routine assignments that we have, to some degree, can be performed, can be delivered from that alternative delivery center, which is just one more alternative that Protiviti has and another price point choice that Protiviti can provide to its clients.

We've successfully recruited at much lower unemployment rates. The current rate for those with a college degree of 2.5% is still well north of the high ones we got back in '18, '19 as an example.  Further, our ability to recruit beyond local markets meaningfully expands the candidate pool. We've taken full advantage of this, particularly in Management Resources and Robert Half Technology. We have a very large percentage of our placements being sourced from people outside the local market where the client is. 
Further, as we've talked about before, we hire people full time and then send them out on assignments as contractors to clients, which is another way we address candidate availability. But when you put all those together, we're cautiously optimistic that we're not going to have a supply issue as it relates to meeting demand. From an inflation standpoint, we're in the mid-5 level. That's not unusual in the early part of a cycle. 
We have a multi-decade track record of passing through our wage inflation. If anything, wage inflation is our friend because we expand our gross margins. As we talked about earlier in Mike's section, we have expanded our gross margins, again, both sequentially and year-on-year. Part of that is conversions, which rose to 3.7% of revenue. And part of that's pay-bill spreads that have widened as well in the presence of that wage inflation. So again, wage inflation is our friend. We think we can manage availability."

There's very little non-pandemic related in there, and it's principally split between unemployment and housing. As we move forward, we have education coming on, that will be very helpful, that we're very bullish about. And it's much more distributed by local school district, and we have hundreds upon hundreds of pre-existing relationships with local school districts. 
But as it relates to non-pandemic assignments with the same pandemic state clients, we have talked about how the backlog has increased dramatically. It increased again this quarter. The sales cycle is different and longer. The procurement process is different. For the pandemic work, we did it pursuant to emergency authorizations, which were quick. For the non-pandemic work, you do it pursuant to blanket purchase agreements. We're happy to report we've secured those for multiple states, including in our largest state client, where we just got a blanket purchase agreement for IT support, virtually anything IT-related. 
So it's early days. The sales cycle is longer. We're bullish that over time, we will net add because of those relationships. But my other point is let's not just focus on the half of our blended solutions that's public sector, let's also focus on the other half. And that other half was 80% of our sequential growth during the third quarter. Public sector was 20% of our sequential growth for this quarter. 
So let's think about both halves, not just the public sector have. As we said, we expect a modest fourth quarter decline, 5% to 10% in public sector. For 2022, we expect further modest declines. We do not expect a cliff decline in public sector across 2022. And  then if we go to that other half of blended solutions, it's growing nicely, very nicely."

And so we're we're being very aggressive there. We do still have some capacity in the other temporary contract practice groups lines of business, if you will.

On a 3-year look back period, that then formed the basis for elevated charges to us for the next 3 to 5 years. What's different this time is that for states to get federal assistance, they had to agree not to charge unemployment claims to specific company accounts. 
Instead, it went into the general account. So the million-dollar question is, are we going to be better off or not to be part of the general pool only rather than being primarily accountable to the individual claims of our former contract employees? And as I sit here today,  my sense is it's going to be a little better, but it's never happened before. And the leisure hospitality has been the lion's share of the unemployment that's gone into that general pool. So we would share in that. So the good news is we won't have to pay for our own claims, but not as good news is we're going to have to share in the leisure hospitality claims that are in the general pool.

For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. 
We once again achieved a record level of both revenues and earnings in the third quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance and as a result of continued broad-based acceleration in the demand for our staffing and business consulting services. Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations continued to show very strong results, growing year-over-year revenues by 79% and 56%, respectively. Our temporary and consultant staffing operations also accelerated in the quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 35%. Overall, our total revenues were 10% higher than the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. I'm very grateful for the notable efforts of our staffing, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who've continued to show an outstanding commitment to our success. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.17 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 44% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the third quarter was $1.53, increasing 129% compared to $0.67 in the third quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $225 million. In September, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 740,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $75 million. We have 7.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 53% for the third quarter.

Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $279 million, up 34% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 321 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the third quarter, there were 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, unchanged from the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $7 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 5.4% compared to 1 year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 3.7%. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $501 million. $400 million of this is from business within the United States, and $101 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 55% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 54%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 61% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. 
Moving on to SG&A and gross margin presentation. We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure. So we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 40% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the third quarter 1 year ago. Gross margins were positively impacted by expanding pay-bill spreads and higher conversion revenues. 
Our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 12.9% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points compared to the year ago third quarter to 47.7%. For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.1% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation changes related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 28.1% 1 year ago. 
Company-wide SG&A costs were 28.9% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to changes in underlying trust investments had the impact of decreasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 0.1% in the current third quarter and increasing SG&A by 1.9% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.9% 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 35.9% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 40.2% in the third quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs were deferred compensation reductions related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets of 0.1% in the third quarter compared to additions of 2.6% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36% for the quarter just ended compared to 37.6% 1 year ago. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 12.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 13% of revenues in the 1 year ago period. 
Operating income for the quarter was $230 million. This includes $2 million of deferred compensation reductions related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $228 million in the third quarter. Combined segment margin was 13.3%. Third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $141 million with a segment margin of 11.6%. Segment income for Protiviti in the third quarter was $87 million with a segment margin of 17.3%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 25% compared to 26% 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $1 billion and implied days sales outstanding were 52.8 days. 
Before we move on to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 36% versus the prior year compared to a 34% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in September were up 68% versus September of 2020. This compares to a 78% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 62% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.655 billion to $1.735 billion; income per share, $1.37 to $1.47. Midpoint revenues of $1.695 billion are 30% higher than 2020 and 10% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. Midpoint earnings per share of $1.42 is 69% higher than 2020 and 44% higher than 2019. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis: staffing, up 27% to 30%; Protiviti, up 34% to 36%; overall, up 29% to 31%. Gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 39.5% to 40.5%; Protiviti, 27% to 29%; overall, 41% to 43%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35.5% to 36.5%; Protiviti, 12.5% to 13.5%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: for staffing, 11% to 12%; for Protiviti, 14.5% to 15.5%; overall, 12% to 13%. Tax rate, 25% to 26%. Shares, 111.2 million. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized computing costs, $15 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

The future of work increasingly includes flexible, hybrid and fully remote models, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit in this environment. We can deliver deeper skills and more price-point choices to our clients by expanding our candidate searches beyond local markets. We leverage our global office network and our advanced AI-driven technologies to deliver the best candidates for contract or permanent roles regardless of location, all while continuing to deliver the same superior customer experience our clients have come to expect. 
This trend, together with elevated employee attrition rates at clients, has contributed to our staffing results recovering at a faster pace than we've experienced in the past. Our permanent placement and temporary consulting staffing segments, including blended solutions with Protiviti, have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 92% and 50%, respectively, during the first 5 quarters since the trough. Similar numbers for the financial crisis and the dot-com recoveries were 41% and 23%, and 45% and 31%, respectively. 
The National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, recently reported that 62% of small businesses had few or no qualified applicants for open positions and had 51% job openings that could not be filled, a 48-year record high. And we are seeing the impact of this on demand for our services on a very broad basis, spanning industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. 
Protiviti continues to excel with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing continues to be a strong differentiator, pairing Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Growth remains strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, and business performance improvement. 
Protiviti also continues to benefit from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $110 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. Growth in the public sector contributed 26 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 56%, while the core business maintained a growth rate of 30%. Public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 7 points to the company's overall 44% growth rate. 
We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as the recovery continues with strong momentum and as the future of work continues to evolve. As we've done historically, we will continue to invest in our people, our technology, our brands and our business model to strengthen our ability to connect people to meaningful new work and to provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow. 
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees around the world for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us one of the World's Best Employers. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for our ESG efforts, many of which are outlined in our recently released Corporate Citizenship Report. 
Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

I think it would be logical to assume we would have perm continuing to outgrow contract consistent with the quarter, consistent with the exit of the quarter and consistent with the post-quarter start to the quarter that we're in. Generally speaking, our higher-level contract practice groups or line of businesses are growing more quickly. They're project-based. The clients are more open to remote work. They're more interested in pinpointing deeper skills that we can access through remote work. So not that they all aren't growing, which they are. It's just that Management Resources and Robert Technology are growing faster. You can also see that if you would compare quarter 3 revenues to quarter 3 of 2019, which is pre-pandemic, and -- you'll see that Management Resources and Robert Half Technology have done better than the other divisions for all the reasons I just mentioned."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Protiviti in the guidance. If we take the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like perhaps we might have a slight sequential decline in Q4 relative to Q3. And we've had that before in 2015 and 2016 in terms of going from Q3 to Q4. So not a big deal but it seems like there's probably some differences going on with regards to sequential trends on the government and public side relative to the private, with the private seeming to accelerate sequentially this last quarter. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. Like what are you seeing on -- how are you thinking about public versus private in Protiviti as we go through the near term?"
276703,1685225322,2409460,"Robert Half International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Okay. So we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall.

So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall. Of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. So -- whereas the $172 million total for blended solution contractors, $92 million of that relates to public sector, which is just a little over half. Our expectation is that for the fourth quarter, that $92 million is down 5% to 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter; the balance of the $172 million, if you will, the other half. And again, while we're talking sequentially, in the third quarter, sequentially, about 80% of the growth in blended solutions overall came from commercial or nonpublic sector engagements. And so rather than focus just on the public sector half of our blended solutions, let's think about the whole and the other half, which is nonpublic sector engagements was 80% of the sequential growth. 
Now as we roll into Q4, as I said earlier, we do expect some moderation, 5% to 10%, as unemployment claims processing moderates. On the other hand, housing and education assistance is growing. We do have a backlog of project work that's not transactional. They tend to be smaller projects, the sales cycle somewhat longer. So all of that was figured in when I said we expect down 5% to 10% for the half. That is public sector only. 
The other point I will make is that many of Protiviti's clients have a soft close in the fourth quarter. Many of Protiviti's internal staff take paid time off during the fourth quarter. And so just for time, they expect related to those 2, there's a $14 million sequential revenue impact. And so we've talked many times about December. It's our hardest month to project, both on the staffing side as well as on the Protiviti side because of the impact of downtime, holiday, vacation, whatever you want to call it, soft closes from clients. But Protiviti alone, with their own staff, projects that their revenue impact would be $14 million sequentially from that alone. And so we've been talking about sequentially, but if we talk about year-on-year, Protiviti's comps were the toughest a year ago. Much of that was public sector. Together with the impact of soft close, paid time off, I think you get to where our projection is for our midpoint. 
I'll also say this. Protiviti's -- the tone of Protiviti's business has never been better. They are aggressively hiring people across their pyramid, meaning managing directors all the way down to consultants. So their issue is not, in any way, shape or form, demand. It's how quickly can they hire and onboard additional staff. The demand environment, frankly, has rarely been better than what Protiviti sees today."

There are just a myriad of accounting and IT-related project demand that are a glove fit for the blended solutions of staffing and Protiviti. The delivery center is intended to be a space -- it's in Ohio. That's a lower cost base where -- and it's also in a lower cost of living area. And the thought is the more routine assignments that we have, to some degree, can be performed, can be delivered from that alternative delivery center, which is just one more alternative that Protiviti has and another price-point choice that Protiviti can provide to its clients.

We've successfully recruited at much lower unemployment rates. The current rate for those with a college degree of 2.5% is still well north of the high ones we got back in '18, '19 as an example. Further, our ability to recruit beyond local markets meaningfully expands the candidate pool. We've taken full advantage of this, particularly in Management Resources and Robert Half Technology. We have a very large percentage of our placements being sourced from people outside the local market where the client is. Further, as we've talked about before, we hire people full-time and then send them out on assignments as contractors to clients, which is another way we address candidate availability. But when you put all those together, we're cautiously optimistic that we're not going to have a supply issue as it relates to meeting demand. 
From an inflation standpoint, we're in the mid-5 level. That's not unusual in the early part of a cycle. We have a multi-decade track record of passing through our wage inflation. If anything, wage inflation is our friend because we expand our gross margins. As we talked about earlier in Mike's section, we have expanded our gross margins, again both sequentially and year-on-year. Part of that is conversions, which rose to 3.7% of revenue. And part of that's pay-bill spreads that have widened as well in the presence of that wage inflation. So again, wage inflation is our friend. We think we can manage availability."

There's very little non-pandemic-related in there, and it's principally split between unemployment and housing. As we move forward, we have education coming on. That will be very helpful. That, we're very bullish about. And it's much more distributed by local school district, and we have hundreds upon hundreds of pre-existing relationships with local school districts. 
But as it relates to non-pandemic assignments with the same pandemic state clients, we have talked about how the backlog has increased dramatically. It increased again this quarter. The sales cycle is different and longer. The procurement process is different. For the pandemic work, we did it pursuant to emergency authorizations, which were quick. For the non-pandemic work, you do it pursuant to blanket purchase agreements. We're happy to report we've secured those for multiple states, including in our largest state client, where we just got a blanket purchase agreement for IT support, virtually anything IT-related. 
So it's early days. The sales cycle is longer. We're bullish that over time, we will net add because of those relationships. But my other point is let's not just focus on the half of our blended solutions that's public sector. Let's also focus on the other half, and that other half was 80% of our sequential growth during the third quarter. Public sector was 20% of our sequential growth for this quarter. So let's think about both halves, not just the public sector half. As we said, we expect a modest fourth quarter decline, 5% to 10% in public sector. For 2022, we expect further modest declines. We do not expect a cliff decline in public sector across 2022. And then if we go to that other half of blended solutions, it's growing nicely, very nicely."

That's something where we get very good margins, where we go up the skill curve in our accounting operations groups. And so we're being very aggressive there. We do still have some capacity in the other temporary contract practice groups lines of business, if you will. And so it will still be a quarter or 2 before we add to that head count.

In prior down cycles, as unemployment claims for people that work temporary/contract for us, their claims got charged to our account. On a 3-year look-back period, that then formed the basis for elevated charges to us for the next 3 to 5 years. What's different this time is that for states to get federal assistance, they had to agree not to charge unemployment claims to specific company accounts. Instead, it went into the general account. 
So the million-dollar question is, are we going to be better off or not to be part of the general pool only rather than being primarily accountable to the individual claims of our former contract employees? And as I sit here today, my sense is it's going to be a little better, but it's never happened before. And the leisure, hospitality has been the lion's share of the unemployment that's gone into that general pool. So we would share in that. So the good news is we won't have to pay for our own claims. The not-as-good news is we're going to have to share in the leisure hospitality claims that are in the general pool. So I said it was going to be esoteric, and I've now just proven it.

For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. 
We once again achieved a record level of both revenues and earnings in the third quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance and as a result of continued broad-based acceleration in the demand for our staffing and business consulting services. Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations continued to show very strong results, growing year-over-year revenues by 79% and 56%, respectively. Our temporary and consultant staffing operations also accelerated in the quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 35%. Overall, our total revenues were 10% higher than the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. I'm very grateful for the notable efforts of our staffing, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who've continued to show an outstanding commitment to our success. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.17 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 44% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the third quarter was $1.53, increasing 129% compared to $0.67 in the third quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $225 million. In September, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 740,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $75 million. We have 7.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 53% for the third quarter.

Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $279 million, up 34% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 321 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the third quarter, there were 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, unchanged from the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $7 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 5.4% compared to 1 year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 3.7%. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $501 million. $400 million of this is from business within the United States, and $101 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 55% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 54%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 61% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.

We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure. So we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 40% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the third quarter 1 year ago. Gross margins were positively impacted by expanding pay-bill spreads and higher conversion revenues. 
Our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 12.9% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points compared to the year ago third quarter to 47.7%. For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.1% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation changes related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 28.1% 1 year ago. 
Company-wide SG&A costs were 28.9% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to changes in underlying trust investments had the impact of decreasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 0.1% in the current third quarter and increasing SG&A by 1.9% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.9% 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 35.9% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 40.2% in the third quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs were deferred compensation reductions related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets of 0.1% in the third quarter compared to additions of 2.6% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36% for the quarter just ended compared to 37.6% 1 year ago. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 12.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 13% of revenues in the 1 year ago period. 
Operating income for the quarter was $230 million. This includes $2 million of deferred compensation reductions related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $228 million in the third quarter. Combined segment margin was 13.3%. Third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $141 million with a segment margin of 11.6%. Segment income for Protiviti in the third quarter was $87 million with a segment margin of 17.3%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 25% compared to 26% 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $1 billion and implied days sales outstanding were 52.8 days. 
Before we move on to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 36% versus the prior year compared to a 34% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in September were up 68% versus September of 2020. This compares to a 78% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 62% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.655 billion to $1.735 billion; income per share, $1.37 to $1.47. Midpoint revenues of $1.695 billion are 30% higher than 2020 and 10% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. Midpoint earnings per share of $1.42 is 69% higher than 2020 and 44% higher than 2019. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis: staffing, up 27% to 30%; Protiviti, up 34% to 36%; overall, up 29% to 31%. Gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 39.5% to 40.5%; Protiviti, 27% to 29%; overall, 41% to 43%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35.5% to 36.5%; Protiviti, 12.5% to 13.5%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: for staffing, 11% to 12%; for Protiviti, 14.5% to 15.5%; overall, 12% to 13%. Tax rate, 25% to 26%. Shares, 111.2 million. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized computing costs, $15 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

The future of work increasingly includes flexible, hybrid and fully remote models, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit in this environment. We can deliver deeper skills and more price-point choices to our clients by expanding our candidate searches beyond local markets. We leverage our global office network and our advanced AI-driven technologies to deliver the best candidates for contract or permanent roles regardless of location, all while continuing to deliver the same superior customer experience our clients have come to expect. 
This trend, together with elevated employee attrition rates at clients, has contributed to our staffing results recovering at a faster pace than we've experienced in the past. Our permanent placement and temporary consulting staffing segments, including blended solutions with Protiviti, have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 92% and 50%, respectively, during the first 5 quarters since the trough. Similar numbers for the financial crisis and the dot-com recoveries were 41% and 23%, and 45% and 31%, respectively. 
The National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, recently reported that 62% of small businesses had few or no qualified applicants for open positions and had 51% job openings that could not be filled, a 48-year record high. And we are seeing the impact of this on demand for our services on a very broad basis, spanning industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. 
Protiviti continues to excel with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing continues to be a strong differentiator, pairing Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Growth remains strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, and business performance improvement. 
Protiviti also continues to benefit from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $110 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. Growth in the public sector contributed 26 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 56%, while the core business maintained a growth rate of 30%. Public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 7 points to the company's overall 44% growth rate. 
We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as the recovery continues with strong momentum and as the future of work continues to evolve. As we've done historically, we will continue to invest in our people, our technology, our brands and our business model to strengthen our ability to connect people to meaningful new work and to provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow. 
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees around the world for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us one of the World's Best Employers. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for our ESG efforts, many of which are outlined in our recently released Corporate Citizenship Report. 
Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

I think it would be logical to assume we would have perm continuing to outgrow contract consistent with the quarter, consistent with the exit of the quarter and consistent with the post-quarter start to the quarter that we're in. Generally speaking, our higher-level contract practice groups or line of businesses are growing more quickly. They're project-based. The clients are more open to remote work. They're more interested in pinpointing deeper skills that we can access through remote work. So not that they all aren't growing, which they are. It's just that Management Resources and Robert Technology are growing faster. You can also see that if you would compare quarter 3 revenues to quarter 3 of 2019, which is pre-pandemic, and -- you'll see that Management Resources and Robert Half Technology have done better than the other divisions for all the reasons I just mentioned."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Protiviti in the guidance. If we take the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like perhaps we might have a slight sequential decline in Q4 relative to Q3. And we've had that before in 2015 and 2016 in terms of going from Q3 to Q4. So not a big deal but it seems like there's probably some differences going on with regards to sequential trends on the government and public side relative to the private, with the private seeming to accelerate sequentially this last quarter. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. Like what are you seeing on -- how are you thinking about public versus private in Protiviti as we go through the near term?"
276703,1685225322,2409471,"Robert Half International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Okay. So we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall.

So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall. Of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. So -- whereas the $172 million total for blended solution contractors, $92 million of that relates to public sector, which is just a little over half. Our expectation is that for the fourth quarter, that $92 million is down 5% to 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter; the balance of the $172 million, if you will, the other half. And again, while we're talking sequentially, in the third quarter, sequentially, about 80% of the growth in blended solutions overall came from commercial or nonpublic sector engagements. And so rather than focus just on the public sector half of our blended solutions, let's think about the whole and the other half, which is nonpublic sector engagements was 80% of the sequential growth. 
Now as we roll into Q4, as I said earlier, we do expect some moderation, 5% to 10%, as unemployment claims processing moderates. On the other hand, housing and education assistance is growing. We do have a backlog of project work that's not transactional. They tend to be smaller projects, the sales cycle somewhat longer. So all of that was figured in when I said we expect down 5% to 10% for the half. That is public sector only. 
The other point I will make is that many of Protiviti's clients have a soft close in the fourth quarter. Many of Protiviti's internal staff take paid time off during the fourth quarter. And so just for time, they expect related to those 2, there's a $14 million sequential revenue impact. And so we've talked many times about December. It's our hardest month to project, both on the staffing side as well as on the Protiviti side because of the impact of downtime, holiday, vacation, whatever you want to call it, soft closes from clients. But Protiviti alone, with their own staff, projects that their revenue impact would be $14 million sequentially from that alone. And so we've been talking about sequentially, but if we talk about year-on-year, Protiviti's comps were the toughest a year ago. Much of that was public sector. Together with the impact of soft close, paid time off, I think you get to where our projection is for our midpoint. 
I'll also say this. Protiviti's -- the tone of Protiviti's business has never been better. They are aggressively hiring people across their pyramid, meaning managing directors all the way down to consultants. So their issue is not, in any way, shape or form, demand. It's how quickly can they hire and onboard additional staff. The demand environment, frankly, has rarely been better than what Protiviti sees today."

There are just a myriad of accounting and IT-related project demand that are a glove fit for the blended solutions of staffing and Protiviti. The delivery center is intended to be a space -- it's in Ohio. That's a lower cost base where -- and it's also in a lower cost of living area. And the thought is the more routine assignments that we have, to some degree, can be performed, can be delivered from that alternative delivery center, which is just one more alternative that Protiviti has and another price-point choice that Protiviti can provide to its clients.

We've successfully recruited at much lower unemployment rates. The current rate for those with a college degree of 2.5% is still well north of the high ones we got back in '18, '19 as an example. Further, our ability to recruit beyond local markets meaningfully expands the candidate pool. We've taken full advantage of this, particularly in Management Resources and Robert Half Technology. We have a very large percentage of our placements being sourced from people outside the local market where the client is. Further, as we've talked about before, we hire people full-time and then send them out on assignments as contractors to clients, which is another way we address candidate availability. But when you put all those together, we're cautiously optimistic that we're not going to have a supply issue as it relates to meeting demand. 
From an inflation standpoint, we're in the mid-5 level. That's not unusual in the early part of a cycle. We have a multi-decade track record of passing through our wage inflation. If anything, wage inflation is our friend because we expand our gross margins. As we talked about earlier in Mike's section, we have expanded our gross margins, again both sequentially and year-on-year. Part of that is conversions, which rose to 3.7% of revenue. And part of that's pay-bill spreads that have widened as well in the presence of that wage inflation. So again, wage inflation is our friend. We think we can manage availability."

There's very little non-pandemic-related in there, and it's principally split between unemployment and housing. As we move forward, we have education coming on. That will be very helpful. That, we're very bullish about. And it's much more distributed by local school district, and we have hundreds upon hundreds of pre-existing relationships with local school districts. 
But as it relates to non-pandemic assignments with the same pandemic state clients, we have talked about how the backlog has increased dramatically. It increased again this quarter. The sales cycle is different and longer. The procurement process is different. For the pandemic work, we did it pursuant to emergency authorizations, which were quick. For the non-pandemic work, you do it pursuant to blanket purchase agreements. We're happy to report we've secured those for multiple states, including in our largest state client, where we just got a blanket purchase agreement for IT support, virtually anything IT-related. 
So it's early days. The sales cycle is longer. We're bullish that over time, we will net add because of those relationships. But my other point is let's not just focus on the half of our blended solutions that's public sector. Let's also focus on the other half, and that other half was 80% of our sequential growth during the third quarter. Public sector was 20% of our sequential growth for this quarter. So let's think about both halves, not just the public sector half. As we said, we expect a modest fourth quarter decline, 5% to 10% in public sector. For 2022, we expect further modest declines. We do not expect a cliff decline in public sector across 2022. And then if we go to that other half of blended solutions, it's growing nicely, very nicely."

That's something where we get very good margins, where we go up the skill curve in our accounting operations groups. And so we're being very aggressive there. We do still have some capacity in the other temporary contract practice groups lines of business, if you will. And so it will still be a quarter or 2 before we add to that head count.

In prior down cycles, as unemployment claims for people that work temporary/contract for us, their claims got charged to our account. On a 3-year look-back period, that then formed the basis for elevated charges to us for the next 3 to 5 years. What's different this time is that for states to get federal assistance, they had to agree not to charge unemployment claims to specific company accounts. Instead, it went into the general account. 
So the million-dollar question is, are we going to be better off or not to be part of the general pool only rather than being primarily accountable to the individual claims of our former contract employees? And as I sit here today, my sense is it's going to be a little better, but it's never happened before. And the leisure, hospitality has been the lion's share of the unemployment that's gone into that general pool. So we would share in that. So the good news is we won't have to pay for our own claims. The not-as-good news is we're going to have to share in the leisure hospitality claims that are in the general pool. So I said it was going to be esoteric, and I've now just proven it.

Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources includes their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021. 
For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com. 
We once again achieved a record level of both revenues and earnings in the third quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance and as a result of continued broad-based acceleration in the demand for our staffing and business consulting services. Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations continued to show very strong results, growing year-over-year revenues by 79% and 56%, respectively. Our temporary and consultant staffing operations also accelerated in the quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 35%. Overall, our total revenues were 10% higher than the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. I'm very grateful for the notable efforts of our staffing, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who've continued to show an outstanding commitment to our success. 
Company-wide revenues were $1.17 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 44% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the third quarter was $1.53, increasing 129% compared to $0.67 in the third quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $225 million. In September, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. We also acquired approximately 740,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $75 million. We have 7.7 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 53% for the third quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley."

As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.713 billion in the third quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 38% year-over-year.

On an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 38% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $932 million, up 40% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $279 million, up 34% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 321 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
In the third quarter, there were 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 in the same quarter 1 year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, unchanged from the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $7 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 5.4% compared to 1 year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. This rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 3.7%. 
Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $501 million. $400 million of this is from business within the United States, and $101 million is from operations outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 55% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 54%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 61% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. 
Moving on to SG&A and gross margin presentation. We remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure. So we also show a reconciliation to GAAP. 
Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 40% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the third quarter 1 year ago. Gross margins were positively impacted by expanding pay-bill spreads and higher conversion revenues. 
Our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 12.9% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points compared to the year ago third quarter to 47.7%. For Protiviti, gross margin was 29.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.1% of Protiviti revenues 1 year ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation changes related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for Protiviti was 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 28.1% 1 year ago. 
Company-wide SG&A costs were 28.9% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to changes in underlying trust investments had the impact of decreasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 0.1% in the current third quarter and increasing SG&A by 1.9% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.9% 1 year ago. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 35.9% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 40.2% in the third quarter of 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs were deferred compensation reductions related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets of 0.1% in the third quarter compared to additions of 2.6% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36% for the quarter just ended compared to 37.6% 1 year ago. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 12.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 13% of revenues in the 1 year ago period. 
Operating income for the quarter was $230 million. This includes $2 million of deferred compensation reductions related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was therefore $228 million in the third quarter. Combined segment margin was 13.3%. Third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $141 million with a segment margin of 11.6%. Segment income for Protiviti in the third quarter was $87 million with a segment margin of 17.3%. 
Our third quarter tax rate was 25% compared to 26% 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $1 billion and implied days sales outstanding were 52.8 days. 
Before we move on to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 36% versus the prior year compared to a 34% increase for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of October were up 35% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in September were up 68% versus September of 2020. This compares to a 78% increase for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 62% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October. But as you know, these are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them. 
With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.655 billion to $1.735 billion; income per share, $1.37 to $1.47. Midpoint revenues of $1.695 billion are 30% higher than 2020 and 10% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. Midpoint earnings per share of $1.42 is 69% higher than 2020 and 44% higher than 2019. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis: staffing, up 27% to 30%; Protiviti, up 34% to 36%; overall, up 29% to 31%. Gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 39.5% to 40.5%; Protiviti, 27% to 29%; overall, 41% to 43%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35.5% to 36.5%; Protiviti, 12.5% to 13.5%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: for staffing, 11% to 12%; for Protiviti, 14.5% to 15.5%; overall, 12% to 13%. Tax rate, 25% to 26%. Shares, 111.2 million. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized computing costs, $15 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. 
We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

The future of work increasingly includes flexible, hybrid and fully remote models, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit in this environment. We can deliver deeper skills and more price-point choices to our clients by expanding our candidate searches beyond local markets. We leverage our global office network and our advanced AI-driven technologies to deliver the best candidates for contract or permanent roles regardless of location, all while continuing to deliver the same superior customer experience our clients have come to expect. 
This trend, together with elevated employee attrition rates at clients, has contributed to our staffing results recovering at a faster pace than we've experienced in the past. Our permanent placement and temporary consulting staffing segments, including blended solutions with Protiviti, have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 92% and 50%, respectively, during the first 5 quarters since the trough. Similar numbers for the financial crisis and the dot-com recoveries were 41% and 23%, and 45% and 31%, respectively. 
The National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, recently reported that 62% of small businesses had few or no qualified applicants for open positions and had 51% job openings that could not be filled, a 48-year record high. And we are seeing the impact of this on demand for our services on a very broad basis, spanning industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. 
Protiviti continues to excel with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing continues to be a strong differentiator, pairing Protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. Growth remains strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, and business performance improvement. 
Protiviti also continues to benefit from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. Approximately $110 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. Growth in the public sector contributed 26 points to Protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 56%, while the core business maintained a growth rate of 30%. Public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 7 points to the company's overall 44% growth rate. 
We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as the recovery continues with strong momentum and as the future of work continues to evolve. As we've done historically, we will continue to invest in our people, our technology, our brands and our business model to strengthen our ability to connect people to meaningful new work and to provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow. 
Finally, we'd like to thank our employees around the world for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as Forbes named us one of the World's Best Employers. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for our ESG efforts, many of which are outlined in our recently released Corporate Citizenship Report. 
Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions."

I think it would be logical to assume we would have perm continuing to outgrow contract consistent with the quarter, consistent with the exit of the quarter and consistent with the post-quarter start to the quarter that we're in. Generally speaking, our higher-level contract practice groups or line of businesses are growing more quickly. They're project-based. The clients are more open to remote work. They're more interested in pinpointing deeper skills that we can access through remote work. So not that they all aren't growing, which they are. It's just that Management Resources and Robert Technology are growing faster. You can also see that if you would compare quarter 3 revenues to quarter 3 of 2019, which is pre-pandemic, and -- you'll see that Management Resources and Robert Half Technology have done better than the other divisions for all the reasons I just mentioned."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Protiviti in the guidance. If we take the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like perhaps we might have a slight sequential decline in Q4 relative to Q3. And we've had that before in 2015 and 2016 in terms of going from Q3 to Q4. So not a big deal but it seems like there's probably some differences going on with regards to sequential trends on the government and public side relative to the private, with the private seeming to accelerate sequentially this last quarter. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. Like what are you seeing on -- how are you thinking about public versus private in Protiviti as we go through the near term?"
276703,1685225322,2409473,"Robert Half International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Okay. So we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall. Of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. So -- whereas the $1",472,"Okay. So we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. So first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. We disclosed $110 million overall. Of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. So -- whereas the $172 million total for blended solution contractors, $92 million of that relates to public sector, which is just a little over half. Our expectation is that for the fourth quarter, that $92 million is down 5% to 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter; the balance of the $172 million, if you will, the other half. And again, while we're talking sequentially, in the third quarter, sequentially, about 80% of the growth in blended solutions overall came from commercial or nonpublic sector engagements. And so rather than focus just on the public sector half of our blended solutions, let's think about the whole and the other half, which is nonpublic sector engagements was 80% of the sequential growth. 
Now as we roll into Q4, as I said earlier, we do expect some moderation, 5% to 10%, as unemployment claims processing moderates. On the other hand, housing and education assistance is growing. We do have a backlog of project work that's not transactional. They tend to be smaller projects, the sales cycle somewhat longer. So all of that was figured in when I said we expect down 5% to 10% for the half. That is public sector only. 
The other point I will make is that many of Protiviti's clients have a soft close in the fourth quarter. Many of Protiviti's internal staff take paid time off during the fourth quarter. And so just for time, they expect related to those 2, there's a $14 million sequential revenue impact. And so we've talked many times about December. It's our hardest month to project, both on the staffing side as well as on the Protiviti side because of the impact of downtime, holiday, vacation, whatever you want to call it, soft closes from clients. But Protiviti alone, with their own staff, projects that their revenue impact would be $14 million sequentially from that alone. And so we've been talking about sequentially, but if we talk about year-on-year, Protiviti's comps were the toughest a year ago. Much of that was public sector. Together with the impact of soft close, paid time off, I think you get to where our projection is for our midpoint. 
I'll also say this. Protiviti's -- the tone of Protiviti's business has never been better. They are aggressively hiring people across their pyramid, meaning managing directors all the way down to consultants. So their issue is not, in any way, shape or form, demand. It's how quickly can they hire and onboard additional staff. The demand environment, frankly, has rarely been better than what Protiviti sees today."

There are just a myriad of accounting and IT-related project demand that are a glove fit for the blended solutions of staffing and Protiviti. The delivery center is intended to be a space -- it's in Ohio. That's a lower cost base where -- and it's also in a lower cost of living area. And the thought is the more routine assignments that we have, to some degree, can be performed, can be delivered from that alternative delivery center, which is just one more alternative that Protiviti has and another price-point choice that Protiviti can provide to its clients.

We've successfully recruited at much lower unemployment rates. The current rate for those with a college degree of 2.5% is still well north of the high ones we got back in '18, '19 as an example. Further, our ability to recruit beyond local markets meaningfully expands the candidate pool. We've taken full advantage of this, particularly in Management Resources and Robert Half Technology. We have a very large percentage of our placements being sourced from people outside the local market where the client is. Further, as we've talked about before, we hire people full-time and then send them out on assignments as contractors to clients, which is another way we address candidate availability. But when you put all those together, we're cautiously optimistic that we're not going to have a supply issue as it relates to meeting demand. 
From an inflation standpoint, we're in the mid-5 level. That's not unusual in the early part of a cycle. We have a multi-decade track record of passing through our wage inflation. If anything, wage inflation is our friend because we expand our gross margins. As we talked about earlier in Mike's section, we have expanded our gross margins, again both sequentially and year-on-year. Part of that is conversions, which rose to 3.7% of revenue. And part of that's pay-bill spreads that have widened as well in the presence of that wage inflation. So again, wage inflation is our friend. We think we can manage availability."

As I said earlier, we think this remote hybrid work, the future of work, improves our competitive position significantly. Our clients themselves have a much harder time recruiting for their own account remotely. Our competitors that, by and large, are local and regional don't have the office network, don't have the local candidate relationships, don't have the technology. And so we're very bullish, and we're very pleased at the investments we've made in network, in people, in technology. All come together in a beneficial way for us vis-a-vis our competitors as we move forward, which make us very bullish as we move forward in this cycle."

When you first began discussing this, I guess, over a year ago, the initial focus was on the pandemic created these opportunities and you've alluded a couple of times. Do you think that the relationships you see are creating maybe non-pandemic, longer-term, more durable opportunities? Can you just give us any color on that? Like what's the mix of stuff that you think is pretty much directly pandemic-related versus not? Or how do the pipelines longer term -- and I'm obviously not asking about Q4 but thinking into '22 or over time as you think about that opportunity."

There's very little non-pandemic-related in there, and it's principally split between unemployment and housing. As we move forward, we have education coming on. That will be very helpful. That, we're very bullish about. And it's much more distributed by local school district, and we have hundreds upon hundreds of pre-existing relationships with local school districts. 
But as it relates to non-pandemic assignments with the same pandemic state clients, we have talked about how the backlog has increased dramatically. It increased again this quarter. The sales cycle is different and longer. The procurement process is different. For the pandemic work, we did it pursuant to emergency authorizations, which were quick. For the non-pandemic work, you do it pursuant to blanket purchase agreements. We're happy to report we've secured those for multiple states, including in our largest state client, where we just got a blanket purchase agreement for IT support, virtually anything IT-related. 
So it's early days. The sales cycle is longer. We're bullish that over time, we will net add because of those relationships. But my other point is let's not just focus on the half of our blended solutions that's public sector. Let's also focus on the other half, and that other half was 80% of our sequential growth during the third quarter. Public sector was 20% of our sequential growth for this quarter. So let's think about both halves, not just the public sector half. As we said, we expect a modest fourth quarter decline, 5% to 10% in public sector. For 2022, we expect further modest declines. We do not expect a cliff decline in public sector across 2022. And then if we go to that other half of blended solutions, it's growing nicely, very nicely."

I'd say we have the least capacity and are the most aggressive adding to staff and permanent placement. The growth rates speak for themselves. The cumulative progress off the trough speaks for itself. So we're aggressively adding permanent placement recruiters as we speak. We're also adding recruiters to this full-time contractor segment where we hire people full-time. We put them out as contractors. That's something where we get very good margins, where we go up the skill curve in our accounting operations groups. And so we're being very aggressive there. We do still have some capacity in the other temporary contract practice groups lines of business, if you will. And so it will still be a quarter or 2 before we add to that head count. But when you put all the adds together, it's not going to be disproportionate to the revenue growth. So I wouldn't expect negative leverage. It will just be -- it will be just less positive leverage."

Typically, for us, for a 3- to 5-year period, we would see mid-single-digit wage inflation that we would pass through and, in fact, expand our margins a bit. The only thing that's new this time that makes for interesting thought is this notion that we're going to place nonlocal candidates into local clients. And some of that's done as a labor arbitrage, better price point. Other times, it's done so you can get a more pinpointed, deeper skill. But potentially, that could take some pressure off wage inflation. But again, wage inflation is our friend. It's not something we fear, and we'll let the game come to us.

In prior down cycles, as unemployment claims for people that work temporary/contract for us, their claims got charged to our account. On a 3-year look-back period, that then formed the basis for elevated charges to us for the next 3 to 5 years. What's different this time is that for states to get federal assistance, they had to agree not to charge unemployment claims to specific company accounts. Instead, it went into the general account. 
So the million-dollar question is, are we going to be better off or not to be part of the general pool only rather than being primarily accountable to the individual claims of our former contract employees? And as I sit here today, my sense is it's going to be a little better, but it's never happened before. And the leisure, hospitality has been the lion's share of the unemployment that's gone into that general pool. So we would share in that. So the good news is we won't have to pay for our own claims. The not-as-good news is we're going to have to share in the leisure hospitality claims that are in the general pool. So I said it was going to be esoteric, and I've now just proven it. But it was a long-winded way of saying I think it's going to be better but I don't think it's going to be dramatically different."
