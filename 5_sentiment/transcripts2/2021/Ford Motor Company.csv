Last year was like no other with COVID dramatically and tragically affecting all of us. But tough times can bring out the best in people, and boy was that true at Ford. I'm really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis. We harnessed our capabilities, and we developed a lot of new ones. Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work, but also to make life-saving equipment. 
And I'd like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new finished strong initiative, to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control. To date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks. And by midyear, we will have donated 100 million masks. In partnership with the UAW, we've also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns. 
More to the point of today's call, we relied on the same grid and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances. We improved our execution while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming forward into a far stronger company. A company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences. 
After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year's shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuild our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand. In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched 3 incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction. Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and more importantly, others believe is the first credible mass market competitor to Tesla. And the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America's favorite vehicle, it's now connected. You can sleep in it, you can work in it. It's incredibly capable, and it is such a fantastic product. 
And the Banco Sport. The first member of our reimagined legend dairy Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career. Now as we recap last year's results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan. Simply put, we're seeing real improvements in our core automotive business, and we are laser-focused on further progress this year. 
Now this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit. We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value to achieve that we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must have products and services and rewarding customer experiences. We're moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses. 
We will start to grow again, but most importantly, in the right areas. Allocating more capital; resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups; commercial vehicles and utilities; being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale; expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue; and incubating, then scaling than integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI's world-class self-driving system. 
Today, I'll touch on a few of our plan highlights with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity. Back in 2017, vehicle lines that accounted for just 60% of our company's revenue generated 150% of our EBIT, and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital. This imbalances simply not sustainable. And we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business. We allocated capital to our strengths. We underperforming assets. We created a more focused portfolio and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford. 
We've already made a tremendous progress. Through last year, we've invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint. In the first phase of a redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the #1 vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that built our brand and make a solid return. 
We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe. We reduced regional headcount by 20%. We lowered our annual structure cost by $1.1 billion through last year. And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than 4 years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Let's turn to South America. We've lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable. In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region. We discontinued focus on Fiesta. And we further reduced headcount, in fact by more than 40% through the end of last year. 
And with these actions, last year, we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. And then in early January, we went further. As Ford Brazil announced it would end production and close 3 facilities, that decision will derisk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports. We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting connected and increasingly electrified pickups, including this amazing new Ranger and commercial vehicles, sourced in Argentina and Uruguay and other markets. 
Now we didn't take these actions lightly. And Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions. At the same time, we know they were right and necessary. And we're optimistic about our new business model for South America. Now before John walks through the last year's results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford's connectivity and electrification plans. 
2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford. We have hundreds of thousands of fully network vehicles now in the field. And now we're seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data, streaming off those vehicles and also use our over there updates to improve quality and revolutionize the for customer experience. And importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers. We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford Commercial Services, and we are just starting. 
Ford's development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new 6-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week. The 2 companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call team upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system. The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team's ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide forward with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company. 
Now as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world. We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale. It's early in the transition, but the trend is clear. We watched 1 out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December, be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow, and the reality is that customers, including in the U.S., are increasingly giving e-mobility greater consideration. We have no intention to see ground to other in vehicle segments where Ford is the established leader. 
We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities. We're also increasing financial flexibility so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers. Now the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year, embodies how we lead in electric vehicles. It's on sale now. It has stunning design. It is a fully connected and ready for the updates with a tremendous technology experience. 
It's delivering high-quality, exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s. It's a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric. And there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming in. As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles. And we're on the leading edge of the electric revolution there too. We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck. With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has 3 different lengths, 3 different heights. We have a van, a strip chassis and a cutaway, and there's more coming on E-Transit. And then we're going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year. 
In a recent study by Cox Automotive, they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups are coming to the market. Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan. We understand the needs of these customers. We're going to offer a wide variety of configurations that I mentioned, and we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them, connect -- to services. For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a Transit is 74 miles. And they do not overbuy batteries. 
We validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers. Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over the alerts. So when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for 100% uptime, we can do that. That stays on the road, working, where it belongs. Those are just 2 of dozens of examples of how we're employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time, creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford. 
The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicles interiors, digital experiences, ease service networks to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost. These are very sticky annuity-like capabilities that remove pain points and create opportunities for our customers. No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and and introduce services like these at scale. We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan. 
We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025, and that's just electrification. When you include the spending on autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion. The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners. This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production, whether alone or in a JV. 
As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing. So far, we're busy, and we're included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150. We're building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit. Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs. And in China and Quatela, Mexico for the Mach-E, and there's a lot more to come. Our team is busy. Thanks for your time and attention. And as you can hear, I'm very excited about our future. John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year. Over to you, John."

So when you analyze our fourth quarter results or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business increasingly positione",1726,"Thanks, Jim. So when you analyze our fourth quarter results or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow. 
Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion, provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest in growth and even accelerate investments if we choose to in key areas like electrification and connected services. And at our 8% company adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we're aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth. And when we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy. 
EV penetration at scale was years out. Connectivity and digital services were still nascent. And autonomous vehicles will -- they were still largely in labs. So you fast forward to 2021, and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital. Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and in doing so, to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value. 
So let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance. In automotive, both wholesales and revenue declined by 9%. While a lower industry influence both of these metrics, so did the plan changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150. Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number. 
Fourth quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe. Let's take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America. The North American business offset some of its decline in top line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles. Together, volume and revenue of Transit and super duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively. With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we're building every vehicle we can. EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%. 
This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost in the fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned. In South America, wholesale and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and forward share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths and arranger pickups, Transit van and key imports. 
On a full year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%. Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale, as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures. As Jim mentioned, in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the focus in Fiesta and further reduced headcount in total by more than 40% through the end of 2020. These actions and other actions that we've been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT. We posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. 
With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally derisked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign. Shifting to Europe. Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes. However, Ford's revenue in the region was up modestly, aided by higher net pricing and improved mix. Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its #1 position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points. Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated Transit centers. 
And during the quarter, the commercial passenger and in-part vehicle businesses were all profitable. And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced, along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last 2 years, allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in 4 years with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. 
Now turning to China. China delivered a 27% increase in wholesale. Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%. Ford share in China grew by 4 basis points to 2.4%, with a 12-point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%. The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter, supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles. Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive. 
Now while it's still a modest EBIT loss, this was China's third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement, aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally built Lincoln products. The China specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brands in-country retail sales. That's up from just 2% last year. Wholesales and revenue results for the International Market Group varied, but a retail sales increase of 1.8%, countered an industry decline of 3%. 
IMG continues to capitalize on its strength in Ranger pickups and SUVs, and  Ranger was the best-selling 4x4 pickup in Australia. Now just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe. This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and  profitably grow this important business for us. 
Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter, led by Australia and Vietnam. In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture. This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic. While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India. 
Turning to Mobility. We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020. Our plans include standing up a commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods. And we also believe that Argo AI self-driving system remains on a short list of leaders in the autonomous technology. With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative loads of transportation. 
In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits that applied for in the U.S. in municipalities last year. Now let's turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter. Improved auction values drove the performance, and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss to receivables ratio. 
All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points. Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I'm incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year. 
So let's turn to 2021. The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid, and we're evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real time. We want to be transparent and also prudent. Therefore, we think it's premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full year results. That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change and the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time. 
For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million noncash gain on our investment in Rivian. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year. We anticipate ability to be flat and forward credit EBT to improve. We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. 
However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year. The situation is changing constantly. So it's premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full year results. However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first quarter production. 
If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year. So we should expect full year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile, given the mechanics of the company's working capital. 
So our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations. For example, similar to other actions we've already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn truck plant in Kansas City assembly plant. These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first quarter volume that I just mentioned. 
We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first quarter 2021 financial results, and that's on April 28. So before we open the call to Q&A., I will end where Jim began. It cannot be overstated. 2020 was a year like no other. No other in our lifetimes. The Ford team responded exceptionally, both personally and professionally. We're exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world. 
We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows. And that financial flexibility will allow us to make the right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation."

I know you have a lot of confidence in these vehicles. But are there any objective measures that you can share with investors as to why they should also be confident in the profit contribution of these models? 
So I know it's early days. But do you have any anecdotes about how quickly the vehicles are turning on dealer lots? How the pricing has been trending for the new F-150, with the earlier customer reaction has been to the Mach-E, you're doing a lot of test drives? And I realize the Bronco still has yet to even launch. So maybe there are fewer metrics there.

Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics, we see it give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time. That's one thing. So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year. We're starting the year with 53 days supply. The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model. 
So plus mix is extremely strong. You also look at the super duty demand. Super duty was up 14%. It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger. And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in 6 days, the F-150. 
If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far. We have -- about 70% of the customers are new to Ford. So we have new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years. The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E class. We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders. High all-wheel drive mix more than we thought. The extended battery is much more popular than we expected. And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that are each were $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side. 
So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E. On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like 6 days. We sold every 1 we wholesale to dealers in the fourth quarter. I think we sold over 5,000. It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan. And I would say the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders. 
The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest. Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought. It's encouraging to see the 1/3. But the is very, very strong mix. And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong. And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January. I think we passed 8,000 units. 
So I mean -- and that's a brand-new model to our lineup. So that gives you a picture for the demand side. And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of performance?"

We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year. 
And we're really transforming the team as well. We're bringing in new talent. We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services. And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting. So I think there's a lot of good things going on here."

I watched the market really carefully in Europe and 10% in December. Pure battery electric is amazing. Our time is now at Ford. We're not talking about aspirations. We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that. 
This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-Es in the market now. We think it's a real competitor to Tesla and their stronghold part of their price market. The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers. We sold 780,000 F-150s last year. We are going to find, and we are finding, within that, a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers. It's such a large scale. 
In Transit electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high. This is our turf. And we're not just going to have 1 delivery vehicle. We're going to have 3 lengths, 2-wheel bases, 3 roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van and we're not done. So we are the leader in the Transit business. We have the body builder connections. 100% of our transits get updated. And we know every one of those of So -- and we are getting more inbound for that. 
So how do we manage move? I think it's a really good question. I don't know if any of us have the answer. The costs are coming down quickly. But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors. It's about a digital vehicle and a new customer experience. And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about, we have 130,000 commercial solution customers now. We have 9 million Ford pass customers, that is universal. 
So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business. We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible. And we'll invest in both. And we'll flex with the customers. So I think we're ready. This is our year. We're going to have great offers. And I think it's really on us. The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year. It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or 2 after we launch it with the same customer."

And yes, we do see them being profitable. In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the marquee. So it's going to transition over time. We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles. 
We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus we have from a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EVs. As Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV. We're focused on expanding that growth. We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles. And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? 
These are segments that we lead-in. There's a strong customer base. And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles. There's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles.

This accelerated spending on products and industrializing those products. And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions. We just don't have anything announced today. We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have 2 battery electric dedicated platforms. They will include high-volume passenger cars. But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest. 
And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are. And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles. And as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work. We've learned over all these years that Ford strength in commercial is far beyond the product. In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is. 
Our strength is our distribution network. Our ability to keep deals on the road. Our upfitters, our bailment policies, and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup. And we have more ambitions, as you can see with the FCS software business. That business is growing very fast. It's a telematics and commercial services business. And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the 4 walls of the product. 
So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products. We're going to get more digital, and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well. But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation. As John said, we have a good owner base."

Is it just simply that you looked at the cost of developing software and you feel like it's to complicate too costly and then Google is a better solution to bring that connectivity to your customers? Or has the willingness to find commercial arrangements will Google improve in terms of revenue sharing, for example, that made working Google maybe less threatening, it might have been a few years ago? 
And then for John, I was just wondering, if -- you're the first OEM to give us some guidance on the impact of semiconductor shortage on earnings, and i thank you for that. I'm just trying to understand, you guide for the impact -- what the impact could be in the first half. Let's assume things normalize from the third quarter.

First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship. So we want Carplay to work great in all of the vehicles. We want Amazon voice products to work great in our vehicles. But the Google things really changed the answer to your question or evolved. The first one was we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better. 
And we could take our team instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation. And we found that in Mach-E. If you use the Mach-E, we call it the systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a broncho customer or make or a commercial customer. 
So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle. The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data. And how that would be protected. And that's really important. Ford is a very trusted brand. All the data will be held and managed by Ford, whole won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud. 
The third thing was they're cloud. We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability. And we think the U.S. is really competitive, but so is Amazon, those Microsoft. But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML. We are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that. 
And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment. So those are kind of the things that really swayed us I hope that makes sense. But it's not necessarily exclusive. And we really are excited about the subscription business and digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies. John?"

Last year was like no other with COVID dramatically and often tragically affecting all of us. But tough times can bring out the best in people and, boy, was that true at Ford. I'm really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis. We harnessed our capabilities, and we developed a lot of new ones. Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work but also to make life-saving equipment.
And I'd like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new Finish Strong initiative to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control. To date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks. And by midyear, we will have donated 100 million masks. In partnership with UAW, we've also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with 3M and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns.
More to the point of today's call, we relied on the same grit and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances. We improved our execution while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming Ford into a far stronger company, a company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences.
After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year's shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuilt our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand. In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched 3 incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction. Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and, more importantly, others believe is the first credible mass-marketed competitor to Tesla. And the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America's favorite vehicle, it's now connected. You can sleep in it. You can work in it. It's incredibly capable, and it is such a fantastic product. And the Bronco Sport, the first member of our reimagined legendary Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career. 
Now as we recap last year's results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan. Simply put, we're seeing real improvements in our core automotive business, and we are laser-focused on further progress this year. Now this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit. We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value, to achieve that we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must-have products and services and rewarding customer experiences. We're moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses.
We will start to grow again, but most importantly, in the right areas, allocating more capital, resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups, commercial vehicles and utilities; being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale; expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue and incubating, then scaling, then integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI's world-class self-driving system.
Today, I'll touch on a few of our planned highlights with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity. Back in 2017, vehicle lines that accounted for just 60% of our company's revenue generated 150% of our EBIT, and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital. This imbalance was simply not sustainable, and we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business. We allocated capital to our strengths. We jettisoned underperforming assets. We created a more focused portfolio and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford.
We've already made a tremendous progress. Through last year, we've invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint. In the first phase of redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the #1 vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that build our brand and make a solid return.
We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe. We've reduced regional headcount by 20%. We lowered our annual structure cost by $1.1 billion through last year. And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than 4 years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%.
Let's turn to South America. We've lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable. In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region. We discontinued focus on Fiesta. And we further reduced headcount, in fact, by more than 40% through the end of last year. And with these actions, last year, we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. And then in early January, we went further. As Ford Brazil announced, it would end production and close 3 facilities, that decision will derisk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports. We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting, connected and increasingly electrified SUVs, pickups, including this amazing new Ranger and commercial vehicles, sourced in Argentina and Uruguay and other markets.
Now we didn't take these actions lightly. And Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions. At the same time, we know they were right and necessary. And we're optimistic about our new business model for South America. 
Now before John walks through the last year's results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford's connectivity and electrification plans. 2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford. We have hundreds of thousands of fully network vehicles now in the field. And now we're seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data, streaming off those vehicles and also use our over-the-air updates to improve quality and revolutionize the Ford customer experience and, importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers. We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford Commercial Services, and we are just starting.
Ford's development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new 6-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week. The 2 companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call Team Upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system. The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team's ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide Ford with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed of our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company.
Now as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world. We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale. It's early in the transition, but the trend is clear. We watched 1 out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow, and the reality is that customers, including in the U.S., are increasingly giving e-mobility greater consideration. We have no intention to cede ground to others in vehicle segments where Ford is the established leader.
We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities. We're also increasing financial flexibility so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers.
Now the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year, embodies how we lead in electric vehicles. It's on sale now. It has stunning design. It is a fully connected and ready for the over-the-air updates with a tremendous technology experience.  It's delivering high-quality, exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s. It's a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric. And there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming in.
As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles, and we're on the leading edge of the electric revolution there, too. We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck. With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has 3 different lengths, 3 different heights. We have a van, a stripped chassis and a cutaway, and there's more coming on E-Transit. And then we're going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year.
In a recent study by Cox Automotive, they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups that are coming to the market. Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan. We understand the needs of these customers. We're going to offer a wide variety of configurations that I mentioned. And we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them -- connect to services. For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a Transit is 74 miles. And they do not overbuy batteries. We validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers. Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over-the-air alerts, so when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for 100% uptime, we can do that, that van stays on the road, working, where it belongs. Those are just 2 of dozens of examples of how we're employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford.
The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicle's interiors, digital experiences, ease service networks, to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost. These are very sticky, annuity-like capabilities that remove pain points and create opportunities for our customers. No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and introduce services like these at scale.
We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan. We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025, and that's just electrification. When you include the spending on autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion. The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners. This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production, whether alone or in a JV.
As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing. So far, we're busy, and we're included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150. We're building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit; Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs; and in China and Cuautitlan, Mexico for the Mach-E. And there's a lot more to come. Our team is busy. Thanks for your time and attention. And as you can hear, I'm very excited about our future. John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year. Over to you, John."

So when you analyze our fourth quarter results or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business increasingly positione",1725,"Thanks, Jim. So when you analyze our fourth quarter results or even our second half performance last year, it's important to key in on the durable changes we've made to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow.
Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest in growth and even accelerate investments, if we choose to, in key areas like electrification and connected services. And at our 8% company adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we're aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth.
And when we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy. EV penetration at scale was years out. Connectivity and digital services were still nascent. And autonomous vehicles will -- they were still largely in labs. So you fast forward to 2021 and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital. Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and, in doing so, to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value.
So let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance. In automotive, both wholesale and revenue declined by 9%. While a lower industry influenced both of these metrics, so did the plan changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150. Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe. 
Let's take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America. The North American business offset some of its decline in top line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles. Together, volume and revenue of Transit and Super Duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively. With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we're building every vehicle we can.
EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%. This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost in the fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned. In South America, wholesale and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and forward share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths in Ranger pickups, Transit van and key imports. On a full year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%. Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale, as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures. 
As Jim mentioned, in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the focus in Fiesta and further reduced headcount, in total, by more than 40% through the end of 2020. These actions and other actions that we've been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT. And we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally derisked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign.
Shifting to Europe. Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes. However, Ford's revenue in the region was up modestly, aided by higher net pricing and improved mix. Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its #1 position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points. Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated Transit centers. And during the quarter, the commercial, passenger and Imports vehicle businesses were all profitable. And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced, along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last 2 years, allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in 4 years with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%.
Now turning to China. China delivered a 27% increase in wholesale. Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%. Ford share in China grew by 40 basis points to 2.4%, with a 12-point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%. The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter, supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles. Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive.
Now while it's still a modest EBIT loss, this was China's third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement, aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally built Lincoln products. The China-specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brand's in-country retail sales. That's up from just 2% last year. 
Wholesales and revenue results for the International Market Group varied, but its retail sales increase of 1.8% countered an industry decline of 3%. IMG continues to capitalize on its strength in Ranger pickups and Everest SUVs, and  Ranger was the best-selling 4x4 pickup in Australia.
Now just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe. This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and  profitably grow this important business for us. Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter, led by Australia and Vietnam. 
In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture. This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic. While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India.
Turning to Mobility. We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020. Our plans include standing up a commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods. And we also believe that Argo AI self-driving system remains on a short list of leaders in the autonomous technology. With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative modes of transportation. In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits that applied for in the U.S. in municipalities last year.
Now let's turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter. Improved auction values drove the performance, and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss-to-receivables ratio. All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points. Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I'm incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year.
So let's turn to 2021. The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid, and we're evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real time. We want to be transparent and also prudent. Therefore, we think it's premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full year results. That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change and the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time.
For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million noncash gain on our investment in Rivian. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year. We anticipate ability to be flat and Ford Credit EBT to improve. We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow.
However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year. The situation is changing constantly. So it's premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full year results. However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first quarter production.
If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year. So we should expect full year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile, given the mechanics of the company's working capital.
So our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations. For example, similar to other actions we've already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant. These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first quarter volume that I just mentioned. We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first quarter 2021 financial results and that's on April 28. 
So before we open the call for Q&A, I will end where Jim began. It cannot be overstated that 2020 was a year like no other, no other in our lifetime. The Ford team responded exceptionally, both personally and professionally. We're exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world. We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows. And that financial flexibility will allow us to make right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation."

I know you have a lot of confidence in these vehicles, but are there any objective measures that you can share with investors as to why they should also be confident in the profit contribution of these models?
So I know it's early days. But do you have any anecdotes about how quickly the vehicles are turning on dealer lots, how the pricing has been trending for the new F-150, what the earlier customer reaction has been to the Mach-E, are you doing a lot of test drives?

Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics we see that give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time. That's one thing. So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year. We're starting the year with 53-day supply. The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model. So Lariat Plus mix is extremely strong. You also look at the Super Duty demand. Super Duty was up 14%. It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger. And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in 6 days, the F-150.
If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far. We have -- about 70% of the customers are new to Ford. So we have -- new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years. The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E-Class. We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders high all-wheel drive mix more than we thought. The extended battery is much more popular than we expected. And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that each were $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side. So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E.
On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like 6 days. We sold everyone wholesale through dealers in the fourth quarter. I think we sold over 5,000. It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan. And I would say, the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders.
The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest. Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought. It's encouraging to see the 2-door [indiscernible], but the 4-door is very, very strong mix. And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong. And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January. I think we passed 8,000 units. So I mean -- and that's the brand-new model to our lineup. So that gives you a picture for the demand side. And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of the performance?"

I'd just say, Ryan, that when you look at it, Jim went through the portfolio transformation, but the global redesign is really starting to take hold and derisking the business. We're starting to see some strength in China. The localization of key project -- of products there, Lincoln, for sure; improving our cost structure there by localizing. We're leveraging capacity at the JVs to build Lincolns and commercial vehicles. Our partnering to share investments and improve scale. You saw that with the South Africa announcement we had, building the Ranger and a VW pickup now in that facility.
So I think we're starting to see strength across all the areas we've been talking about. We're also focusing on the basics of the business, right? We've renewed our focus on our quality improvement. We're leveraging all of our connected vehicles to identify issues faster, improve our warranty expense, improve our ownership experience. We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year. 
And we're really transforming the team as well. We're bringing in new talent. We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services. And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting. So I think there's a lot of good things going on here."

I mean, when do you think sort of the tipping point is for the consumers, where they see enough EVs on the road that your ICE vehicles become somewhat obsolete and it depresses resids. And how do you kind of work through that transition?
And specifically also around the F-150, I mean, can you position this as a performance enhancement, particularly around torque for trucks that you can actually get paid a tremendous amount of money for kind of like you did with Ecoboost. I mean I think if you choke around Ecoboost, it wasn't really fuel economy that people loved with the low-end torque, right? I mean -- so I mean, just what's the tipping point where you kind of get hit a little bit on your resids, on your outgoing ICE vehicles? How do you manage that transition? And how do you think about how you position in EVs?"

I watched the market really carefully in Europe, and 10% in December pure battery electric is amazing. Our time is now at Ford. We're not talking about aspirations. We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that. This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-E. It's in the market now. We think it's a real competitor to Tesla in their stronghold part of their price market. The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers. We sold 780,000 F-150s last year. We are going to find, and we are finding within that a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers. It's such a large scale.
In Transit electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high. This is our turf. And we're not just going to have 1 delivery vehicle. We're going to have 3 lengths, 2-wheel bases, 3 roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van, and we're not done. So we are the leader in the Transit business. We have the body builder connections. 100% of our Transits get updated. And we know every one of those of updaters. So -- and we are getting more inbound for that.
So how do we manage the move? I think it's a really good question. I don't know if any of us have the answer. The costs are coming down quickly. But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors, it's about a digital vehicle and a new customer experience. And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about. We have 130,000 Commercial Solution customers now. We have 9 million Ford Pass customers. That is universal.
So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business. We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible. And we'll invest in both. And we'll flex with the customers. So I think we're ready. This is our year. We're going to have great offers. And I think it's really on us. The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year. It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or 2 after we launch it with the same customer."

And yes, we do see them being profitable. In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the Mach-E. 
So it's going to transition over time. We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles. We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus we have from a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EVs. And as Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV. We're focused on expanding that growth. We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles. And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? These are segments that we lead in. There's a strong customer base. And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles, there's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles, and we're going to continue to work with them to give them the solutions they need from a battery electric standpoint.

But that's a very fundamental bet, and it looks like the market is liking what he's doing, too, which is good for Ford.
The partnership with Google is very fundamental. It goes far beyond. We want our team working on things that will differentiate us. Google has got a great platform for navigation and content delivery, and we can co-create on top of that. And their -- the system is great, but we're going to use Amazon Voice, and we're going to work hard with Apple on Power PLAY. And we're going to have a great relationship with Microsoft on commercial vehicles, which will tell you about some other day. But our partnerships in the technology area, including the Chinese technology firms, is just going to get deeper and deeper and deeper.
And as far as our relationships, our partnerships, they will change with electrification. And you should expect more work in that regard. Anyways, I don't think you're going to have to wait too long to hear more about that actually. So it's a fundamental approach. The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver that digital experience, but also to build the capability inside the company for large-scale AI/ML deployment to our industrial system, the customer experience, using the data off the vehicles for quality improvement.

The answer is absolutely, this accelerated spending is on products and industrializing those products. And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions. We just don't have anything announced today. We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have 2 battery electric dedicated platforms. They will include high-volume passenger cars. But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest. And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are. And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles and as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work.
We've learned over all these years that Ford's strength in commercial is far beyond the product. In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is. Our strength is our distribution network. Our ability to keep vehicles on the road, our upfitters, our bailment policies and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup. And we have more ambitions as you can see with the FCS software business. That business is growing very fast. It's a telematics and commercial services business. And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the 4 walls of the product.
So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products, we're going to get more digital, and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well. But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation. As John said, we have a good owner base."

Jim, on this alliance with -- relationship with Google is interesting, and we had Renault do a similar arrangement 2 weeks ago in Europe. If I step back a few years ago, I remember Google being seen as the enemy and the company that car makers had to stay away from and avoid seeing Google getting to the car. What has changed? Is it just simply that you looked at the cost of developing software and you feel like it's too complicated, too costly and then Google is a better solution to bring the connectivity to your customers? Or has the willingness to find commercial arrangements with Google improved in terms of revenue sharing, for example, that made working with Google maybe less threatening than it might have been a few years ago?
And then for John, I was just wondering, if -- you're the first OEM to give us some guidance on the impact of semiconductor shortage on earnings and I thank you for that. I'm just trying to understand, you guide for the impact -- what the impact could be in the first half. Let's assume things normalize from the third quarter, how much of that negative impact in the first half would you be able to make up in the second half?

First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship. So we want CarPlay to work great in all of the vehicles. We want Amazon voice products to work great in our vehicles. But the Google, 3 things really changed, to answer to your question, or evolved. The first one was we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better. And we could take our team and instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation. And we found that in Mach-E. If you use the Mach-E, we call, the Menlo Systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a Bronco customer or Mach-E or a commercial customer.
So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle. The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data and how that would be protected. And that's really important. Ford is a very trusted brand. All the data will be held and managed by Ford. Google won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud.
The third thing was they're cloud. We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability. And we think their cloud is really competitive, so is Amazon, so is Microsoft. But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML. We are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that. And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment.
So those are kind of the things that really swayed us. I hope that makes sense. But it's not necessarily exclusive, and we really are excited about the subscription business and digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies. John?"

And what we see is that we could lose between 10% and 20% of the planned first half production. And so when you take that on an annual basis, the impact of that full year could be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion.
And like we do and we did -- like we do and like we did with COVID, we've assumed in there some reasonable cost recoveries and our ability to recover some of the production in the second half. And so the net impact on the year would be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, depending on where this falls out relative to the production disruption in the first half. And that's why we tried to frame it up to give a scenario around what it could be because it's very fluid right now. And as we get through this quarter, in April, we'll be able to share more details. We think we'll have a lot more understanding of exactly how this is going to fall out."

Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pity sound bite. But if I had to sum it up one way, it would be this. We're executing on our plan and I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities, all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders. 
In the quarter, we earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT. It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever. And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage. We mobilized a global team, as we always do in these times of crisis, and we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing. Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints through sharp yield management and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations. That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships and improving our go-to-market execution. And Ford credit, which, in our view, is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter. 
Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industry-wide imbalance of supply and demand, given the semiconductor shortage. However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign and our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen. The benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S. to just 3 years. And of course, we made progress on cost across the business. 
As we share with you today, there are more white water moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have work to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say, fully charged. 
Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team. As our underlying strength of Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital, gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth. We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a far more vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products but also, and I would argue more importantly, an always on, ever-improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers. 
So let me share a few milestones from the quarter. Turning around auto. Over the past 4 years, our overseas markets lost a total of $5.8 billion in EBIT. This quarter, the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT. That's a $1 billion improvement year-over-year. Let's look at those must-have services and products. Well, it starts with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue and it had new innovations like Pro Power Onboard, which showed again that we understand Ford customers -- at Ford, these truck customers better than anyone. And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start, bringing 60% new customers to our brand. The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe and coming to China. And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand, almost 70%. And we still have the Big Bronco, the [ 2 in the 4 door ] with an incredible order bank, the F-150 electric and the e-Transit. And we have some surprises for you as well. Stay tuned. 
Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we are only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles. We have successfully deployed our first major over the update -- software updates to hundreds of thousands of customers for Mach-E and F-150. And this pace will only accelerate in the next several years, making our vehicles better over time. Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first tested -- fully-tested Ford Blue Cruise, hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over-the-air to Mustang E and F-150 customers. And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over-the-air updated capable vehicles on the road. Now this installed base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products and for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers. They'll make significant improvements to our customers' experience and drive quality of our vehicles. 
And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford's strength. For example, we announced we're investing $1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany, where by 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high-volume all-electric passenger car for Europe. A year later in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero emissions capable. And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all-electric. Now these investments are part -- just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong. 
And yesterday, we announced a very important new development. We have formed a new global Battery Center of Excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery as well as battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing. This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions. There is so much more to come. 
Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors. When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter. And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second half. It's kind of played out similar to that with one big exception: the industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier who manufactures about 2/3 of all chips in the auto industry, experienced a significant fire at the Naka 3 facility. Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs source their chips from this facility, including 9 Tier 1s that supply us at Ford. Now Renesas expects it will return to full capacity in July, and they're making great progress. While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints and we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry. Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022, making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging. As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24/7, and engaging with key political leaders and decision-makers globally as well as, of course, our supply chain. 
Ford relationship with the new Biden Administration rests on our distinctive profile. That we assemble more vehicles and have more U.S. order jobs than any other competitor. It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make. So from COVID PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, the batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country. Now we found the White house and the new cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive. We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulate policies to facilitate the transformation from ICE to BEV and finally address infrastructure deficits. 
As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company. We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road. This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors, but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation. We're also learning as we operate in this extraordinary low stock, high demand environment in the U.S. and around the world, that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future. We're getting more fit. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John."
106335,710742824,2261507,"Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Credit Company LLC, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. And that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage. So o",1774,"Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. And that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage. So our confidence in the stronger run rate, it's built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow that of course, provides us the financial flexibility to invest in growth, and these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook. 
So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher-margin vehicles. And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the U.S. was $1,900 more per unit than the industry average. Now also, the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses that started to turn the tide, rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results. 
Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty. Over the last 3 years, our warranty expense has increased by more than $2 billion. Now we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality, and now how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements. Now this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year-over-year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress. So these are just a few, 3 of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original target for 2021. 
So now let me turn to this quarter. Wholesale declined 6%, and in most cases, that's due to the chip constraints. Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6%, aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix. We delivered $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%. And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of $900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well. And then adjusted free cash flow was negative $400 million. 
The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units, and that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February. In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the lost volume. So we reduced incentives as part of the industry-wide response to tighten dealer inventories, and that's especially in North America. We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher-margin, higher-demand vehicles. We also reduced our structural cost in areas, including manufacturing and advertising. We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures, and we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for our used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell. So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound. 
Now our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative $400 million was significantly lower than our $4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT. Now there's 3 main factors that contributed to this gap. First, our gain on Rivian was noncash; second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion. Now this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips. But it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles, those are primarily in North America that are awaiting installation of chip related components. And so some of this inventory impact, though, was offset by a growth in payables. And third is timing differences. Now this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty. This reserve -- that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter. The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles waiting sale and dealer inventory and the expected incentive per unit, and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption. Now we do expect the working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, if dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels. And we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022. 
Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress, such as this chip shortage, while also investing in growth. So we ended the quarter with over $31 billion of cash and $47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent $2.3 billion convertible issuance. We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure. 
Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly-launched products, making sure that we process customer orders in high-margin vehicles quickly, and that was all in a supply-constrained environment. And the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital to BEVs, including investments to in-source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability. 
So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter. In North America, wholesale declined 14%, while revenue increased 5%. Now revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight industry-wide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis, and that included warranty. All of that helped us deliver $2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8%, which was North America's highest margin in 5 years. 
In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40%, respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products. The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
In Europe, wholesale declined 4% as revenue grew 13%, aided by improved product mix, led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing. These actions, together with our continued focus on cost, delivered $341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%. 
In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue. EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near premium utilities and commercial vehicles. In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally; was profitable, posting its best-ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis. And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprised 48% of Ford's total China sales. 
And IMG grew for wholesale, revenue has -- grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest. And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing and favorable exchange. All markets in IMG were profitable except for India. And IMG also committed to invest $1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets. 
In mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy. It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and along with Argo AI, is simulating ride-hail and delivery across 6 cities. And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered $1 billion in EBT in the quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. As we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year due to the growing chip constraints. We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. That would take us off our original target of $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. So we've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire. While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes. So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year. 
Now while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022. So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second half production. In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about $2.5 billion EBIT. That headwind and that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year. Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February and brings our full year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion. 
And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled, we have worked to continue the EBIT impact to the high end of our original range. So we now also expect full year adjusted free cash flow of $500 million to $1.5 billion, and this includes a $3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors. The semiconductor impact on cash is $500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences in working capital impacts that will recover once our run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound. 
Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative and that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions, driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions. However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation. And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID-related production disruptions last year. 
So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day."

Look, I wanted to just maybe get a little bit more clarification on the guidance. I think everybody understands that the underlying guidance ex the semiconductor shortage impact isn't really changing. And I don't think anyone would react to that at all, if it wasn't for how surprisingly strong Q1 was. You almost did $5 billion of EBIT including the gain and $4 billion excluding it. So the numbers, obviously, are going to be pretty low for the rest of the year. 
I guess my questions on this are, was there, first of all, an usual gain on incentives for inventory at dealers in Q1? Could Q2 actually be as low as Q2 of last year? 
And then even more importantly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether we can extrapolate anything from these kinds of numbers. You did a double-digit margin in North America, 5% Europe. Looks like some pretty good warranty improvement. So when the dust settles, what do you think we can pull out of this as we think out about 2022?"

That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate of the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you",564,"Yes. Rod, thanks. That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate of the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things. As I said in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying business is improving, and you're seeing that come through. You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations. You saw that in warranty expense improving, right? Those are 2 things that we said we needed to improve in our business as we move forward through the redesign. And you're seeing that come through. 
You're also seeing the strength of our new products. Now it's a little opaque, I think, for people to say, well, you also saw a considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances. That is true. But so if we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products since we started the redesign, the refresh. And that's where we come back to. Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase, compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1,900 more than the industry. So that strength is flowing through. Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply and demand imbalance. And so that hit the quarter as well. We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter as we had lower production, so we optimize the production to a higher-margin and a higher mixed vehicle. So we saw that flow through as well. So you're seeing that combination happen and impact us in Q1. 
Now remember, for the year, as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities. We saw very little commodity impact in Q1. That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place, and we had our hedging. And so as we go through the year, we expect as contracts roll off, and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum steel and precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities, Q2 through Q4. So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year. We also will have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain. 
And we also expect that as we go through the quarter and we get to more normalized levels of production, albeit, we said 10% lower in the second half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter, the benefit of that. And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values, and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through. And I have to say that what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the $2.5 billion despite the volume impact growing significantly."

Is that sort of the run rate of profitability for the business? And there's obviously adjustments in warranty and South America restructuring, new product and things. Maybe you could just speak to that and how we should be thinking about the run rate of profitability?"

We would see better quality because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on plots as long. We'd have improved dealer profitability because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan. And we'd have lower incentives.

But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete. The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always-on relationship with the customer. That is the real change at Ford. The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary. It's the important foundation.

But we do know the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought. 
As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume. We think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning. But we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen. It's just too early to tell. The Renesas impact is, we think, is going to be largely finished by the second quarter. If they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now. And so that kind of leaves us back with the Taiwanese foundries and how persistent that's going to be.

They still negotiated a direct deal. These are all on the table at Ford right now, as you can imagine. We're also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries and silicon, and all sorts of other components that are really mission-critical for our company and our capability.

You did take $3 billion of price in 1Q, although I'm cognizant there's a lot that goes into that calculation, including relative to new launches, et cetera. I think pricing is historically positive on launch models. I think, as you mentioned, you have a lot of those this year, but it tends to be negative for carryover models. And I'm just thinking back to like 2011, 2012, kind of coming out of the financial crisis in '08-'09 after a lot of final assembly capacity have been taken out. I recall you and others reporting on the relative anomaly of positive pricing on even carryover model. So I'm just curious if we could see something similar now, say, if the commodities headwind were to grow worse, if the supply demand dynamic puts the industry in a position to pass really all the incremental cost on to the consumer? Or how do you see maybe the share of the burden taking place? Maybe the higher commodities being -- the cost of it being shared between yourselves versus the consumer versus suppliers, dealer margin, I don't know what you think."

It's just too hard to tell from my standpoint. 
I will note, though, based on your question, many of the vehicles that are supposedly aging at Ford or normally would be aging, are still relatively new. Super Duty is relatively new, Explorer's relatively new. Yes, Escape, we have all the Lincoln lineup as brand new. So normally, we wouldn't have so much new at the same time.

We did not expect that we would be able to more than offset all of the impact of the chips in the quarter, which -- where it was 17% or about 200,000 units.

We also then -- because of the supply in balance, we really pushed hard on mix. So those were things that allowed us to improve the quarter. We did not expect used vehicle prices to increase 14% in the quarter, and they did, and that helped, and that was part of what's happened with Ford credit and the performance of Ford Credit. 
And then as we go through the year, Emmanuel, one of the things that did not hit us in the first quarter that's going to hit us through the rest of the year is the commodity cost increases that come in quite significantly through Q2 to Q4. So those are some of the things that are coming back and are going to come through the second half of the year.

All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe, and you've seen that 2 quarters in a row now. 
Then when you look at South America, we reduced our volumes significantly, and we improved our profitability, and that just comes back to the point that we structure the market, and we are.

Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pity soundbite. But if I had to sum it up one way, it would be this: we're executing on our plan, and I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities, all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders.
In the quarter, we earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT. It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever. And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage. We mobilized a global team, as we always do in these times of crisis, and we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing. Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints through sharp yield management and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations. That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships and improving our go-to-market execution. And Ford Credit, which, in our view, is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter.
Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industry-wide imbalance of supply and demand given the semiconductor shortage. However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign in our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen; the benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S. to just 3 years; and of course, we made progress on cost across the business. As we share with you today, there are more white-water moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have work to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged.
Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team as our underlying strength of Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth. We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a far more vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products but also, and I would argue more importantly, an always on, ever-improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers. So let me share a few milestones from the quarter.
Turning around auto. Over the past 4 years, our overseas markets lost a total of $5.8 billion in EBIT. This quarter, the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT. That's a $1 billion improvement year-over-year. Let's look at those must-have services and products. Well, it starts with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue, and it had new innovations like Pro Power Onboard, which showed again that we understand at Ford these truck customers better than anyone. And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start, bringing 60% new customers to our brand. The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe and coming to China. And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand, almost 70%. And we still have the Big Bronco, the 2- and the 4-door with an incredible order bank, the F-150 Electric and the E-Transit. And we have some surprises for you as well. Stay tuned.
Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we are only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles. We have successfully deployed our first major over-the-air update -- software updates to hundreds of thousands of customers for Mach-E and F-150. And this pace will only accelerate in the next several years, making our vehicles better over time. Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first tested -- fully-tested Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over-the-air to Mustang E and F-150 customers. And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over-the-air updated, capable vehicles on the road. Now this installed base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products and, for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers. They'll make significant improvements to our customers' experience and drive quality of our vehicles.
And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford's strength. For example, we announced we're investing $1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany where, by 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high-volume, all-electric passenger car for Europe. A year later, in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero emissions capable. And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all-electric. Now these investments are part -- just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong. And yesterday, we announced a very important new development. We have formed a new global Battery Center of Excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery as well as battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing. This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions. There is so much more to come.
Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors. When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter. And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second half. It's kind of played out similar to that with one big exception: the industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier who manufactures about 2/3 of all chips in the auto industry, experienced a significant fire at their Naka 3 facility. Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs source their chips from this facility, including 9 Tier 1s that supply us at Ford. Now Renesas expects it will return to full capacity in July, and they're making great progress.
While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual-sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints, and we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry. Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022, making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging. As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24/7 and engaging with key political leaders and decision-makers globally as well as, of course, our supply chain.
Ford relationship with the new Biden Administration rests on our distinctive profile: that we assemble more vehicles and have more U.S. order jobs than any other competitor. It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make. So from COVID PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, the batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country. Now we found the White House and the new Cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive. We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulate policies to facilitate the transformation from ICE to BEV and finally address infrastructure deficits.
As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company. We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road. This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation. We're also learning, as we operate in this extraordinary low-stock, high-demand environment in the U.S. and around the world, that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future. We're getting more fit.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John."

So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. And that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of the global semiconductor shortage.",1764,"Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. And that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of the global semiconductor shortage. So our confidence in the stronger run rate is built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow and, of course, provides us financial flexibility to invest in growth. And these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook.
So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher-margin vehicles. And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the U.S. was $1,900 more per unit than the industry average. Now also, the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses had started to turn the tide. Rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results.
Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty. Over the last 3 years, our warranty expense has increased by more than $2 billion. Now we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality and now, how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements. Now this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year-over-year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress. So these are just a few, 3, of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original targets for 2021.
So now let me turn to this quarter. Wholesale declined 6% and, in most cases, that's due to the chip constraints. Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6% aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix. We delivered $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%. And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of $900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well. And then adjusted free cash flow was negative $400 million.
The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units, and that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February. In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the lost volume. So we reduced incentives as part of the industry-wide response to tighten dealer inventories, and that's especially in North America. We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher-margin, higher-demand vehicles. We also reduced our structural cost in areas including manufacturing and advertising. We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures, and we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for our used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell. So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound.
Now our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative $400 million was significantly lower than our $4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT. Now there's 3 main factors that contributed to this gap. First, our gain on Rivian was noncash. Second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion. Now this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips, but it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles, and those are primarily in North America, that are awaiting installation of chip-related components. And so some of this inventory impact, though, was offset by a growth in payables. And third is timing differences. Now this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty. This reserve -- that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter. The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles awaiting sale and dealer inventory and the expected incentive per unit, and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption.
Now we do expect the working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, as dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels. And we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022.
Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress, such as this chip shortage, while also investing in growth. So we ended the quarter with over $31 billion of cash and $47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent $2.3 billion convertible issuance. We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure.
Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly-launched products, making sure that we process customer orders in high-margin vehicles quickly, and that was all in a supply-constrained environment. And the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital to BEVs, including investments to in-source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability.
So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter. In North America, wholesales declined 14%, while revenue increased 5%. Now revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight, industry-wide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis, and that included warranty. All of that helped us deliver $2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8%, which was North America's highest margin in 5 years.
In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40%, respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products. The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.
In Europe, wholesales declined 4% as revenue grew 13% aided by improved product mix led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing. These actions, together with our continued focus on cost, delivered $341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%.
In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue. EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near-premium utilities and commercial vehicles. In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally, was profitable, posting its best-ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis. And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprised 48% of Ford's total China sales.
And IMG grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest. And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing and favorable exchange. All markets in IMG were profitable except for India. And IMG also committed to invest $1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets.
In Mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy. It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and, along with Argo AI, is simulating ride-hail and delivery across 6 cities. And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered $1 billion in EBT in the quarter.
Now turning to guidance. As we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year due to the growing chip constraints. We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. That would take us off our original target of $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT. So we've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire. While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes. So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year.
Now while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022. So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second half production. In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about $2.5 billion EBIT. And that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year. Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February and brings our full year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion.
And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled, we have worked to contain EBIT impact to the high end of our original range. So we now also expect full year adjusted free cash flow of $500 million to $1.5 billion, and this includes a $3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors. The semiconductor impact on cash is $500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences and working capital impacts that will recover once our run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound.
Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative, and that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions. However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation. And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID-related production disruptions last year.
So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day."

Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate how proud I am of this Ford team for its commitment to deliver on our plan to fix automotive, to modernize the company and to find ways to disrupt our business and the traditional auto industry to create value that will be rewarded -- that will reward our stakeholders.
On May 26, we will hold a virtual presentation for an investment community where we plan to deep dive into our plan, as Lynn said. We're going to cover how we're going to lead the electric vehicle revolution in areas that we're strong at Ford. Number two, we're going to build out our industry-leading commercial vehicle business with products but as well services that lead to growth and new revenue streams, and we're going to leverage our connected vehicles to transform the customer experience and truly shift Ford from a more traditional OEM to a company where the manufacture and sale of the vehicle is just the very first step in an ever-improving, always-on and far more rewarding customer experience.
I so look forward to speaking to all of you soon as we continue our effort to create a Ford that can compete and especially win in this exciting new era of our industry. So with that, let's start the Q&A."

Look, I wanted to just maybe get a little bit more clarification on the guidance. I think everybody understands that the underlying guidance ex the semiconductor shortage impact isn't really changing. And I don't think anyone would react to that at all, if it wasn't for how surprisingly strong Q1 was. You almost did $5 billion of EBIT, including the gain, and $4 billion excluding it. So the numbers, obviously, are going to be pretty low for the rest of the year.
I guess my questions on this are, was there, first of all, an unusual gain on incentives for inventory at dealers in Q1? Could Q2 actually be as low as Q2 of last year? And then even more importantly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether we can extrapolate anything from these kinds of numbers. You did a double-digit margin in North America, 5% in Europe, looks like some pretty good warranty improvement. So when the dust settles, what do you think we can pull out of this as we think about 2022?"

That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate of the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you",563,"Yes. Rod, thanks. That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate of the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things. As I said in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying business is improving, and you're seeing that come through. You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations. You saw that in warranty expense improving, right? Those are 2 things that we said we needed to improve in our business as we move forward through the redesign, and you're seeing that come through. You're also seeing the strength of our new products.
Now it's a little opaque, I think, for people to say, well, you also saw a considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances. That is true. But so if we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products since we started the redesign, the refresh, and that's where we come back to. Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1,900 more than the industry. So that strength is flowing through. Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply and demand imbalance. And so that hit the quarter as well. We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter as we had lower production. So we optimized the production to our higher-margin and higher-mix vehicles. So we saw that flow through as well. So you're seeing that combination happen and impact us in Q1.
Now remember, for the year, as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities. We saw very little commodity impact in Q1. That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place, and we had our hedging. And so as we go through the year, we expect -- as contracts roll off and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum steel and precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities Q2 through Q4. So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year. We also will have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain. And we also expect that as we go through the quarter and we get to more normalized levels of production, albeit we said 10% lower in the second half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter, the benefit of that.
And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values, and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through. And I have to say that what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the $2.5 billion, despite the volume impact growing significantly."

It would allow us to have lower capital required at Ford Credit, if we have to finance less dealer inventory for our dealers. That could free up some capital to invest in other growth areas.
We would see better quality because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on plots as long. We'd have improved dealer profitability because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan. And we'd have lower incentives. We believe we'd have lower incentives because we'd have quicker turning vehicles, and we'd have higher orders.

And we'll see some stability in these international regions that hopefully will be profitable, but we won't always kind of be running around freaking out about whack-a-mole and one of the regions blowing up on us, it just seems like you're getting a handle in South America.

But let's be really clear, we're doubling down our iconic nameplates and building out a family of products. We just localized Explore in China. It's doing great. Lincoln is profitable in China. I mean the growth rate of Lincoln in China and the profitability improvement as we localize to 90%, as John said, has been very encouraging to us. So in China and North America, we'll focus on these really passion segments where we think we naturally do well.
But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete. The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always-on relationship with the customer. That is the real change at Ford. The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary. It's the important foundation. But what's sufficiency for us is to evolve into a different model with the customer, and you'll hear more about that in Capital Markets Day."

Thank you, Colin. I would say it's difficult to make that judgment.

But we do know the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought. As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume. We think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning, but we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen.
It's just too early to tell. The Renesas impact, we think, is going to be largely finished by the second quarter if they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now. And so that kind of leaves us back with the Taiwanese foundries and how persistent that's going to be. And right now, I just think it's a little too early to declare what that's going to look like.

And I would say, we -- as we got into this through the quarter, we have seen the team identify opportunities to offset more of the impact than we had originally thought. That's why we're able to contain a much higher miss on the volumes within that original guidance. And so the teams have been working extremely hard to bring the goodness that we're seeing in the core run rate of the business through and then to find other opportunities. So absolutely on both of those."

Do you need to change how you think about assuring supply and -- of key components, including chips and/or that sort of keeping more inventory historically, maybe it's more direct buy and not relying on Tier 1s? And if so, maybe again at a high level, how should we think about that practically working? Like, where in the value chain will that inventory be stored? And is that maybe a cost you're willing to incur for greater stability in the future?"

We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components that will be the essence of our new business, a modernized Ford, and it goes far beyond semi chips. There are other components that are really key enablers. It was very interesting for me personally as the CEO to talk to many of our colleagues in other industries and to find out how common buffer stocks are and how common direct buys are for the -- with the foundries, even if the company still buys the components with the chips on them from a supplier. They still negotiated a direct deal. These are all on the table at Ford right now, as you can imagine. We're also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries and silicon and all sorts of other components that are really mission-critical for our company and our capability.
When I look at the company and what we need to vertically integrate, these are the areas we're going to bet on moving inside the company for core competency. And as we do that, the supply chain becomes even more critical. But we also know more about it. So thank you for the question. And you can imagine everything is on the table, like you mentioned, from buffer stocks to direct deals with the foundries."

So I thought maybe it would be great to just sort of zero in on your performance in the first quarter itself and get your thoughts on what a 12.3% North America margin in 1Q might imply for margin potential in a normalized environment, kind of looking at the historical cadence of North America margin over the past 5 years or -- the 5 years ended in 2019, and it seems like 1Q margin averages just about 40 bps higher than the full year amount. And so maybe you're already operating in 1Q at almost a 12% kind of annual run rate, and that's amidst an F-150 launch and before any contribution from the Bronco. So how would you rate the underlying performance in North America? And does that performance in 1Q suggests, once all the supply chain dust settles, a stronger than targeted 10% regional margin?"

You've called out the $2.5 billion headwind for the year. You did take $3 billion of price in 1Q. Although I'm cognizant there's a lot that goes into that calculation, including relative to new launches, et cetera. I think pricing is historically positive on launch models, I think, particularly, as you mentioned, you have a lot of those this year, but it tends to be negative for carryover models. And I'm just thinking back to, like, 2011, 2012, kind of coming out of the financial crisis in '08-'09 after a lot of final assembly capacity have been taken out, I recall you and others reporting on the relative anomaly of positive pricing on even carryover models.
So I'm just curious if we could see something similar now. Say, if the commodities headwind were to grow worse, if the supply-demand dynamic puts the industry in a position to pass really all the incremental cost onto the consumer. Or how do you see maybe the share of the burden taking place? Maybe the higher commodities being -- the cost of it being shared between yourselves versus the consumer, versus suppliers, dealer margin, I don't know what you think."

And inflation, it feels like we're seeing inflation in variety parts of our industry kind of in ways we haven't seen for many years. On the other hand, it feels like it's all due to a lot of one-timers as the economy comes out of lockdown. So I think it's a bit too early to declare the run rate of where it's going to be. It's just too hard to tell from my standpoint. I will note, though, based on your question, that many of the vehicles that are supposedly aging at Ford, or normally would be aging, are still relatively new. Super Duty is relatively new, Explorer's relatively new. Yes, Escape, we have all the Lincoln lineup as brand new. So normally, we wouldn't have so much new at the same time.

All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe, and you've seen that 2 quarters in a row now.
Then when you look at South America, we reduced our volumes significantly and we improved our profitability. And that just comes back to the point that we [ need to restructure ] the market, and we are.

Early in the second quarter 2 months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future of Ford. Put simply, our Ford+ plan is focused on 2 things: really distinctive products that only Ford could do; and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that gets better and better over time. 
We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence and the industry's best captive finance company. But we're now adding new capabilities and new talents and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors. 
We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software and a lot more. Ford+ also means introducing the industry's most compelling high-volume electric vehicle lineup and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components. And with Argo AI, we're well positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential. 
But fundamental to transforming Ford is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market. Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter after quarter, year after year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment, like we did in the second quarter. Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our team skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT. And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter. It required intense focus from our team on cost, pricing and mix. 
The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio, and it's about to get a lot stronger. We stopped making me-too products in declining segments a few years ago, and we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford. The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the United States, was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y performance, the Porsche Taycan and the Audi e-tron. 
The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections. The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past 120,000 units, and 75% of those customers are new to Ford. We are now working around the clock to break constraints and increasing our manufacturing capacity for these red-hot new battery electric vehicles. 
We're working with LG Chem, SK Innovation to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%, and we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of the E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year. 
The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable. In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco 2- and 4-door models, and 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford. And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup that offers room for 5, gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000. And customers already recognize the value of this product, and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders. 
Great products alone are not sufficient, though, to deliver Ford+. Always on means we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities like connected services to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams. We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we call Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the air. Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems, we do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle. 
For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to connected services like FordPass are now over 95%. We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over the year just this year, and we expect this to top 600,000 vehicles by year-end. And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world. 
And we're mining the real-world data from these vehicles real time to better meet our customer needs. To me, this is the most important point. For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities. We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from $45 billion in 2025 from $27 billion in 2019. Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption by offering those customers the best scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers. It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now. 
In mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large-scale commercialization of Ford's AVs. Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry-first collaboration between Argo and Lyft to deploy Ford driverless vehicles on the Lyft TNC network. This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo's ability to connect into multiple TNCs or transportation networks. 
And on the technology front, Argo, I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo LiDAR, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on. This new LIDAR, designed to be cost effective and manufacturing at scale, will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance-sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection or safe highway driving. 
Now before John reports on the quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation. In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT. In fact, we did better than expected. We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits. We are seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid, especially due to the delay in ramp-up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half. 
Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand and improving chip supply. Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford. We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy. What does that mean? We're placing a greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks. We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible but it's better for customers, dealers and Ford. 
But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online, so we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank. This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives and reduce our order complexity and the industrial systems cost. For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want. Now this isn't theoretical. I hope we get into the Q&A. We're doing it right now as we speak. 
Relative to the supply chain, we made 3 notable changes. First, we are no longer relying on -- heavily on a tiered procurement structure for transparency. We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in the supply chain for our critical components, electronic components. With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information such as technology road maps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand. 
Second, we are providing longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements. And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain. Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing and design interchangeability in the case of single sources. These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford. Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation called Blue Oval SK will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical, given our demand for our new electric vehicles. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook."

Year-over-year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlapped the industry-wide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year. Now for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparisons and we think those are more appropriate. 
While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized for revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management. We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches and our more profitable vehicles. In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence and our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesale and share. 
So let's turn to our results. On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year-over-year, respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of $1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%. Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors, and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint as well as lower costs. 
And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of $1.6 billion, and that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford+.  And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services and EV charging. And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us. 
Now turning to the regions. North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesales due to the semiconductor shortage. Now as we manage the chip constraints, we've focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery. We exited the second quarter with our U.S. customer sold order bank up more than 7x compared to a year ago. And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand. On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up $1.1 billion. 
Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track. In aggregate, EBIT improved $800 million year-over-year but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%.  The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports. Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including [ 1 billion ] for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring and a new all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania. 
In South America, our restructuring is on track. Our lean, derisked and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with Ranger, Transit and key imported vehicles. The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach 1 in selected markets and is preparing now for the launch of the new Transit van in the second half of this year. 
In China, we continued to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles and with our portfolio of near-premium Ford vehicles. Lincoln attained its highest-ever quarterly sales was profitable and also captured the #1 spot in J.D. Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking, unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years. In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of our overall sales mix in China. And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year. 
Our international markets group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV. And we're continuing to assess our business in India and we'll have more to say on this later this year. 
Company-wide, second quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative $5.1 billion. As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances for marketing incentives. Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of $4 billion in the quarter. Now we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored. 
Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at $25.1 billion and $41 billion, respectively. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford+ plan. 
So now let's turn to the outlook. Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion. Now this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors. 
Our guidance implies we are -- we expect second half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year. And so we provided a bridge to help with this, and we've included that on Page 19 of our earnings presentation. So let me provide a little bit of color around this. Relative to tailwinds, we expect about $3 billion to $4 billion in favorable market factors, net of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes. 
Headwinds, right? We see headwinds coming through, and we see pressure on contribution margin. We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion half-over-half. Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half, up about $500 million, though we still expect full year warranty expense to be down year-over-year. Relative to structural costs, about $1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches. 
Looking at Ford Credit. Based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about $1 billion as auction values begin to normalize, and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half. And lastly, we also have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million noncash gain on Rivian we booked in the first quarter. And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022. 
We are also increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow target to $4 billion to $5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement in chip availability. Now as our operating results improve, so does our cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%. And the strength in cash conversion and our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs, Ford Pro, our connected services and mobility. 
Now looking towards 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leverage one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford+ plan. We're on a new path at Ford. We've got a plan, the resources and the resolve to build a better business. So now I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions."

So we do see strength in the product line up heading into next year. 
But what we also see heading into next year, a few headwinds. Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see. And that's because we see auction values coming down, and then we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well. 
We also see that next year, as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation. Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well. And we're going to continue to invest in our new product portfolios. We've got the launches coming in next year. We've got our Ford+ plan so we see that continuing as we head into next year as well. So there are some headwinds but the underlying strength of the business continues to be positive. And with that, we see that trajectory continuing into '22 and then on our way to the 8% EBIT margin for '23."

And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford but they aren't new to this segment. These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles. What is really interesting for me is someone portray the full-size truck industry is kind of a conservative customer, that's not what we're seeing.

And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up now, up and running now, launch now. As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there.

Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order-based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days supply. I've been here at Ford for 13 years. There were many years after the financial crisis where our days supply was 20, 30, 40 days. And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S. was 1,000 to 2,000 a month. We are now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units. That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we're looking at this order bank change for the company. 
A lot of people in our industry are making a big deal about the move online, sure. But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system. You put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly. It reduces our dealers' costs more than just low days supply as you mentioned. It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives. And I guarantee you -- I don't know how much money we're wasting. I know we're wasting money on incentives. I just don't know where. With an order-based system, we will have much less risk of that. 
It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well. So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach. I'd love to talk to you more about it but I've tried to give you the high hard ones."

So I'm just curious how you decide where that balance lands, how you keep the inventory tight, your partners' dealership happy and selling and creating value for you. 
But then also a big part of the story is the tightness in the secondary market, in the used market, keeping high, which is helping the new vehicle price and it's certainly helping out at Ford Motor Credit.

Our target is 50 to 60 days supply. That means trucks will be a little bit higher. We have a lot -- about 1/3 of our truck dealers in County. Five trucks to them could be 100 days supply but they need 5 trucks for the local community. And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range. 
Different segments will have different targets. We actually did this post financial crisis for a few years and then over time, lost discipline. And this is quite important for this management team. We have a weekly and a monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions. That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment. 
Going to an order bank, I would say, is a hardwired way of reducing the stock. And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition. It can't be just relying on management keeping within that range. We certainly will have exception -- an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams. But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order to delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift because for Bronco and Mach-E and some of the other high-demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system. 
We then realized, ""My God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles?"" And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes, like order complexity reduction in the system to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford. I think it's going to require both changes."

Just really interesting, when you combine the order bank system with always-on, where you go kind of can engage the consumer directly for services and F&I and insurance in the OTA. 
But I am talking to some dealers that are freaking out, that some Darwinian forces could be at work where you're not, let's say, directly infringing on the franchise laws but you're dancing close as you probably should, given all the technological changes over the past 70 or 80 years since these laws came. So what's your message to them? What if order book goes to 80% of your units or the majority and then the dealers are just the delivery centers, and then you're going direct on all the other wonderful services? What's the message to the dealers?"

We're going to have our professional dealers, and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers. We'll have our rural dealers and the answer is a little bit different for them than the suburban urban dealers. The -- I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together so -- because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example. So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life. That's one. 
The second 1 is service, service, service, service. That is the most important thing for us is wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers and the customer is going to be the most important valet we're going to have to play together with the dealers. This is especially true for Ford Pro. And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business, warranty work. That's a good example of the evolution of the business model where they're taking their service department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity. And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics, our parts legacy system to order parts and the dealers on a dispatch system. That has to be a closed loop. 
So all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win just like maybe targets a chance to win versus the online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers."

We have 5 more EU countries covered by the end of the year to launch. So we're really excited about FORDLiive. What we've committed to so far is in the next couple of years, by 2025, we expect our digital and charging revenue in Ford Pro to be about $1 billion. Today, I wish we had more time to focus on this, frankly. We have about just under 200,000 unique subscriptions for our telematics and data services. We grew at about 20,000 units in the core, 20,000 subscriptions in the quarter. 
And we feel like that digital telematics and selling data like fuel tank information, plus adding the charging services like Electriphi for depot charging for our customers, are high-growth area with the revenue to that level in the next couple of years. The monetization of FORDLiive is really around our traditional parts business, which is very high margins and we have a very low share. So the opportunity for us upside is tremendous. Post warranty, even in our commercial customers, we get very few of those customers.

To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're talking about 50 to 60 days of inventory in the future because that's done much lower than what we've had in the past. And I would have thought the order bank would actually enable you to actually carry much less inventory and we've seen the benefit of that to pricing. So I wonder if the 50, 60 days kind of the first step that you think you can do better in the future. 
And along those lines, and then maybe more on the Ford Credit side, but when I look at European car companies, they carry more finished products on their balance sheet, the core balance sheet and then relatively less on the finco balance sheet through the dealer receivables they use as a proxy. Is the opposite in the U.S.? And I'm just wondering, if you look at a situation where you go to more order banking for your production, if you end up carrying more inventory on your industrial balance sheet, which would increase your working capital requirement from an industrial standpoint. That was my first question. 
And the second one, if I can ask briefly on China. It seems like you're stalling a bit in China. And because you've localized a lot more of Lincoln, more profitable, you had big losses in consolidated side before. And I'm just wondering, can you comment maybe on what is happening generally in China? Is there -- there seems to be a concern about how the Chinese brands are making good progress. Some of the EVs launched by your competitors are not quite getting the love from customers that was expected.

Then on the days supply, what we've seen in the past is around a 75-day supply, so 50 days, it's a 25-day reduction. So we do see that as substantial. And of course, that will be different across the different vehicle lines. So we do see that as a substantial pullback in the days supply."

In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss, hovering around breakeven now or slightly below that. And we're in a very important time for Ford in China. Lincoln is now profitable and we just localized those models. We only launched Lincoln in 2015. I was there. So it's a recent phenomena.

But I think we also know right now that, and maybe this is just a function of the market, but ICE sales are extremely strong in the U.S. It could remain the case for a while. 
So what should we expect on margin for ICE vehicles, especially as some of that investment comes down? Is it possible that the outgoing margin on some of the ICE vehicles actually increases and you could potentially run into a negative mix issue as we -- as you start to pivot from ICE to the BEVs?"

It's a good question. Generally speaking, that certainly could happen. We don't know how the demand will shift. Obviously, our guess is 40% of our mix, 240-gigawatt capacity by 2030. So we're busy making all that happen, as you say. 40% is a lot high",315,"Yes. It's a good question. Generally speaking, that certainly could happen. We don't know how the demand will shift. Obviously, our guess is 40% of our mix, 240-gigawatt capacity by 2030. So we're busy making all that happen, as you say. 40% is a lot higher than today. And I think we have -- well, I know we have the right strategy for the company. 
But so much of this transition is going to depend on government support, infrastructure build-out. And we need to be patient and I think agility will become a very important skill for the company. So far, the first inning would imply that Ford's #1 in sports cars in Mustang. We're #1 in vans with Transit. We're #1 in pickups with F-150. We're electrifying all 3 of those in the next 6 months. And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected. 
So I don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. The support in China but especially in Europe has accelerated the BEV adoption in those regions. But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEVs, it's hard to say. And it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level over time. 
I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending because that's enough. It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy, the agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement and the vertical integration for key electric components and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others. I know it's a very general answer, but I don't think we know enough to answer your question."

Early in the second quarter 2 months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future of Ford. Put simply, our Ford+ plan is focused on 2 things: really distinctive products that only Ford could do; and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that gets better and better over time. 
We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence and the industry's best captive finance company, but we're now adding new capabilities and new talents and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors. We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software and a lot more. Ford+ also means introducing the industry's most compelling high-volume electric vehicle lineup and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components. And with Argo AI, we're well positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential.  
But fundamental to transforming Ford is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market. Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter after quarter, year after year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment, like we did in the second quarter. Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our team skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT. And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter. It required intense focus from our team on cost, pricing and mix.  
The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio, and it's about to get a lot stronger. We stopped making me-too products in declining segments a few years ago, and we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford. The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the United States, was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y Performance, the Porsche Taycan and the Audi e-tron.  
The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections. The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past 120,000 units, and 75% of those customers are new to Ford. We are now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red-hot, new battery electric vehicles. We're working with LG Chem, SKI Innovation (sic) [ SK Innovation ] to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%, and we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of the E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year.  
The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable. In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco 2- and 4-door models, and 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford. And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup that offers room for 5, gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000. And customers already recognize the value of this product, and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders.  
Great products alone are not sufficient though to deliver Ford+. Always-on means we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities like connected services to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams. We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we call Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the air. Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems. We do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle. 
For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to connected services like FordPass, are now over 95%. We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over the year just this year, and we expect this -- to top 600,000 vehicles by year-end. And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world. And we're mining the real-world data from these vehicles real time to better meet our customer needs. To me, this is the most important point. For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities. 
We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from $45 billion in 2025 from $27 billion in 2019. Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption by offering those customers the best scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers. It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now.  
In Mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large-scale commercialization of Ford's AVs. Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry-first collaboration between Argo and Lyft to deploy Ford driverless vehicles on the Lyft TNC network. This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo's ability to connect into multiple TNCs, or transportation networks.  
And on the technology front, Argo -- I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo Lidar, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on. This new lidar, designed to be cost-effective and manufacturing at scale, will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance-sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection or safe highway driving.  
Now before John reports on the quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation. In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT. In fact, we did better than expected. We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits. We're seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid especially due to the delay in ramp-up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half. Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand and improving chip supply. 
Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford. We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy. What does that mean? We're placing a greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks. We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible but it's better for customers, dealers and Ford. But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online so we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank. This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives and reduce our order complexity and the industrial systems cost. For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want. Now this isn't theoretical. I hope we get into the Q&A. We're doing it right now as we speak.  
Relative to the supply chain, we made 3 notable changes. First, we are no longer relying on -- heavily on a tiered procurement structure for transparency. We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in the supply chain for our critical components, electronic components. With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information such as technology road maps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand. 
Second, we are providing longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements. 
And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain. Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing and design interchangeability in the case of single sources. These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford. Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation, called Blue Oval SK, will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical, given our demand for our new electric vehicles. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook."

So first, I want to reiterate that everything we do and every decision we are making, including capital allocation, is squarely focused on delivering our Ford+ plan. And you'll see that as I share our key takeaways from the quarter, our full year outlook and describe how we are positioned for even a stronger performance heading into 2022. And as Jim said, we delivered better-than-expected results, given the semiconductor constraints. 
Year-over-year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlapped the industry-wide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year. Now for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparisons, and we think those are more appropriate. While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized for revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management. We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches and our more profitable vehicles. In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence in our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesales and share.  
So let's turn to our results. On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year-over-year, respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of $1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%. Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors, and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint as well as lower costs. And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of $1.6 billion, and that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford+. And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services and EV charging. And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us.  
Now turning to the regions. North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesales due to the semiconductor shortage. Now as we manage the chip constraints, we've focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery. We exited the second quarter with our U.S. customer sold order bank up more than 7x compared to a year ago. And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand. On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up $1.1 billion.  
Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track. In aggregate, EBIT improved $800 million year-over-year but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%. The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports. Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including $1 billion for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring, and a new, all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania.  
In South America, our restructuring is on track. Our lean, derisked and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with Ranger, Transit and key imported vehicles. The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach 1 in selected markets and is preparing now for the launch of the new Transit van in the second half of this year.  
In China, we continued to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles and with our portfolio of near-premium Ford vehicles. Lincoln attained its highest-ever quarterly sales, was profitable and also captured the #1 spot in J.D. Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking, unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years. In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of overall sales mix in China. And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year.  
Our International Markets Group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV. And we're continuing to assess our business in India, and we'll have more to say on this later this year.  
Company-wide, second quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative $5.1 billion. As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances for marketing incentives. Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of $4 billion in the quarter. Now we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored. Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at $25.1 billion and $41 billion, respectively. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford+ plan.  
So now let's turn to the outlook. Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion. Now this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors. Our guidance implies we are -- we expect second half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year. And so we provided a bridge to help with this, and we've included that on Page 19 of our earnings presentation. 
So let me provide a little bit of color around this. Relative to tailwinds, we expect about $3 billion to $4 billion in favorable market factors, net of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes. Headwinds, right? We see headwinds coming through, and we see pressure on contribution margin. We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion half-over-half. Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half, up about $500 million, though we still expect full year warranty expense to be down year-over-year. Relative to structural costs, about $1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches. 
Looking at Ford Credit, based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about $1 billion as auction values begin to normalize, and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half. And lastly, we also have the nonrecurrence of the $900 million noncash gain on Rivian we booked in the first quarter. And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022.  
We are also increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow target to $4 billion to $5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement in chip availability. Now as our operating results improve, so does our cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%. And the strength in cash conversion and our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs, Ford Pro, our connected services and Mobility.  
Now looking towards 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leverage one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford+ plan. We're on a new path at Ford. We've got a plan, the resources and the resolve to build a better business. 
So now I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions."

But what we also see heading into next year, a few headwinds. Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see. And that's because we see auction values coming down, and then we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well. We also see that next year, as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation. Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well.

Put simply, what we've learned about our very large order bank for Lightning is way over-indexed on the Coast. Almost 80% are new to Ford. What's interesting, 2 out of 5 are people who are going to trade in an ICE pickup, which is very important because it indicates a move a little bit faster to full-size truck BEV than maybe our optimistic assumptions. And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford but they aren't new to this segment. These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles. What is really interesting for me is someone would portray the full-size truck industry as kind of a conservative customer. That's not what we're seeing. These very large order bank for F-150 Lightning, they're new to BEV and they are excited to move to BEV. And they are -- more than half of them are pickup truck customers."

So in the second half, we show the net number there for the volume, net of the manufacturing production costs and other market factors. So what we are assuming is that in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we start to see some moderation in pricing due to the fact that we should see volumes and inventories and stocks coming up a bit. So that is something that we do have built into that number for the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up now -- up and running now, launched now. As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there. And then F-150 Lightning, Maverick, they're launching next year. So our product portfolio is strong today, is going to be even stronger next year.

Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order-based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days supply. I've been here at Ford for 13 years. There were many years after the financial crisis where our days supply was 20, 30, 40 days. And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S. was 1,000 to 2,000 a month. We are now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units. That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we're looking at this order bank change for the company. 
A lot of people in our industry are making a big deal about the move online, sure. But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system. You put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly. It reduces our dealers' costs more than just low days supply as you mentioned. It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives. And I guarantee you -- I don't know how much money we're wasting. I know we're wasting money on incentives. I just don't know where. With an order-based system, we will have much less risk of that. It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well. So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach. I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I've tried to give you the high hard ones."

So I'm just curious how you decide where that balance lands, how you keep the inventory tight, your partners' dealership happy and selling and creating value for you. But then also a big part of the story is the tightness in the secondary market, in the used market is keeping receipts high, which is helping the new vehicle price and it's certainly helping out at Ford Motor Credit. So I mean there's kind of a seesaw effect here to get the benefit on both sides. I just -- how do you figure out where this should land and how you actually execute on it?"

Our target is 50 to 60 days supply. That means trucks will be a little bit higher. We have a lot -- about 1/3 of our truck dealers in C and D county. 5 trucks to them could be 100 days supply but they need 5 trucks for the local community. And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range. Different segments will have different targets. We actually did this post financial crisis for a few years and then, over time, lost discipline. And this is quite important for this management team. We have a weekly and a monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions. 
That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment. Going to an order bank, I would say, is a hardwired way of reducing the stock. And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition. It can't be just relying on management keeping within that range. We certainly will have exception -- an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams. But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order-to-delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift because for Bronco and Mach-E and some of the other high-demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system. We then realized, ""My God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles?"" And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes, like order complexity reduction in the system, to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford. I think it's going to require both changes."

Of course, we're a dominant commercial brand in multiple regions like Western Europe and the U.S., even in China in certain segments. And we're seeing, in Europe, a very dramatic order bank on our vans. It is something I've never seen in my career. We're talking months and months and months of back orders. So the demand for our commercial vehicles in Europe is extremely strong. The order bank is months and months. In the U.S., we're very fortunate that our commercial business is heavily focused on Transit and Super Duty. And of course, F-150 is kind of mixed. And so for those vehicle lines, Transit and Super Duty is very easy to -- we don't have to prioritize between retail and commercial because those vehicle lines are almost 100% commercial. 
The one that's challenging for us to balance is F-150. And we -- as you could see in this quarter, we're very carefully mix-managing, but we are very respectful of the needs of our commercial customers. We know where our toast is buttered. And those customers are really important for us. In fact, we are in discussions with them right now about the trade-off between feature content and availability. We have many commercial customers in the U.S. that have been waiting for months and months for the vehicle. And we are discussing with them, ""Would you be willing to take off feature content to get your vehicles now?"" And that's -- and you can expect us to be balanced about that discussion and negotiation and compromise. It's -- and it's -- we'll make the right call for the company and for the customer, but they are pushing us for availability now even if it means lower feature content."

We're going to have our professional dealers, and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers. We'll have our rural dealers, and the answer is a little bit different for them than the suburban urban dealers. The -- I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together so -- because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example. So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life. That's one. 
The second one is service, service, service. That is the most important thing for us. It's wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers, and the customer is going to be the most important ballet we're going to have to play together with the dealers. This is especially true for Ford Pro. And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business, warranty work. That's a good example of the evolution of the business model where they're taking their service department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity. And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics, our parts legacy system to order parts, and the dealers on dispatch system. That has to be a closed loop. So all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win just like maybe targets a chance to win versus the online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers."

I can see from the global walk on Slide 9 that net pricing helped EBIT by $1.9 billion or kind of like 10% of last year's revenue, which seems to suggest of the idea that like half of the growth in revenue over unit volume in 2Q was driven by price and the other half by mix. Is that roughly correct? And what do you think the outlook is for continuing to grow revenue in excess of the change in volume?"

And I think as long as the -- you see this imbalance between supply and demand, you'll continue to have stronger pricing power, as we've seen through the first quarter and the second quarter. As we go through the year and we start to see supply and demand normalize, we'll see some of this pricing come off a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then we have to see how that runs through next year.

The first one, sorry, go back on these order bank and inventory levels. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're talking about 50 to 60 days of inventory in the future because that's not much lower than what we've had in the past. And I would have thought the order bank would actually enable you to actually carry much less inventory, and we've seen the benefit of that to pricing. So I wonder if the 50, 60 days kind of the first step that you think you can do better in the future. 
And along those lines and then maybe more on the Ford Credit side, but when I look at European car companies, they carry more finished products on their balance sheet, the core balance sheet, and then relatively less on the finco balance sheet through the dealer receivables they use as a proxy. Is the opposite in the U.S.? And I'm just wondering, if you look at a situation where you go to more order banking for your production, if you end up carrying more inventory on your industrial balance sheet, which would increase your working capital requirement from an industrial standpoint. That was my first question. 
And the second one, if I can ask briefly on China. It seems like you're stalling a bit in China. And because you've localized a lot more of Lincoln, more profitable, you had big losses in consolidated side before. And I'm just wondering, can you comment maybe on what is happening generally in China? Is -- there seems to be a concern about how the Chinese brands are making good progress. Some of the EVs launched by your competitors are not quite getting the love from customers that was expected.

It would increase working capital. We'd use it to drive down working capital. 
Then on the days supply, what we've seen in the past is around a 75-days supply. So 50 days, it's a 25-day reduction. So we do see that as substantial. And of course, that will be different across the different vehicle lines. So we do see that as a substantial pullback in the days supply."

In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss, hovering around breakeven now or slightly below that. And we're in a very important time for Ford in China. Lincoln is now profitable, and we just localized those models. We only launched Lincoln in 2015. I was there. So it's a recent phenomenon. And we're just about to launch a whole plethora of brand-new vehicles like we're doing in North America today. So we're on the eve of the Mustang Mach-E launch, localized. And then we have all these new vehicles, the EVOS. I can go on a long list. And it will be just like what we're seeing in North America, full freshness, and that will play out over the next couple of years. So China is very important for our profit plans.

And we need to be patient, and I think agility will become a very important skill for the company. 
So far, the first inning would imply that Ford is #1 in sports cars, Mustang. We're #1 in vans with Transit. We're #1 in pickups with F-150. We're electrifying all 3 of those in the next 6 months. And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected. So I don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen.

But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEVs. It's hard to say and it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level over time. 
I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending because that's enough. It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy, the agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement and the vertical integration for key electric components and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others.

Well, this month marks 1 year since we began executing our Ford+ plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford, with world-class talent recruited from outside of our company, specific talent, specific people that are largely outside of our industry. This leadership team is committed to this plan, and we're accelerating our progress. 
Now Ford+ is not a tagline. It's not advertising. It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bring value to our customers. We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only Ford can do, increasingly always on relationships with our customers and ever-improving user experiences, all while creating value for our shareholders. We're fully vested in this future, and we're taking big swings. 
Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity. We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles, not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle. That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation. 
We're scaling the number of vehicles capable [indiscernible] their updates. We'll be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028. That's scale. 
At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S. In fact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year, and I think we'll need more. 
Our $7 billion investment in BlueOval City in Tennessee and the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale, sustainability, advanced manufacturing and training the next generation of technology leaders. At the same time, the $1 billion of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon. That center will be all electric by 2023. 
We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning, the defining zero-emission version of America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40-plus years. 
Our all-electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand. Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a make to other customers, critical as a new generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices. 
Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world where we are just starting production of Mach-E. We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year. 
We've created a new organization, Ford Pro, to change and power the future work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution and services, while growing revenues to Ford. In the few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version of the world's best-selling commercial van. 
And in the third quarter alone, Ford Live, Europe's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the U.K. secure additional uptime, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers. 
We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick. In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon, I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the United States. It's also America's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup. This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I've ever seen from any mass market brand in my career. 
And we are creating a spring-loaded future as we emerge from the chip shortages and COVID constraints, and we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles. In the second quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft. And in the third quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart. This is Walmart's first ever multicity autonomous delivery service, and it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations, not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles. In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI's aspiration to access public capital. 
To build this future and generate the margins and cash flow we need to fund Ford+, we had to turn around our automotive operations and improve our competitiveness. Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress. In fact, company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America. Those margins, I'll remind you, are in line with our targets for 2023. More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post their best performance in 4 years. Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign. We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements, including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high-profit vehicles. 
Now before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts. I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value. You are already seeing a favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow. There is more to come. 
Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBIT guidance to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on Ford's potential. 
The word I would leave you with is focus. The competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough, and we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a Challenger, focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford+ growth with customers at the very center of everything we do. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities and our expectations heading into next year. John?"
106335,1682804941,2414733,"Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Credit Company LLC, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Ford Motor Company","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with $3",1525,"Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with $3 billion in adjusted company EBIT and a margin of 8.4%. Free cash flow of $7.7 billion was, as we expected, up sharply on a sequential basis driven by the positive working capital effects from higher wholesale and EBIT. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over $31 billion and $47 billion, respectively. 
Now across our Automotive business, our playbook remains consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches and our most profitable vehicles. And as expected, on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically as chip supply for Ford improved. We also remain disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which, on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume. 
Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with $1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong and credit losses continue at near-record lows. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale. We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the third quarter. Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect planned sequential increases in our Ford+ modernization investments, including customer experience and IT. 
So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation and our preliminary view of 2022. With improved chip supply, North America wholesale increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built but waiting for chips. Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles. The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter and reaching a high of 31% in September. And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the second quarter to more than 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco. With a 10.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%. 
South America marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, and the business run rate is now approaching breakeven. The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay. This transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature. 
In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen, though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement. In the third quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBIT. Our leadership as the #1 commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter, along with an extremely robust order bank. 
In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment luxury. With retail sales up 24% year-over-year, in fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months. Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end. 
In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing following accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years. Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs. And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including Ranger. 
Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBIT guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, and that's despite a lower-than-anticipated improvement in chip availability in the second half of the year. Consistent with our adjusted EBIT guidance through this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million noncash gain on our investment in Rivian in our first quarter adjusted results. 
So let me spend a minute on Rivian. Now in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments as special items. Accordingly, we will recast the $900 million noncash gain from adjusted EBIT in the first quarter to a special item. If Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022. 
Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at $4 billion to $5 billion, reflecting the higher EBIT, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing difference -- timing differences. Now this is due to lower-than-anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints. We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences. 
So now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework. Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford+ plan. Ultimately, it ensures we return value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends. 
Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend. Our Board has approved restarting a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford+ plan. The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment. 
To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about $40 billion to $45 billion or a run rate of roughly $7 billion per year. Now over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEVs. And of the investment in BEVs, about 50% is CapEx, 25% is expense and 25% is direct investments. And these numbers, they'll be the dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investment even if BEV adoption further accelerates. 
Now let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year, which, like this one, is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes. Now we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon, and we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year given the dynamic operating environment. 
Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021. First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional, and we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplates. Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates. Third, driven by the chip shortage, the roughly $4 million in wholesales we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity. And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales could be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly. And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial. We have drastically de-risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process. 
Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing, and this will continue to remain dynamic. For 2021, we expect commodities to be up $3 billion to $3.5 billion, and they could be up another $1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year. There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now. Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease and return rates. 
And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford+ plan for growth and value creation, and this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. And of course, we believe the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. 
Now that wraps up our prepared remarks. And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right. And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting accordingly. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your minds. Thank you."

There's an assumption that price and mix will deteriorate, and incremental units are produced as the semi shortage is relieved. But given that, that's still going to be a relatively low -- a very low level of production, do you believe that the price and mix are really going to actually come under pressure next year? And aren't we really going to stay in a very tight environment that you're selling through and not even building inventory, if that's true, which means that price and mix might stay very strong next year and still get the benefit?"

So that's going to be the key. 
The other thing I would say, John, is that the move, as we talked about in our remarks, to having more of our sales come through orders, online orders in the order bank, that's really important for us to manage our day supply so that it's less of a ground stock push through and it's customer demand pull-through based on the orders.

It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system like in manufacturing. We have 3 complete hits on our hands, a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand. That's -- we have the Lightning with over 160,000 orders, and the E-Trans is completely sold out. So how I like to think about it, it's not just the product creation speeding up.

The question really is how we maintain it, as you said, as the market improves. And the way we're looking at that is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain or prefer a order-based system. That means we train our system to put in orders. We reward people for putting in orders. We dynamically price for customers so that they're incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot. So it's going to be a journey. It's been a very rewarding one so far, and we're just beginning. This is the model we have to go through as most of our business or majority of our business goes battery electric and digital. It's the right loyalty model."

It seems as was discussed earlier that product development times are speeding up, maybe particularly with regard to EVs. The Lightning, for example, seem to come together very fast. Another trend seems to be that automakers are revealing their EVs for a longer period of time before the actual start of production, maybe because they're so eager to show them, consumers are so clamoring for them.

The one thing I would actually to think about is that most of the fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles. And the most important commercial vehicles for us is small, medium-sized businesses, and those are very profitable business for us. for transit for Super Duty. That's where Ford excels in the fleet business and it's smaller fleets. It's not big fleet sales. 
So the texture of this is that we're revenue-managing the company very carefully. We know the margins by geography, even within the country, and we know by distribution channel. So this is a very thoughtful approach for us. But strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have we're reliable partner with fleet customers. They do business with companies that are reliable. They don't come in and out of the market. They do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services. That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro and why we're vertically integrating our services.

We also see a little bit stronger mix continuing. And then, of course, you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that. But net-net, market factors net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive. 
What we're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4, are commodities. We expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they're going to be up about $700 million. And if you look at that so far year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us. And when you get to the fourth quarter, you can get the [indiscernible] effect of that.

So our first job is, of course, post job one customer experience improvement. Post job one simplification and improvement of the cost of the vehicle. And post job one quality improvements using the data off the vehicles. But perhaps our biggest job, in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain so we can get these products out to these customers. And that post job one orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ICE business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes.

First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford's strategy is our commercial business. In that business where vehicles are highly utilized, our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors. 
I'll give you some statistics. We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the United States and 850 transit centers across Europe. That will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate. Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades in those locations for our Ford vehicles. So the dealer body is not only important for the aftersales experience and making sure those vehicles can be serviced, but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products. So the dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers. 
There's no doubt that many customers want a 3 or 4-click, very easy service experience on the retail side. And we're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform. And actually, in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year. So we're starting to experiment. 
I think our dealers have served us really well. I'm very proud of them. I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer. And we are very vigilant. You can imagine, I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products, and we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers."

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, this month marks 1 year since we began executing our Ford+ plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a s",1082,"Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Well, this month marks 1 year since we began executing our Ford+ plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford, with world-class talent recruited from outside of our company, specific talent, specific people that are largely outside of our industry. This leadership team is committed to this plan, and we're accelerating our progress. 
Now, Ford+ is not a tagline. It's not advertising. It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bring value to our customers. We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only Ford can do, increasingly always on relationships with our customers and ever-improving user experiences, all while creating value for our shareholders. We're fully vested in this future, and we're taking big swings. 
Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity. We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles, not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle. That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation. 
We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over their updates. We'll be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028. That's scale. 
At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S. In fact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year, and I think we'll need more. 
Our $7 billion investment in BlueOval City in Tennessee and the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale, sustainability, advanced manufacturing and training the next generation of technology leaders. At the same time, the $1 billion of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon. That center will be all electric by 2023. 
We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning, the defining zero-emission version of America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40-plus years. 
Our all-electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand. Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers, critical as a new generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices. 
Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world where we are just starting production of Mach-E. We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year. 
We've created new organization, Ford Pro, to change and power the future work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution and services, while growing revenues to Ford. In the few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version of the world's best-selling commercial van. 
And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the U.K. secure additional uptime, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers. 
We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick. In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon, I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the United States. It's also America's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup. This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I've ever seen from any mass market brand in my career. 
And we are creating a spring-loaded future as we emerge from the chip shortages and COVID constraints, and we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles. 
In the second quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft. And in the third quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart. This is Walmart's first-ever multicity autonomous delivery service, and it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations, not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles. In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI's aspiration to access public capital. 
To build this future and generate the margins and cash flow we need to fund Ford+, we had to turn around our automotive operations and improve our competitiveness. Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress. In fact, company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America. Those margins, I'll remind you, are in line with our targets for 2023. 
More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post their best performance in 4 years. Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign. We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements, including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high-profit vehicles. 
Now before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts. I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value. You are already seeing a favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow. There is more to come. 
Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBIT guidance to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on Ford's potential. 
The word I would leave you with is focus. The competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough, and we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger, focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford+ growth with customers at the very center of everything we do. 
Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities and our expectations heading into next year. John?"

Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with $3",1524,"Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with $3 billion in adjusted company EBIT and a margin of 8.4%. 
Free cash flow of $7.7 billion was, as we expected, up sharply on a sequential basis driven by the positive working capital effects from higher wholesale and EBIT. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over $31 billion and $47 billion, respectively. 
Now across our Automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches and our most profitable vehicles. And as expected, on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically as chip supply for Ford improved. We also remain disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which, on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume. 
Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with $1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong and credit losses continue at near-record lows. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale. We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the third quarter. Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect planned sequential increases in our Ford+ modernization investments, including customer experience and IT. 
So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation and our preliminary view of 2022. With improved chip supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built but waiting for chips. Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles. The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter and reaching a high of 31% in September. And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the second quarter to more than 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco. With a 10.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%. 
South America marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, and the business run rate is now approaching breakeven. The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new Transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay. This Transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature. 
In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen, though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement. In the third quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBIT. Our leadership as the #1 commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter, along with an extremely robust order bank. 
In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment luxury. With retail sales up 24% year-over-year, in fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months. Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford Select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end. 
In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing following accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years. Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs. And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including Ranger. 
Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBIT guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, and that's despite a lower-than-anticipated improvement in chip availability in the second half of the year. Consistent with our adjusted EBIT guidance through this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million noncash gain on our investment in Rivian in our first quarter adjusted results. 
So let me spend a minute on Rivian. Now in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments as special items. Accordingly, we will recast the $900 million noncash gain from adjusted EBIT in the first quarter to a special item. If Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022. 
Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at $4 billion to $5 billion, reflecting the higher EBIT, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing difference -- timing differences. Now this is due to lower-than-anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints. We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences. 
So now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework. Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford+ plan. Ultimately, it ensures we return value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends. 
Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend. Our Board has approved restarting a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford+ plan. The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment. 
To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about $40 billion to $45 billion or a run rate of roughly $7 billion per year. Now over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEVs. And of the investment in BEVs, about 50% is CapEx, 25% is expense and 25% is direct investments. And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investment, even if BEV adoption further accelerates. 
Now let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year, which, like this one, is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes. Now we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon, and we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment. 
Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021. First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional, and we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplates. 
Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates. 
Third, driven by the chip shortage to roughly $4 million in wholesales we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity. And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales could be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly. 
And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial. We have drastically de-risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process. 
Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing, and this will continue to remain dynamic. For 2021, we expect commodities to be up $3 billion to $3.5 billion, and they could be up another $1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year. There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now. 
Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease and return rates. 
And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford+ plan for growth and value creation, and this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. And of course, we believe the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. 
Now that wraps up our prepared remarks. And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right. And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting, accordingly. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your minds. Thank you."

The other thing I would say, John, is that the move, as we talked about in our remarks, to having more of our sales come through orders, online orders in the order bank, that's really important for us to manage our day supply so that it's less of a ground stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders. And we had over 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter, and that's grown since then in our order bank. And that played well for us in the third quarter."

But the question I ask myself is a little different. When we see a technology change like this -- like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation. It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system like in manufacturing. We have 3 complete hits on our hands, a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand. That's -- we have the Lightning with over 160,000 orders, and the E-Transit is completely sold out.

Number two, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest fixed marketing. Number three, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system. 
You cannot imagine, Ryan, how much money we waste by not -- by guessing what our launch mix is for a new product. When you have an order bank, especially for new models, you could capacitize the high series mix that are very profitable right in line with customer demand. So it's incredibly cost-effective, and it allows you to address the long-tail revenues that we have lost in the past because of our internal ground stock model. 
And the last one is, it's lower cost. There's less parts hanging around. We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing in a leaner way. The question really is, how we maintain it, as you said, as the market improves. And the way we're looking at that is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain or prefer a order-based system. That means we train our system to put in orders. We reward people for putting in orders. We dynamically price for customers so that they're incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot. So it's going to be a journey. It's been a very rewarding one so far, and we're just beginning.

And kind of related to that, as you kind of think about prioritizing production, are there models where you're more comfortable you'll get good price retention, and other models, and I'm going to pick on like the Escape maybe that have a lot of competition in their segment and as capacity comes back less likely to hold price, say, compared to a Bronco."

We're going to continue to think about vehicles as a service and what that potential holds for us as that business model changes, and we'll see where that takes us.

I was just going to say, our fleet business now, now that we've rationalized the company, our fleet business is very strategic for us. It's also very profitable. It certainly varies in Europe and North America and China. Different fleet segments have different profitability. 
The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of the fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles. And the most important commercial vehicles for us is small, medium-sized businesses, and those are very profitable business for us. For Transit for Super Duty. That's where Ford excels in the fleet business and its smaller fleets. It's not big fleet sales. 
So the texture of this is that we're revenue-managing the company very carefully. We know the margins by geography, even within the country, and we know by distribution channel. So this is a very thoughtful approach for us. But strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have -- we're reliable partner with fleet customers. They do business with companies that are reliable. They don't come in and out of the market. They do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services. That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro and why we're vertically integrating our services. 
So I think we have a really good profitable fleet business around the world. We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the company to be a reliable partner."

And so what you're seeing flow through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, et cetera. 
So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive. We said we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10%. We also see a little bit stronger mix continuing. And then, of course, you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that. But net-net, market factors net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive. 
What we're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4, are commodities. We expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they're going to be up about $700 million. And if you look at that, so far year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us. And when you get to the fourth quarter, and you get the cumulative effect of that. On a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. So year-over-year, up $1.5 billion, sequentially, up $700 million. 
And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages. But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter and full year on a year-over-year basis. Our warranty, we expect to be good by about $1.4 billion."

So we're not going to give a number at this point, Itay, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing from Mach-E, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units. We've got the Bronco and Maverick, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning are coming. It's the best lineup we've had. And so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year. And you're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that, but we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about and the other puts and takes. 
But what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023. And so we will manage into next year. These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint, strengths, and all the tailwinds and then the headwinds. And we will manage that next year, and we'll be on the path next year towards our 8% target in 2020."

The first one, very pleased to see beyond a target and -- for this 8% margin by 2023, a big focus of the company and clearly showing some progress there. How should we think about the impact on this from the margins on your electric vehicles? Obviously, the scale takes some time to build up, but you're going through that right now and probably have some level of visibility. So what's your lead to thinking around trajectory for margins on some of your BEVs? And to what extent you will or will not impact overall company margins and potentially how do we think about it beyond 2023?"

Such an important question for the company. I'd like John to comment on the margins. Right now, we have 3 high-volume, very well-accepted battery electric vehicles on our hands, Mach-E, E-Transit and the F-150 Lightning. So the way we look at it is, we want to grow this business really fast. Just the Mach-E demand itself, we think, is 200,000 units. That does not include the Lightning or the E-Transit. 
So our first job is, of course, post job 1 customer experience improvement. Post job 1 simplification and improvement of the cost of the vehicle. And post job 1 quality improvements using the data off the vehicles. 
But perhaps our biggest job, in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain so we can get these products out to these customers. And that post job 1 orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ICE business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes. 
The constraint from Mach-E right now is batteries. We think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get batteries from China. So stay tuned, and I'll ask John to comment on the margins."

For us to truly disrupt personal ownership, we have to democratize shared mobility.

It's different than our competitors in the space. We've gone to the most difficult miles in 4, 5 different cities. 
Our mapping, our SDS deployment and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment. So we're not going to a small market area in easy miles like others. We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly. And I think that's always been our approach. 
The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now, and we're really ready for that. And we think this will take more capital and a little more time, and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey."

First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford's strategy is our commercial business. In that business where vehicles are highly utilized, our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors. 
I'll give you some statistics. We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the United States and 850 transit centers across Europe. That will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate. Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades in those locations for our Ford vehicles. 
So the dealer body is not only important for the aftersales experience in making sure those vehicles can be serviced, but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products. So the dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers. 
There's no doubt that many customers want a 3 or 4-click, very easy service experience on the retail side. And we're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform. And actually, in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year. So we're starting to experiment. 
I think our dealers have served us really well. I'm very proud of them. I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer. And we are very vigilant. You can imagine, I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products. And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers."
