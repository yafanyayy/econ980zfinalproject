So I particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk as we always try to be. 
Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4% while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E*TRADE, received an upgrade from Moody's to A2, we're placed on review for upgrade second time and announced our intent to acquire Eaton Vance. 
Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test result, we announced a $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point. 
Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first, let me walk you through our vision for the next decade and outlook focused on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now done since, I believe, 2012. 
Let's turn to Slide 3. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress and delivering strong results when markets are active. 2020, for sure, tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs. 
We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014. 
Turn to Slide 4. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth with several strategic acquisitions. In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. And in 2020, we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. Combining with E*TRADE positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable economic way. E*TRADE's technology, products and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E*TRADE serves a younger demographic, who are on average over 10 years younger than those we've historically served and we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex. 
With Eaton Vance, we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution. 
Please turn to Slide #5. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing and stability, our firm is now at an inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all 3 of our business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share; expanding and deepening our client relationships; realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage; and finally, returning capital to our shareholders. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Scale in our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver, gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis. Our wealth and asset management  platform is among the largest globally with over $5 trillion in combined assets. Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet as you can see on Slide 7. 
Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage and are capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020, International Securities generated over $300 million of revenues from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management, in turn, gained $20 billion of client assets, and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments, all from Institutional Securities referrals. 
Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities on Slide 8. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth, coupled with risk and expense discipline, was an operating margin of 35%. 
Turn to Slide 9, which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E*TRADE, we are now a top 3 player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances, and each presents unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households. 
If we look at E*TRADE on Slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records across all materials -- all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled, and net new assets more than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy E*TRADE was indeed the right one. 
On Slide 11, we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets this year new to our firm. That's 6% of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis. 
We've invested heavily over the years, building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology and building new businesses, and the addition of E*TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable. And while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, this is -- and this was likely at the high end of what is a likely range, we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels. 
On Slide 12, every year for the past decade, our revenues have increased. And with E*TRADE, our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That was compared to just 2% only 4 years ago. 
Let's talk about Investment Management on Slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion. And both MSIM and Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%. 
We're really excited about this transaction, and the integration planning is going well. Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong with increasing assets under management through the end of December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter. 
Slide 14 shows the power of our Wealth and Investment Management platforms when taken together. On a pro forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets are more than double the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly advice-driven business model, revenue on these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand side of the page, is materially higher than our 3 larger competitors. 
Now let's turn to Slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side, with the additional liquidity and deposits we've added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals, and they are outlined in a little bit detail down the right-hand side of this slide. 
So turning to 16. Expense discipline is a fundamental tenet of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just on 70% this past year. And obviously, that has driven the pretax profit expansion. 
So our fifth growth driver is highlighted on Page 17. Over the past several years, we've consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital. We're excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve. 
I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives, which are shown on Slide 18. While this year will be a transition year as we absorbed 2 major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and frankly, our belief is that Wealth Management will generate a margin over 30%. By 2022, we -- by 2022, and in that period, we expect to range from 26% to 30% as we continue to work through the E*TRADE integration. 
We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth, but we'll balance this with discipline. In so doing, we're keeping our long-term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69% to 72% over the next 2 years. 
Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also, of course, on capital distribution. In the meantime, we raised our 2-year target to the range of 14% to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook, and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now, we fully expect to achieve these as stated. 
That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to Jon, who's going to go through the fourth quarter and annual results. Then together, we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you."

We saw continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets, incredible volatility and consistent client engagement across all 3 businesses drove results. 
Excluding E*TRADE integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58, respectively. We continued to deliver on operating leverage in 2020 led by Institutional Securities. Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 15% driven by increased volume-related expenses and higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the full year were up 16%, resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73%. 
Now to the businesses. In Institutional Securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year. Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter, marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced, and clients remained active up until the week of Christmas. 
Investment Banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full year, 26% higher than 2019 driven by record underwriting revenues, particularly equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening of markets, beginning with debt and rescue financings, next with equity and very recently leveraged loans and corporate M&A financing. 
Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade, generating revenues of $2.3 billion, 46% higher versus the prior year driven by record underwriting and advisory results, with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates. Overall, the Investment Banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. 
The pace of M&A announcements has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in health care and technology and follow-on activity, notably in the Americas and Asia. After a record-breaking year in investment-grade and high-yield debt markets, strategic activity should support increased acquisition-related financing. 
In Equity sales and trading, we remain #1 globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full year revenues of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade. This year's market backdrop was unprecedented, and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity, elevated volatility and a double-digit increase in global market volumes. Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia. 
Fixed Income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade, increasing 69% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid/ask spreads. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion increased 31% year-over-year. Results in the quarter and full year were led by credit and foreign exchange. For the full year, Asia showed particular strength. 
Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plan. 
Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter as we continue to support our clients, while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline and is now closed to prepandemic levels. 
After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first 3 quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4. ISG provisions were $14 million, while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel. 
While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We derisked this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter, and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains stable, and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline. 
Turning to Wealth Management. On October 2, we closed our acquisition of E*TRADE. This quarter's results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E*TRADE revenues in transactional and NII. Making comparisons to prior periods are difficult, so I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on Page 7 regarding the combined business. 
In the quarter, revenues were $5.7 billion. Excluding integration-related expenses of $231 million, the PBT margin was 22.9%, and full year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong, reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity. 
We saw record fee-based flows of $77 billion for the year, and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth in 2020, and loans are nearly $100 billion. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and loans in forbearance are under $400 million, down from approximately $2 billion at the end of Q1. 
Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E*TRADE and are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter, and on a pro forma basis, over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisers and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisers. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future. 
In the quarter, asset management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated, and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both adviser-led and self-directed channels. 
Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with E*TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes the purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization, which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This year, NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates. 
On funding synergies, we onboarded approximately $4 billion of the deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4, and we expect to onboard approximately $20 billion in Q1. As we invest these deposits and shed higher-cost wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised higher funding benefits in NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions reflected in Q2. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII. 
Lastly, on rates, we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near term. However, we will benefit from the eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E*TRADE increases our U.S. bank's sensitivity to rates, and a 100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII compared to the estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition. 
We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over 3 years with approximately 40% to be realized this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured. 2021, we will be exiting the E*TRADE branches, consolidating our bank entities and integrating HR and finance systems. And we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies during the year. 
Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, representing the second-highest quarterly level in over a decade. For the full year, revenues were $3.7 billion, in line with the prior period but reflecting a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest. 
Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion. The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net flows of $41 billion for the year and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%. 
We are excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance. Across businesses and strategies, Eaton Vance's assets under management across -- excuse me, increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong, and their momentum continues. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.1 trillion, and standardized RWAs increased to $454 billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E*TRADE. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 17.4%. 
Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full year, respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in and around 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. 
We are pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipelines, engaged institutional and retail clients and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives. 
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

And it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions. Do you have an estimate of what that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate?

And as you pointed out, Brennan, it's the first time, I think, we've done it in many, many years. And we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth. I mean, we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with, frankly, in absolute dollars, modest assets, and we're able to bring in $200 billion in a year. 
Now part of that is obviously it's pro forma base. Part of that is if you look at what E*TRADE is doing, they're doing great. Part of it is if you're a net attrition of financial advisers, you will be a net attrition of assets on those advisers' books. For the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this, we're not in net attrition, which is interesting given the IFA channels continue to grow, but they're not growing from us. 
So we're keeping assets of our advisers. We're gaining assets from new advisers through the workplace initiatives, through Solium and E*TRADE. We're gaining assets from the conversion and keeping of those assets at a higher rate than we were. So it's a whole variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm. 
And it's no single thing. I do think 6% -- that's, as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number. But it's a long way from the 2% or the 3%, 4% we're operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2% and -- but maybe 6%, that feels high, certainly it's best-in-class to what The Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the disclosures."

The fee-based flows do exclude that as a function about how much fee-based assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset bases. Hopefully, that clarifies the question. And I think for us, the net new assets, given the different business models across -- the different business models that reflects most people don't have the level of asset-based fees when we thought it was appropriate to disclose that."

That's very helpful clarification and agree the growth rate looks robust. I mean, you regularly hear about how the traditional wealth management firms are just the providers of share, and certainly a mid-single-digit growth rate does not suggest you're providing seeding share to anybody. So agreed there. 
And then for my follow-up, sort of a related question, one of the things that a lot of people and myself included think is one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the wealth business is the stock plan business, where you really just have a strong position competitively. And you flagged a lot of that in the deck, which is really helpful. You talked about the retention opportunity of the 15-plus percent, which is what E*TRADE has pointed to historically. Are you -- what's the plan to integrate the stock plan platforms? How long do you think that might take? 
And is it right? When we think about the opportunity set, you've got the $435 billion of unvested assets. My guess is that's the opportunity set. About how much of that tends to vest per year? Is it about 1/4 or 30%? And it's right to think about that as evergreen, right? Like invest and then they're replaced with new awards in subsequent year. Sorry about the multipart question, but I think it's important."

I would highlight that there were certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small companies, private companies. And we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together. 
You're right. The existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets and roughly 5 million participants. Our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have, and therefore, the number of participants. And we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the E*TRADE transaction. So we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel. 
And then lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vest each year, I think that's a pretax number. So clearly, there's tax impacting that. But as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships."

So there's a lot of market activity, I think, in the reasonable near term. Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean, you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds, less than 50%. I think -- but who knows? I mean, the year has started off strong, and we count them 1 day at a time. 
And the year started off strong, the markets are active, the economies are recovering globally. New administration has come in. It looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So I'm quite optimistic about it. I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. 
Our Fixed Income franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Equities bounce and retained their #1 spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, that the banking revenue is above $2 billion for the quarter. There's a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. 
So I'm pretty optimistic. I mean, I can't put an exact number on it, but I certainly don't feel like we're going to make a major backstep at all here."

Our actual numbers of financial basis went up this quarter, I think, for the first time for years. So I just trend to the conservative until I see more data. 
And do I think it's going to fall back to 2%? Not at all. But if we could lock in 6% for the next 10 years, and we'd be -- we're bringing $200 billion a year. I read about a lot of these online players have got $20 billion in total, and we're bringing $20 billion every 5 weeks. So we're effectively creating these companies every 5 weeks. 
Now if it's going to be 4.5%, 5.5%, I don't know. I just -- my instinct is 6% on $4 trillion is a lot of assets to bring in, and I think it's doable. I'm not saying it's not doable, but I'm not projecting that, and I wouldn't want to guide you to that. On the other hand, I don't think we're going back to where -- I think we've got a different kind of company. 
The reason this -- the title of this presentation is called Morgan Stanley in an inflection point in the next decade of growth is if there's one message I would like people to take away from it is we are in the growth phase of this company for the next decade. We've been in, as we said, from the crisis forward, sort of fragility then healing and stability, and we are unambiguously in a growth phase. 
We have the capital to invest in our businesses. We're gaining share across our businesses. We've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency. And I believe we're in a growth phase in this company.

So as I think about it, I've described this before, half our company has that sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings. And we could clearly move the dividend higher and will once the regulators permit that. We have -- clearly, we have the capacity. 
On the book value, yes, I would actually have preferred to be buying stock last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that, but I'm not troubled by buying a little over book value. And I don't think we can be too cute. We have 1 billion -- [ 8 billion, 8.9 billion ] shares outstanding. obviously, through the issuance from the deal. So I'd like to get it back to 1.5 billion type range over the next 2 years. And we've got this capital. We don't -- there aren't enough things we can invest $10 billion, $15 billion in a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns we expect to generate. So it's a mix of all 3.

So sort of using a fourth quarter annualized is the right base to be thinking about. Just again, we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio. 
You're right. Our deposit costs were 24 basis points, which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw an improvement, as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits, obviously, at a lower rate, basically at 1 basis points relative to our wholesale that cost about 100 basis points. So part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding CDs and other wholesale funding with the off-balance sheet deposits that we're going to bring back on balance sheet. 
So we started the quarter, I think, about 65% of our funding in the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%. We would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off. That's obviously based on the maturities. So we continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with the incremental deposits."

So I'm very comfortable with these numbers. 
If we could achieve this, then obviously, the stocks would be trading much higher than it is today. And embedded in it, we do, do some math. We start with our budget. We start with our operating performance in 2018, '19, '20. We look at our budget projections. We do sensitivities around revenues. We understand what our comp and noncomp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration costs that have got to work through and then the synergies of the various businesses.

It's really a function, Glenn, of asset type. So for example, the wealthy of the clients, if you have clients with $100 million, they're not paying 58 basis points. They're probably paying, I don't know, closer to 10 basis points or something to a client with $1 million is being closer to 100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets. 
Obviously, some of the E*TRADE active trading clients have got higher velocity on them. They're going to have higher basis point numbers than a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort of peel away what's going on under the numbers. 
But to your broader question, do I see price compression across Wealth Management? No, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking and the banking lending and deposit product. 
On the asset management side, I mean, listen, if you're driving performance in the active side, you can generate -- you can hold your fees as they are. The underperformers lose their assets quick, and they lose their fees. So I'm not terribly bothered about it. 
And if you knew the names of the 3 above it, you probably guess them, there's a reason they're more index-oriented. It's a different business model. Now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of asset, but we pay a higher revenue comp structure per dollar invested. So it's not exactly a 30, 40, 50 basis point win, as you know, obviously."

So clearly, we don't expect to bring in all $8 trillion over time, but there's significant overlap, as you note, in these channels and in these wealth figures. 
We continue as you saw through the net new assets as James mentioned. A lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisers advise their clients. And we've seen people bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels. 
On the workplace, I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets and then over time, growing the relationships. Self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E*TRADE platform. As their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice, we're clearly going to capture that top part of the funnel with our FAs, with the FA-led model that we have. 
So again, a real opportunity, and I like the way you described it. Just look at the numbers, 2.5 million households, almost 5 million participants and 6.7 million households. The breadth and reach of the platform is quite large, and there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from. 
In terms of activity, as you can imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need. With the E*TRADE acquisition, we bring on incremental digital capabilities. 
And as you can imagine, this year, we're spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients. We're going to pilot around lead generation. We've defined the adviser group who's going to work with new clients, got scoring systems. We've got artificial intelligence, trying to help predict what people are going to want and need and best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made plus the digital from wealth. And we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward."

So it doesn't change our behavior at all. It's just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a minimum to achieve in this time period. And that's what we try and put in the 2-year period. But longer term, we are much more aggressive, but deal with reality of 2 years.

But we would expect continued growth, obviously, in that line. 
We had over 10% growth year-over-year in that asset management fees. And then on transactional, it's really going to be around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter, we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that, that was helped by the DCP number, which presumably may or may not repeat next year, but that's the margin on that revenue, as we've talked about in the past, is virtually 0. And so transactional generally has been declining. 
We now have the E*TRADE platform inside of Morgan Stanley. So the commissions based on there, options tradings as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number. So we'll be at a new level. But generally, that's going to be driven by volume-related activity. And we'll have to see how it plays out, recognizing the first 11 days have been pretty good."

And I fully appreciate we're competing with a historic day here so I particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk as we always try to be.  
Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4% while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E*TRADE, received an upgrade from Moody's to A2, were placed on review for upgrade a second time and announced our intent to acquire Eaton Vance. Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test result, we announced a $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point.  
Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first, let me walk you through our vision for the next decade and outlook focused on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now done since, I believe, 2012.  
Let's turn to Slide 3. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress and delivering strong results when markets are active. 2020 for sure tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs.  
We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014.  
Turn to Slide #4. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth with several strategic acquisitions. In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. And in 2020, we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. 
Combining with E*TRADE positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable, economic way. E*TRADE's technology, products and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E*TRADE serves a younger demographic who are on average over 10 years younger than those we've historically served and we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex.  
With Eaton Vance, we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution.  
Please turn to Slide #5. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing and stability, our firm is now at an inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all 3 of our business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share, expanding and deepening our client relationships realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage and finally, returning capital to our shareholders.  
Please turn to Slide 6. Scale in our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver, gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis. Our wealth and asset management platform is among the largest globally with over $5 trillion in combined assets. 
Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet as you can see on Slide 7. Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage and are capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020, international securities (sic) [ Institutional Securities ] generated over $300 million of revenues from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management in turn gained $20 billion of client assets, and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments, all from Institutional Securities referrals.  
Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities on Slide 8. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth, coupled with risk and expense discipline, was an operating margin of 35%.  
Turn to Slide 9, which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E*TRADE, we are now a top 3 player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances, and each presents unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households.  
If we look at E*TRADE on Slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records across all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled and net new assets more than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy E*TRADE was indeed the right one.  
On Slide 11, we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets this year new to our firm. That's 6% of beginning-period assets on a pro forma basis. We've invested heavily over the years building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology and building new businesses, and the addition of E*TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable. And while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, this is -- and this was likely at the high end of what is the likely range, we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels.  
On Slide 12, every year for the past decade, our revenues have increased. And with E*TRADE, our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That was compared to just 2% only 4 years ago.  
Let's talk about Investment Management on Slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion. And both MSIM and Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%.  
We're really excited about this transaction, and the integration planning is going well. Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong with increasing assets under management through the end of December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter.  
Slide 14 shows the power of our Wealth and Investment Management platforms when taken together. On a pro forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets are more than double the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly adviser-driven business model, revenue on these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand side of the page, is materially higher than our 3 larger competitors.  
Now let's turn to Slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side, with the additional liquidity and deposits we've added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals, and they are outlined in a little bit detail down the right-hand side of this slide.  
So turning to 16. Expense discipline is a fundamental tenet of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just 70% this past year. And obviously, that has driven the pretax profit expansion.  
So our fifth growth driver is highlighted on Page 17. Over the past several years, we've consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital. We're excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve.  
I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives, which are shown on Slide 18. While this year will be a transition year as we absorb 2 major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and frankly, our belief is that Wealth Management will generate a margin over 30% by 2022 we -- by 2022, and in that period, we expect to range from 26% to 30% as we continue to work through the E*TRADE integration.  
We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth, but we'll balance this with discipline. In so doing, we're keeping our long-term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69% to 72% over the next 2 years.  
Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also, of course, on capital distribution. In the meantime, we raised our 2-year target to the range of 14% to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now, we fully expect to achieve these as stated.  
That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to Jon who's going to go through the fourth quarter and annual results. Then, together, we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you."

Dynamic markets, incredible volatility and consistent",1657,"Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $48 billion in 2020, records both with and without E*TRADE. We saw continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets, incredible volatility and consistent client engagement across all 3 businesses drove results. Excluding E*TRADE integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58, respectively. 
We continued to deliver on operating leverage in 2020, led by Institutional Securities. Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 15% driven by increased volume-related expenses and higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the full year were up 16%, resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73%.  
Now to the businesses. In Institutional Securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year. Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter, marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced, and clients remained active up until the week of Christmas.  
Investment Banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full year, 26% higher than 2019, driven by record underwriting revenues, particularly in equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening of markets, beginning with debt and rescue financings, next with equity and very recently, leveraged loans and corporate M&A financing. Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade, generating revenues of $2.3 billion, 46% higher versus the prior year, driven by record underwriting and advisory results, with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates. 
Overall, the Investment Banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. The pace of M&A announcements has accelerated, and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in health care and technology and follow-on activity, notably in the Americas and Asia. After a record-breaking year in investment-grade and high-yield debt markets, strategic activity should support increased acquisition-related financing.  
In Equity sales and trading, we remain #1 globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full year revenues of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade. This year's market backdrop was unprecedented, and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity, elevated volatility and a double-digit increase in global market volumes. Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia.  
Fixed Income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade, increasing 59% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid/ask spreads. 
Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion increased 31% year-over-year. Results in the quarter and full year were led by credit and foreign exchange. For the full year, Asia showed particular strength. Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plan.  
Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter as we continue to support our clients while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline and is now close to pre-pandemic levels. 
After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first 3 quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4. ISG provisions were $14 million while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel.  
While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We derisked this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter, and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains stable, and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline.  
Turning to Wealth Management. On October 2, we closed our acquisition of E*TRADE. This quarter's results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E*TRADE revenues in transactional and NII. Making comparisons to prior periods are difficult so I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on Page 7 regarding the combined business.  
In the quarter, revenues were $5.7 billion. Excluding integration-related expenses of $231 million, the PBT margin was 22.9% and full year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong, reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity.  
We saw record fee-based flows of $77 billion for the year, and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth in 2020, and loans are nearly $100 billion. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and loans in forbearance are under $400 million, down from approximately $2 billion at the end of Q1.  
Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E*TRADE and are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter, and on a pro forma basis, over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisers and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisers. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future.  
In the quarter, Asset Management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated, and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both adviser-led and self-directed channels.  
Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with E*TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes the purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization, which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This year, NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates.  
On funding synergies, we onboarded approximately $4 billion of the deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4, and we expect to onboard approximately $20 billion in Q1. As we invest these deposits and shed higher-cost wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised higher funding benefits in NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions reflected in Q2. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII.  
Lastly, on rates, we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near term. However, we will benefit from the eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E*TRADE increases our U.S. bank's sensitivity to rates, and a 100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII compared to the estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition.  
We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over 3 years with approximately 40% to be realized this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured. 2021, we will be exiting the E*TRADE branches, consolidating our bank entities and integrating HR and finance systems and would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies during the year.  
Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, representing the second-highest quarterly level in over a decade. For the full year, revenues were $3.7 billion, in line with the prior period but reflecting a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest.  
Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion. The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net flows of $41 billion for the year and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%.  
We are excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance. Across businesses and strategies, Eaton Vance's assets under management across -- excuse me, increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong, and their momentum continues.  
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.1 trillion, and standardized RWAs increased to $454 billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E*TRADE. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 17.4%. 
Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full year, respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in and around 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility.  
We are pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipelines, engaged institutional and retail clients and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives.  
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

It seems as though the net new asset growth, the organic growth profile in the wealth business accelerated here in 2020. What do you think is driving that? Is that capturing a greater wallet share of existing clients? Is that an expansion of the client base? 
And it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions. Do you have an estimate of what that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate? Because I believe most of the other competitors disclose it net of those fees. So just want to try and make it like-for-like."

And as you pointed out, Brennan, it's the first time, I think, we've done it in many, many years. And we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth. I mean we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with, frankly, in absolute dollars, modest assets, and we're able to bring in $200 billion in a year.  
Now part of that is obviously the pro forma base. Part of that is if you look at what E*TRADE is doing, they're doing great. Part of it is if you're a net attrition of financial advisers, you will be a net attrition of assets on those advisers' books. For the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this, we're not in net attrition, which is interesting given the IFA channels continue to grow, but they're not growing from us.  
So we're keeping assets of our advisers. We're gaining assets from new advisers through the workplace initiatives, through Solium and E*TRADE. So we are gaining assets from the conversion and keeping of those assets at a higher rate than we were. So it's a whole variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm, and it's no single thing. 
I do think 6%, that's -- as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number, but it's a long way from the 2% or the 3%, 4% we're operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2%, and -- but maybe 6%, that feels high. Certainly, it's best in class to what The Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the disclosures."

You can figure -- see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure of about $10 billion or $11 billion. The fee-based flows do exclude that as a function about how much fee-based assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset bases. 
Hopefully, that clarifies the question. And I think for us, the net new assets, given the different business models across -- the different business models, that reflects most people don't have the level of asset-based fees that we do and we thought it was appropriate to disclose that."

So agreed there.  
And then for my follow-up, sort of a related question. One of the things that a lot of people and myself included think as one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the wealth business is the stock plan business, where you really just have a strong position competitively. And you flagged a lot of that in the deck, which is really helpful. You talked about the retention opportunity of the 15-plus percent, which is what E*TRADE has pointed to historically. 
Are you -- what's the plan to integrate the stock plan platforms? How long do you think that might take?  
And is it right -- when we think about the opportunity set, you've got the $435 billion of unvested assets. My guess is that's the opportunity set. About how much of that tends to vest per year? Is it about 1/4 or 30%? And it's right to think about that as evergreen, right? Like they vest and then they're replaced with new awards in subsequent year. Sorry about the multipart question, but I think it's important."

I would highlight that there were certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small companies, private companies, and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together.  
You're right, the existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets and roughly 5 million participants. Our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have and therefore, the number of participants. And we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the E*TRADE transaction. So we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel.  
And then lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vest each year. I think that's a pretax number. So clearly, there's tax impacting that. But as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships."

I mean just look at what we've been through in the last 12 months and look at activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter and then where the year finished. 
So clearly, there is a lot of activity in the market. There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Rates remain very low. I think the global economies are recovering. And I think the vaccine, if we get in the U.S. to 1 million doses a day for the next 150 days, would be spectacular. 
So there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance, new IPOs coming, recapitalizations of different kinds, raising debt. So there's a lot of market activity, I think, in the reasonable near term. Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds, less than 50%. I think -- but who knows? 
I mean the year has started off strong, and we count them one day at a time. And the year started off strong. The markets are active. The economies are recovering globally. New administration has come in. It looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So I'm quite optimistic about it. 
I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. Our Fixed Income franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Equities bounced and retained their #1 spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, with the banking revenues above $2 billion for the quarter, there's a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. 
So I'm pretty optimistic. I mean I can't put an exact number on it, but I certainly don't feel like we're going to make a major backstep at all here."

We have the capital to invest in our businesses. We're gaining share across our businesses. We've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency.

So as I think about it, I've described this before, half our company has that sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings. And we could clearly move the dividend higher and will once the regulators permit that. We have -- clearly, we have the capacity. 
On the book value, yes, I would actually have preferred to be buying stock last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that, but I'm not troubled by buying a little over book value. And I don't think we can be too cute. 
We have 1.8 billion, 1.9 billion shares outstanding, obviously, through the issuance from the deal. So I'd like to get it back to 1.5 billion type range over the next few years. And we've got this capital. We don't -- there aren't enough things we can invest $10 billion, $15 billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns we expect to generate.

So sort of using a fourth quarter annualized is the right base to be thinking about because, again, we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio. 
You're right, our deposit costs were 24 basis points, which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw an improvement -- as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits, obviously, at a lower rate, basically at 1 basis point, relative to our wholesale that cost about 100 basis points. So part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding CDs and other wholesale funding with the off-balance-sheet deposits that we're going to bring back on balance sheet. 
So we started the quarter, I think, about 65% of our funding in the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%. We would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off.

We're -- we believe we will deliver these numbers and for some of the reasons you list, rates being one of them. Obviously, it has a huge impact on this firm. 
But look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were. These obviously become very plausible. Whether it should be 17% plus, 18% plus, 19% plus -- listen, if we'd said to you 3 years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17%-plus ROTCE, you would have thought we're off the planet. So I'm very comfortable with these numbers. If we could achieve this, then, obviously, the stock would be trading much higher than it is today. 
And embedded in it, we do, do some math. We start with our budget. We start with our operating performance in 2018, '19, '20. We look at our budget projections. We do sensitivities around revenues. We understand what our comp and non-comp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration costs that we've got to work through and then the synergies of the various businesses. And then we, of course, look at the capital question, which I discussed earlier, I think, with Christian on buyback, dividend or reinvestment in the business and what our RWA growth is going to be in ISG and how that affects the CET1. And you put all of that in a big washing machine and now it's a number with a plus on it."

It's really a function, Glenn, of asset type. So for example, the wealthier the client -- if you have clients with $100 million, they're not paying 58 basis points. They're probably paying, I don't know, closer to 10 basis points or something. A client with $1 million is paying closer to 100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets.  
Obviously, some of the E*TRADE active trading clients have got higher velocity on them. They're going to have higher basis point numbers than a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort of peel away what's going on under the numbers. 
But to your broader question, do I see price compression across Wealth Management? No, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking and the banking, lending and deposit product. 
On the asset management side, I mean, listen, if you're driving performance in the active side, you can generate -- you can hold your fees as they are. The underperformers lose their assets quick and they lose their fees. So I'm not terribly bothered about it. 
And if you knew the names of the 3 above it, you probably guessed them, there's a reason. They're more index-oriented. It's a different business model. Now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of asset but we pay a higher revenue comp structure per dollar of asset. So it's not exactly a 30, 40, 50 basis point win, as you know, obviously."

We paid a onetime bonus to all employees earning less than, I think, $150,000 who don't receive bonuses. Given the head count in Wealth Management, that disproportionately affects that business. 
So there's always a few things going on, but 1 point of margin is worth about $45 million a quarter, I think, if I'm doing my maths right, $18 billion, $180 million, so something like that. So it's not -- small numbers can move it around 1 point or 2, but I think with increased growth, increased efficiency, better conversion of the assets, more asset flows and generating this average 58 basis points is how you bounce between the sort of 20 -- what did we say, 24% to 30% range."

So clearly, we don't expect to bring in all $8 trillion over time, but there's significant overlap, as you note, in these channels and in these wealth figures. 
We continue -- as you saw through the net new assets, as James mentioned, a lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisers advise their clients. And we've seen people bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels. 
On the workplace, I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets and then over time, growing the relationships. Self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E*TRADE platform as their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice. We're clearly going to capture that top part of the funnel with our FAs, with the FA-led model that we have. 
So again, a real opportunity. And I like the way you described it. Just look at the numbers, 2.5 million households -- almost 5 million participants, 6.7 million households. The breadth and reach of the platform is quite large. And there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from. 
In terms of trade activity, as you can imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need. With the E*TRADE acquisition, we bring on incremental digital capabilities. And as you can imagine, this year, we're spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients. We're going to pilot around lead generation. 
We've defined the adviser group who's going to work with new clients, got scoring systems. We've got artificial intelligence trying to help predict what people are going to want and need and next best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made plus the digital from wealth. And we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward."

And then on transactional, it's really going to be around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter, we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that, that was helped by the DCP number, which presumably may or may not repeat next year. But the margin on that revenue, as we've talked about in the past, is virtually 0. 
And so transactional generally has been declining. We now have the E*TRADE platform inside of Morgan Stanley. So the commission's based on there. Options tradings as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number so we'll be at a new level. But generally, that's going to be driven by volume-related activity.

The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs, numerous performance records, the closing of the Eat",715,"Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs, numerous performance records, the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year and 1 very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund at [indiscernible]. In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%.
Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best-ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represent an annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pretax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years and we expect will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE and particularly the strength of the self-directed not has exceeded our expectations.
In addition, assets continue to migrate towards the base. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans. And as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to $5.1 million. Institutional Securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment Banking revenues reached a record driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade.
Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together 2 high-performing asset managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum that Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion and pro forma net flows grew approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%.
Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination and increasingly recognize a highly differentiated value, offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments.
Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of our CAGRs. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions which are not especially problematic that might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible and in so doing, incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation.
Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations and as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing Wealth and Investment Management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the fast firm this quarter. We are more than convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead.
I'll now turn it over to John to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions."

The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4% and our efficiency ratio was 66%.
First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and 3 years restated data on Pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. The more significant items are as follows: for the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses; in Institutional Securities, Sales and Trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses and other revenues notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges as well as the impact of deferred compensation plan; and in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into 2 lines. Asset management has been renamed asset management and related fees, although the historical numbers remain the same, and we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named performance-based income and other, notably carried interest.
We have also updated our AUM disclosures. Alternatives and other has been updated to alternatives and solutions to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called liquidity and overlay services.
Now to the businesses. The momentum in institutional securities witnessed through the back half of 2020 continued as clients remained highly engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex.
Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the 4 best quarters of the last decade in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues $2 billion, more than doubling the prior year driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflected strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong with blocks, follow-ons and convertibles also notable.
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $631 million were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year as companies continue to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across noninvestment-grade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active, equity markets should support issuance and conditions remain favorable for borrowers, and we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and health care.
Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in a decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and prime brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher prime brokerage balances, respectively, were offset by the losses James discussed.
Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad-based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus and the movement and passive rates supported client activity.
Micro performance continues to be strong. The meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust, though reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid as spreads were more stable this period and commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $123 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans and related hedges.
Turning to ISG lending. Our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and paydowns on corporate relationship loans, particularly noninvestment grade, resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million, and our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion, while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans and lending commitments. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment-grade clients that were largely offset by paydowns. Approximately 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment-grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million.
Turning to Wealth Management. Given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter, revenue increased 11%. Integration-related expenses were $64 million, and excluding these costs, pretax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.9%.
The underlying growth drivers in this business remain extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion, driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion, and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisers also recognize the value of our platform, demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention which also benefited NNA. Elevated client activity across both advisor-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high, putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust, reflecting record net buying activity.
Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of 1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of 1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E*TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin.
Asset management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially, benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior 6 years, and revenues are up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust, with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities-based lending at the quarterly balance sheet growth of $7 billion, north of the 10% full year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth.
Net interest income was $1.4 billion, including prepayment amortization which turned positive and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6% and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, growth in bank lending balances and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to run off additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending.
We're even more excited about E*TRADE today than when we announced the deal as momentum on the E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NNA. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress with our integration. The rest of 2021, we'll be focused on analyzing the comprehensive data sets which cover adviser-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisers to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey.
Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity planned wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley At Work platform. A number of participants now stands at 5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have 1, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows.
On the expense side, we are on track to realize $100 million of cost synergies in 2021 and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year.
Moving to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio was impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include 1 month of the comp buying businesses financial, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We are pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcement to close, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM.
The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and regions. We saw a particular strength in MSIM global equity strategies which continued to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and Parametric is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance's leading floating rate loan business recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw a strong growth as ESG investing accelerates.
In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningfully increased, and asset management-related fees were $1.1 billion with just 1 month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which integration-related expenses were negligible.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter to 16.8%. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%
We are pleased with our results in the first quarter as our 3 world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring and less capital-intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services with our enlarged customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops.
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

So I'm curious, I know we've been seeing these trends accelerate from Morgan Stanley for over a year now, but how much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to E*TRADE versus full-service wealth management at Morgan Stanley?

I mean, historically, the growth rate, as you probably know, in the full service, as you call it, wirehouses, it's been, I don't know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years with loss of financial advisers, some loss of assets into the RIA channel and clearly lost to some of the direct distributors and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute, but this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that wealth management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel, we have that through E*TRADE; number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E*TRADE; number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are bringing in assets and we're doing that; and number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas, which linked to our institutional business and the quality research and products, you're just operating at a different level. And so I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things. E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which, again, we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%.
Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors, tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualized 10% a year for the next several years, that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and I got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, it's just that It's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there."

The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits, which, as you know, was feathered in over the quarter, and so that will have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So we feel good about the guidance we gave you. The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the wealth management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels."

We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job a level below where we are now, so I'd say the accumulated both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy. We quarterize bad stuff and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office actually. No outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in the single stock position, very concentrated single stock long positions that had explosive growth, and they're offset by the various shorts in the indices that they were short. So it was -- and I think what the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings steep, but it's not going to change how we feel about the prime brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So it doesn't change that at all, but I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office type relationships where they're very concentrated and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. Better information is always good in routing out where potential problems can be. So obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it, but we -- as I said, we're never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter end. We didn't want this thing to be lingering."

So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move, so there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates.

So I still want to get to what was so complex about this one? Is it really just the family office nature and the less disclosure on the multiple primes and the levers you deployed? Were you -- because obviously, what's been great about your PB business is -- I mean, you didn't even lose money in '08, you have the assets when they -- historically, when you have the assets and things break, you look for more collateral for you blow out the positions, what was different about this one? And what do you think -- why wasn't it disclosed? Why didn't this meet the materiality test? And then what do you think regulators want to change going forward? Sorry for the follow-ups."

And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter, and so I don't want to spend too much talking about a specific client situation which is not done in history. But let me touch on a couple of things, going sort of reverse. Sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. The business ISG was having a record quarter. The equities business where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've got to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter, and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's -- frankly, given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of, I don't know, 340 quarters that we've had since our origination. So we've got to sort of focus on the big picture on that one. What was different about the situate relative to '08, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had -- we went back through the records, and I don't think we've ever had ever a long time, but a loss in the PB business. And the business is, back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now, and we're the #1 prime broker in the world. We were the #1 prime broker in this particular instance.
There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers. And as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them and I'm not the expert on it, made it more difficult to understand exactly who is holding what where. And that's something that we'll work through, and that's part of out of the learning experience. It was complicated, I will say, last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stop positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriter, and we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting which happened on that Friday. So we had to hold off which caused us to be later than some, if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on, we just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So anyway, it's a long story. But again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary."

So we've seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline as we bring in FAs, and they are successful and they like the platform. They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues and therefore, it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's point number one.
In terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made. Net recruiting aided in the NNA. The E*TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel, bringing in existing clients away, so just broad-based activity very, very active. We talked about client engagement being quite spectacular this quarter, and it really aided those numbers, but broad-based."

So I think client engagement is very, very strong at 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average trade in the fourth quarter which was a record. It was less than $1 million over the course of last year. So we're clearly at elevated levels. So I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in '19, no. But can we sustain this level, no one's got a crystal ball, but right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged, and we'll have to see how this plays out over time."

And why do you think it was that you were the only large bank to call out losses of this magnitude when others didn't?

We are confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year in terms of our strategic goals.

We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FA to the client based on specific needs.

I can't tell you how excited me about the combination of these 4 businesses. The Eaton Vance, our own investment management business, our traditional core wealth management business and E*TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. I mean look at the Parametric product in Eaton Avance, it's extraordinary, they've done an unbelievable job, our Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with Solium there and now will be 1 of the top 2 workplace providers in the world. Things that we can do to expand internationally, taking Eaton Vance's product using our international distribution, putting some of our core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. So it's just -- there are so many verticals now which are driving growth. And once upon a time, when we had the core business, it's sort of number of financial advisers and productivity per financial adviser. That's basically the only 2 metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are moving along.
So sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally, they hate that. But you know what, I told Danny Simkowitz a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform was a $1 trillion assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset, it's not assets. And I said, ""Yes, I know it, but I'd like $1 trillion worth high revenues per asset."" And guess what, we've got a $1.4 trillion. When we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had $500 billion under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to $10 trillion. We've got all these growth verticals, and I just couldn't be more excited about it."

As you said, credit has historically been a strong point for us, but we're seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space. And so again, we think we've gained market share since we've restructured this business. We were probably a 6% or 7% player before. We're now probably at 10%, maybe even 10% plus player. We would expect to maintain that market share going forward, potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more, but we've been very pleased with the balance of the business and the results over the last several years in this business."

Number one, your comment about margin and collateral, I mean I think the way that we think about it is we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true. And James has mentioned, It wasn't necessarily -- it was a family office, it wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us. So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies, and we'll continue to be diligent around all of those points."

And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very active, very strong, and we've been a market leader in that space. To appropriate, we point out that the backlog, I think, is over 200 SPACs on file, so I would expect that we'll continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a pause as the market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it, so I don't want to get in front of that. But there is clearly interest in this product, both from an issuer and a buyer perspective, and I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A products. But I'd also point out, there's a couple of hundred million dollars of sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment, but there's also $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So if you put multiples or leverage on those, there's a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward."

The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses.

The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs, numerous performance records, the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year, and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund, Archegos. 
In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business, and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. 
Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best-ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represent an annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pretax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years and we expect it will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE and particularly the strength of the self-directed channel has exceeded our expectations. 
In addition, assets continue to migrate towards [ advise ]. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans. And as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1 million. 
Institutional Securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment Banking revenues reached a record driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade. 
Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together 2 high-performing asset managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion and pro forma net flows grew approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%. 
Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination and increasingly recognize a highly differentiated value, offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments. 
Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions which are not especially problematic that might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible and in so doing, incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation. 
Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations and as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing Wealth and Investment Management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which, approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the fast firm this quarter. We are more than convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions."

The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4% and our efficiency ratio was 66%. 
First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and 3 years restated data on Pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. 
The more significant items are as follows: for the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses; in Institutional Securities, Sales & Trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses, and other revenues notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges as well as the impact of deferred compensation plan; and in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into 2 lines. Asset management has been renamed asset management and related fees, although the historical numbers remain the same, and we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named performance-based income and other, notably carried interest. 
We have also updated our AUM disclosures. Alternatives and other has been updated to alternatives and solutions to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio of services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called liquidity and overlay services. 
Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back half of 2020 continued as clients remained highly engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex. 
Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the 4 best quarters of the last decade in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflected its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong with blocks, follow-ons and convertibles also notable. 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $631 million were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year as companies continued to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across noninvestment-grade financings spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active, equity markets should support issuance and conditions remain favorable for borrowers, and we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and health care. 
Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in a decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and prime brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher prime brokerage balances, respectively, were offset by the losses James discussed. 
Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad-based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus and the movement and passive rates supported client activity. 
Micro performance continues to be strong. The meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust, though reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid/ask spreads were more stable this period and commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $123 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans and related hedges. 
Turning to ISG lending. Our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and paydowns on corporate relationship loans, particularly noninvestment grade, resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million, and our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion, while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. 
Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans and lending commitments. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment-grade clients that were largely offset by paydowns. Approximately 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment-grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million. 
Turning to Wealth Management. Given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter, revenue increased 11%. Integration-related expenses were $64 million, and excluding these costs, pretax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.9%. 
The underlying growth drivers in this business remain extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion, driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion, and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisers also recognized the value of our platform, demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention, which also benefited NNA. Elevated client activity across both adviser-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high, putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust, reflecting record net buying activity. 
Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of 1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of 1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E*TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin. 
Asset Management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially, benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior 6 years, and revenues are up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust, with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities-based lending had a quarterly balance sheet growth of $7 billion, north of the 10% full year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth. 
Net interest income was $1.4 billion, including prepayment amortization, which turned positive and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6% and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, growth in bank lending balances and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to run off additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending. 
We're even more excited about E*TRADE today than when we announced the deal as momentum on the E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NNA. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. 
We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress with our integration. The rest of 2021 will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive data sets which cover adviser-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisers to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey. 
Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity planned wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley at Work platform. Our number of participants now stands at 5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have one, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows. 
On the expense side, we are on track to realize $100 million of cost synergies in 2021 and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year. 
Moving to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which, half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio was impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include 1 month of the comp buying businesses financials, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We are pleased that the businesses retained their strong momentum from announcement to close, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. 
The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and regions. We saw a particular strength in MSIM global equity strategies which continued to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric-customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and Parametric is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance's leading floating rate loan business recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw a strong growth as ESG investing accelerates. 
In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningfully increased, and asset management-related fees were $1.1 billion with just 1 month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which, integration-related expenses were negligible. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter to 16.8%. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%.
We are pleased with our results in the first quarter as our 3 world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring and less capital-intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services with our enlarged customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops. 
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

It's not something that's narrative around wirehouses failing to be able to grow really jives with. So I'm curious, I know we've been seeing these trends accelerate from Morgan Stanley for over a year now, but how much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to E*TRADE versus full-service Wealth Management at Morgan Stanley?

I mean, historically, the growth rate, as you probably know, in the full service, as you call it, wirehouses, it's been, I don't know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years with loss of financial advisers, some loss of assets into the RIA channel and clearly lost to some of the direct distributors and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. 
And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute, but this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel, we have that through E*TRADE; number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E*TRADE; number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are bringing in assets and we're doing that; and number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas, which linked to our institutional business and the quality research and products; you're just operating at a different level. 
And so I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things. E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which, again, we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%.
Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors, tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualized 10% a year for the next several years, that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and I got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, is just a -- it's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there."

I think as I said in the first quarter, we don't expect any movement in policy rates. The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth, we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits, which, as you know, was feathered in over the quarter. And so that will have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So we feel good about the guidance we gave you. 
The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the Wealth Management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels."

I think -- I mean, my comment about the way the -- this team has worked together now for a decade. We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job a level below where we are now, so I'd say the accumulated both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy. We cauterize bad stuff and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. 
This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office, actually. No outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in the single stock position, very concentrated single stock long positions that had explosive growth, and they're offset by the various shorts, in the indices that they were short. So it was -- and I think what the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. 
But it's not going to change how we feel about the prime brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So it doesn't change that at all, but I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type relationships where they're very concentrated and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. 
Better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be. So obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it, but we -- as I said, we're never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter end. We didn't want this thing to be lingering."

It will clearly continue to tick down over the course of the quarter, assuming rates, short-term rates don't move. And again, we're not expecting policy rates to move as the wholesale, higher-cost wholesale deposits roll off. 
I think as you recall, when we originally announced the transaction, I think we've talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the growth in deposits. We said that we would realize that in -- $200 billion of which will be realized this year, so we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022. So all of the sort of the movement, if you will, and the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our synergy -- funding synergy calculations. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move, so there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates. And NII will grow because the quantum will grow based on loan growth and then we'd pick up the funding synergy."

And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter, and so I don't want to spend too much talking about a specific client situation which is now done and history. 
But let me touch on a couple of things, going sort of reverse. Sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. The business ISG was having a record quarter. The equities business where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've got to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter, and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's -- frankly, given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of, I don't know, 340 quarters that we've had it since our origination. So we've got to sort of focus on the big picture on that one. 
What was different about this situation relative to '08, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had -- we went back through the records, and I don't think we've ever had -- ever is a long time, but a loss in the PB business. And the business is, back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now, and we're the #1 prime broker in the world. We were the #1 prime broker in this particular instance.
There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers. And as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them and I'm not the expert on it, made it more difficult to understand exactly who is holding what where. And that's something that we'll work through, and that's part of out of the learning experience. 
It was complicated, I will say, last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriter, and we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting which happened on that Friday. So we had to hold off, which caused us to be later than some, if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on. We just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So anyway, it's a long story. But again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary."

They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues and therefore, it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting.

In terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made. Net recruiting aided in the NNA.

And again, without the crystal ball, I'll just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw in the first quarter, and then we collectively get to -- and decide whether we think that will persist for what period of time. 
We clearly still have strong asset values. I mentioned we have healthy pipelines, and clients are significantly engaged, both retail and institutional. Markets are open. There's lots of liquidity. And we are seeing a continuation of the accelerating economic data around the globe, obviously, news coming out of China this morning or last night in terms of the growth recovery. So really good backdrop or macro backdrop. As James mentioned, seasonality, the first quarter is usually the strongest. Typically, it wasn't last year, but typically, it is the strongest in these businesses. 
We are confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year in terms of our strategic goals. We do believe, and I think the data supports, that we're gaining market share across all of our businesses, so that's something that we would expect to persist. And I think this year is really going to be focused on that, just growing our market shares and integrating these two very important acquisitions."

I mean I think what we've said all along, we're going to be very deliberate with the integrations. These deals were not about costs, they were about growth, and we do not want to disrupt the client experience. We obviously want to enhance it over time, so we are being very deliberate. We're investing in the platforms. We're investing in the service model. And we are in the process, as we've mentioned before, of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand what we need so we can service our clients better. 
So for example, we're defining -- running pilots around lead generation. We're defining the FAs that will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FA to the client based on specific needs. And the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes, the people and the process to be able to support our clients in the coming years. So we think there's huge potential. 
James mentioned the 5 million workplace participants where only clients outside of that channel, with about half of those, that business continues to grow. The great thing about that business is that it's scalable. Think of it as a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships. That experience is digital, so it is very, very scalable, and we would expect real growth not only in that channel, but to drive growth across the platform really out of the workplace."

I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these 4 businesses. The Eaton Vance, our own Investment Management business, our traditional core Wealth Management business and E*TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. 
I mean look at the Parametric product in Eaton Vance, it's extraordinary, they've done an unbelievable job. Our Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with Solium there and now we'll be 1 of the top 2 workplace providers in the world. Things that we can do to expand internationally, taking Eaton Vance's product using our international distribution, putting some of our core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. 
So it's just -- there are so many verticals now which are driving growth. And once upon a time, when we had the core business, it's sort of number of financial advisers and productivity per financial adviser. That's basically the only 2 metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are bopping along.
So sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally, they hate that. But you know what, I told Danny Simkowitz a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform, was a $1 trillion assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset, it's not assets. And I said, ""Yes, I know it, but I'd like $1 trillion worth high revenues per asset."" And guess what, we've got a $1.4 trillion. When we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had $500 billion under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to $10 trillion. We've got all these growth verticals, and I just couldn't be more excited about it."

And when we first convert them, we're reasonably indifferent whether they go into the self-directed channel, the FA channel, a virtual channel, because that will just give us an opportunity to build that relationship, deepen that relationship. As the clients' requirements and services and needs change, we'll be able to grow with them. 
And so your comment about migrating one across a wealth client across the different platforms will be the ultimate goal.

And James has mentioned, It wasn't necessarily -- it was a family office, it wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us.

There seems to be a pause as the market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it, so I don't want to get in front of that. 
But there is clearly interest in this product, both from an issuer and a buyer perspective, and I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A products. But I'd also point out, there's a couple of hundred million dollars of sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment, but there's also $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So if you put multiples or leverage on those, there's a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward."

The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs, numerous performance records, the closing of the E",714,"Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs, numerous performance records, the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year, and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund, Archegos. 
In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business, and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. 
Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best-ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represent an annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pretax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years and we expect it will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE and particularly the strength of the self-directed channel has exceeded our expectations. 
In addition, assets continue to migrate towards [ advise ]. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans. And as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1 million. 
Institutional Securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment Banking revenues reached a record driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade. 
Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together 2 high-performing asset managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion and pro forma net flows grew approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%. 
Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination and increasingly recognize a highly differentiated value, offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments. 
Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions which are not especially problematic that might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible and in so doing, incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation. 
Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations and as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing Wealth and Investment Management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which, approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the fast firm this quarter. We are more than convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions."

The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4% and our efficiency ratio was 66%. 
First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and 3 years restated data on Pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. 
The more significant items are as follows: for the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses; in Institutional Securities, Sales & Trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses, and other revenues notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges as well as the impact of deferred compensation plan; and in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into 2 lines. Asset management has been renamed asset management and related fees, although the historical numbers remain the same, and we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named performance-based income and other, notably carried interest. 
We have also updated our AUM disclosures. Alternatives and other has been updated to alternatives and solutions to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio of services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called liquidity and overlay services. 
Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back half of 2020 continued as clients remained highly engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex. 
Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the 4 best quarters of the last decade in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflected its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong with blocks, follow-ons and convertibles also notable. 
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $631 million were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year as companies continued to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across noninvestment-grade financings spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active, equity markets should support issuance and conditions remain favorable for borrowers, and we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and health care. 
Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in a decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and prime brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher prime brokerage balances, respectively, were offset by the losses James discussed. 
Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad-based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus and the movement and passive rates supported client activity. 
Micro performance continues to be strong. The meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust, though reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid/ask spreads were more stable this period and commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $123 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans and related hedges. 
Turning to ISG lending. Our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and paydowns on corporate relationship loans, particularly noninvestment grade, resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million, and our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion, while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. 
Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans and lending commitments. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment-grade clients that were largely offset by paydowns. Approximately 90% of this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment-grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million. 
Turning to Wealth Management. Given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter, revenue increased 11%. Integration-related expenses were $64 million, and excluding these costs, pretax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.9%. 
The underlying growth drivers in this business remain extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion, driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion, and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisers also recognized the value of our platform, demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention, which also benefited NNA. Elevated client activity across both adviser-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high, putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust, reflecting record net buying activity. 
Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of 1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of 1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E*TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin. 
Asset Management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially, benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior 6 years, and revenues are up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust, with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities-based lending had a quarterly balance sheet growth of $7 billion, north of the 10% full year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth. 
Net interest income was $1.4 billion, including prepayment amortization, which turned positive and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6% and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, growth in bank lending balances and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to run off additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending. 
We're even more excited about E*TRADE today than when we announced the deal as momentum on the E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NNA. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. 
We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress with our integration. The rest of 2021 will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive data sets which cover adviser-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisers to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey. 
Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity planned wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley at Work platform. Our number of participants now stands at 5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have one, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows. 
On the expense side, we are on track to realize $100 million of cost synergies in 2021 and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year. 
Moving to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which, half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio was impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include 1 month of the comp buying businesses financials, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We are pleased that the businesses retained their strong momentum from announcement to close, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. 
The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and regions. We saw a particular strength in MSIM global equity strategies which continued to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric-customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and Parametric is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance's leading floating rate loan business recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw a strong growth as ESG investing accelerates. 
In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningfully increased, and asset management-related fees were $1.1 billion with just 1 month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which, integration-related expenses were negligible. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter to 16.8%. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%.
We are pleased with our results in the first quarter as our 3 world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring and less capital-intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services with our enlarged customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops. 
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

I mean, historically, the growth rate, as you probably know, in the full service, as you call it, wirehouses, it's been, I don't know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years with loss of financial advisers, some loss of assets into the RIA channel and clearly lost to some of the direct distributors and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. 
And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute, but this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel, we have that through E*TRADE; number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E*TRADE; number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are bringing in assets and we're doing that; and number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas, which linked to our institutional business and the quality research and products; you're just operating at a different level. 
And so I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things. E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which, again, we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%.
Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors, tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualized 10% a year for the next several years, that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and I got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, is just a -- it's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there."

And so that will have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So we feel good about the guidance we gave you. 
The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the Wealth Management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels."

We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job a level below where we are now, so I'd say the accumulated both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy. We cauterize bad stuff and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. 
This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office, actually. No outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in the single stock position, very concentrated single stock long positions that had explosive growth, and they're offset by the various shorts, in the indices that they were short. So it was -- and I think what the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. 
But it's not going to change how we feel about the prime brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So it doesn't change that at all, but I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type relationships where they're very concentrated and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. 
Better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be. So obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it, but we -- as I said, we're never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter end. We didn't want this thing to be lingering."

I think as you recall, when we originally announced the transaction, I think we've talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the growth in deposits. We said that we would realize that in -- $200 billion of which will be realized this year, so we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022. So all of the sort of the movement, if you will, and the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our synergy -- funding synergy calculations. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move, so there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates.

And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter, and so I don't want to spend too much talking about a specific client situation which is now done and history. 
But let me touch on a couple of things, going sort of reverse. Sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. The business ISG was having a record quarter. The equities business where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've got to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter, and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's -- frankly, given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of, I don't know, 340 quarters that we've had it since our origination. So we've got to sort of focus on the big picture on that one. 
What was different about this situation relative to '08, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had -- we went back through the records, and I don't think we've ever had -- ever is a long time, but a loss in the PB business. And the business is, back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now, and we're the #1 prime broker in the world. We were the #1 prime broker in this particular instance.
There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers. And as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them and I'm not the expert on it, made it more difficult to understand exactly who is holding what where. And that's something that we'll work through, and that's part of out of the learning experience. 
It was complicated, I will say, last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriter, and we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting which happened on that Friday. So we had to hold off, which caused us to be later than some, if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on. We just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So anyway, it's a long story. But again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary."

So we've seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline as we bring in FAs, and they are successful and they like the platform. They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues and therefore, it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's point number one.
In terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made. Net recruiting aided in the NNA. The E*TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel, bringing in existing clients away, so just broad-based activity very, very active.

So I think client engagement is very, very strong at 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average trade in the fourth quarter, which was a record. It was less than 1 million over the course of last year. 
So we're clearly at elevated levels. Do I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in '19? No. But can we sustain this level, no one's got a crystal ball, but right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged, and we'll have to see how this plays out over time."

We're investing in the platforms. We're investing in the service model.

So for example, we're defining -- running pilots around lead generation. We're defining the FAs that will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FA to the client based on specific needs.

I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these 4 businesses. The Eaton Vance, our own Investment Management business, our traditional core Wealth Management business and E*TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. 
I mean look at the Parametric product in Eaton Vance, it's extraordinary, they've done an unbelievable job. Our Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with Solium there and now we'll be 1 of the top 2 workplace providers in the world. Things that we can do to expand internationally, taking Eaton Vance's product using our international distribution, putting some of our core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. 
So it's just -- there are so many verticals now which are driving growth. And once upon a time, when we had the core business, it's sort of number of financial advisers and productivity per financial adviser. That's basically the only 2 metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are bopping along.
So sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally, they hate that. But you know what, I told Danny Simkowitz a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform, was a $1 trillion assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset, it's not assets. And I said, ""Yes, I know it, but I'd like $1 trillion worth high revenues per asset."" And guess what, we've got a $1.4 trillion. When we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had $500 billion under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to $10 trillion. We've got all these growth verticals, and I just couldn't be more excited about it."

First is we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios. As James mentioned, we're looking at our stress testing methodology, and we will recalibrate it if and where it's appropriate to do so, number one. Your comment about margin and collateral, I mean, I think the way that we think about it is we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true. And James has mentioned, It wasn't necessarily -- it was a family office, it wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us. 
So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies, and we'll continue to be diligent around all of those points."

I mean, listen, the SPAC or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or a direct listing. And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very active, very strong, and we've been a market leader in that space. Do appropriately point out that the backlog, I think, is over 200 SPACs on file, so I would expect that we'll continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a pause as the market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it, so I don't want to get in front of that. 
But there is clearly interest in this product, both from an issuer and a buyer perspective, and I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A products. But I'd also point out, there's a couple of hundred million dollars of sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment, but there's also $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So if you put multiples or leverage on those, there's a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward."

The other point I would make is, in terms of the workplace retention, when we announced the transaction, we targeted a 15% retention rate there. It's early days, but we're pleased with the progress that we're making. E*TRADE is still -- the E*TRADE platform retention rate is still well above 15%, so we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that.

The firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first half with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management. And in the first 6",554,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first half with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management. And in the first 6 months of the year, we added over $250 billion of net new assets across both of those businesses. 
We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management. And in Investment Management, our asset mix is increasingly diverse and well positioned in key secular growth areas such as customization, private alternatives and sustainability. 
Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance. Equity remains the preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains, and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly. 
Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our integrations. Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but much more importantly, we're seeing long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement. 
This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and year-to-date were over 20%. Obviously, we're exceeding our longer-term targets of 17% plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-year, I want to assure you we are as focused on delivering top performance as ever. Though we're always subject to the broader macro environment, we will strive for continued outperformance. 
Now let me talk about the decision we announced 2 weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to 0 and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share. Over the past decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grow our dividend from $0.05 ultimately to $0.35 and increased our buyback from $0 to $5 billion. 
I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment Management contribute durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what we are doing. As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share and also increased our buyback for up to $12 billion over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and our performance over the past 3 Federal Reserve stress tests. 
These tests confirmed what we have said for many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital. And we have the ability to invest in our business, do acquisitions, maintain a very healthy dividend yield and increase our buyback. Given our current earnings momentum, it may take some time to fully distribute our capital, but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start. 
Now Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us. And as you know, Jon took on additional responsibilities as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1. 
So let me turn it over to Sharon, who will discuss the quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you."

The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses. 
Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89. Our ROTCE was 19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our firm, which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisition. Investing for growth remains a priority, while also managing our expense base. 
On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion, and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion. The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our firm efficiency ratio declined to 67% excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business. 
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues in Investment Banking and Equities were offset by lower Fixed Income results. Underwriting was particularly robust as issuance remained elevated. And despite lower volatility across asset classes, our Sales & Trading clients remained engaged. 
We ended the period on a strong footing as clients were active through June. Investment Banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting. 
From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the strongest in over a decade. And while technology and health care remain areas of core strength, activity in financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate and other sectors supported higher revenues. 
Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continue to look for strategic opportunities as markets remain open and constructive. 
Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest on record and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion. The increase from the prior year was driven by traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally. 
Fixed Income underwriting revenues of $640 million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth. 
Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are #1 in this business globally. Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased interest in the region from both Asia and non-Asia-based clients. 
Cash and derivative results were robust but declined versus the prior year against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased versus last year as average balances reached new highs. 
Fixed Income revenues were $1.7 billion. Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products. This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust compared to historical averages but declined from the prior year as credit markets were relatively range-bound and bid offer spreads compressed. Macro also declined versus last year with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange on the back of lower volatility. 
Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans, net of related hedges. Prior year results benefited from significant credit spread tightening. 
Turning to ISG lending. Our allowance for loan -- for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million, and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily related to one facility. 
Total ISG loans were flat. The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion relative to the prior quarter. 
Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year, given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion. Excluding integration-related costs of $60 million, PBT was also a record of $1.7 billion with a margin of 27.8%. 
Growth drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to $176 billion of -- which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half. Net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results. 
Further, we continue to see strength in net recruiting and retention, also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business. 
Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained high. 
Self-directed daily average trades were 1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above-average levels for full year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-directed channel. 
Asset management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion, bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the amount for the full year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now $1.7 trillion or more than double the level of only 5 years ago. 
Bank lending balances grew by a record [ 10 million ], and balances reached 115 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full year expectation of 10%. This was driven by strong demand for securities-based lending. 
Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly. The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve. 
We have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021. For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels. 
The integration of E*TRADE is going well, and we continue to prioritize client experience. While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals. 
The workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are also gaining traction. We had 4x as many wins year-over-year. 
Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis. 
Revenues were $1.7 billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion, and total [ net flows ] were over $48 billion. Since we announced the acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increased diversification of this business was a significant driver of results. 
Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter and stands at a record high of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion. The benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter. 
Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw particular strength in alternatives and solutions driven primarily by demand for Parametric customized portfolios as well as a $1 billion strategic multi-asset partnership mandate. We continue to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms. Loan strategies and fixed income were particularly robust. 
Asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year driven by strong AUM growth and the addition of Eaton Vance. Performance-based income and other revenues were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio. With the integration on pace, our very strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income and high conviction equity investing positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Spot assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to $461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET 1 requirement, including the SCB, of 13.2%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock or 34 million shares. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%. 
The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, we are starting the third quarter from a position of strength. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy. Dialogues are active and markets are open. 
Wealth Management continues to retain and attract new clients, new advisers and new assets. Investment Management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform. 
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

So I'll come back to that. 
In the institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market leader in that. We will pick up share over time. 
Clearly, in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot of the middle market M&A space is very fertile. There are different parts of the world we still think we can punch above our weight. So I actually think both of those, the equities business as good as it is and M&A as good as it is. I actually think there's real upside in both of those. 
In the Fixed Income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1 billion a quarter. We raised it to $1.5 billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter of $1.7 billion. As rates normalize and as the Fixed Income fee pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of space there. 
In the SPG credit side, we've got a world-class business there, again, continuing to grow share. And our commodities business is doing very well. So the IC franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to this quarter was 7, was a little -- it was, frankly, better than we had expected coming into it, which is terrific. 
But it's very interesting. I mean the share gains across -- and it's not just us, some of the other big players in the U.S. are real and I think enduring. And as the global economies recover and the fee pool increases, you'll just see more of that. So I feel very confident about the ISG business."

I think every now and then in business, you look and you sort of see a wave coming, and you catch the wave. And it's a beautiful thing. The whole workplace space to me is the next major growth area in financial services. 
I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at that Solium transaction, which, at the time, some people thought was expensive and it was. I think we spent 800 or 900 on it, might have been Canadian dollars. So somewhere around there, and it was trading at about 500 value. 
That gave us the opportunity to do the E*TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients ultimately into being Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE clients as we have the accounts that fold into our own house accounts. So that's one wave. 
Parametrics, the customization space, I think, is the second wave. Calvert funds and everything we've done through our own sustainability institute efforts combined with our Calvert's products and then the digitalization and how we're going to take the E*TRADE platform, both domestically and internationally, I think there's incredible opportunities. 
So it's pretty rare to sit here and having done this for a little while, there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business. But these are things where I think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves, and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting."

So how do you think about the question that Glenn asked, which is referrals? How do you see that referral channel going through in terms of dollars, et cetera? How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds falling through from those companion accounts? 
But the integration is a 3-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning. So I think right now, what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working. So to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early, I think, would also be a mistake because we'd like to ensure that it is the right client experience, and that's what we're focused on right now."

But when we look at what's been happening at Morgan Stanley, things already were accelerating before we entered into this period. And so one of the debates that has been coming up more regularly has been what is the right growth rate for the wealth business on a go-forward basis. 
I'll maybe throw out a range and from my perspective, it feels like somewhere in the mid- to upper single digits, 5% to 7% feels fair on a long run basis. But number one, I'd love to hear your reaction to that. And then number two, what -- how do you think about that growth rate? Do you guys have something in mind?

Obviously, as you look forward, though, we're doing a lot, both on net asset consolidation, net recruiting and all of these new channels. And so I don't think we -- the same way that James level set with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't -- that's probably the same way you can think about this. We're 5% to 6%, maybe that's the right place to start, but we're obviously not going to try to underachieve that number."

Because if we can generate growth in the high teens, I mean, I think we're -- what are we 9% year-to-date organic? I mean, this is just -- we've never seen this, right? And I've been doing this for a very long time. 
The 3 industry segments, basically, the warehouses, the sort of independents/RIAs and the direct channel, for years, the direct and -- has grown. The RIAs have grown in a large part because they've taken advisers that moved out of the traditional channel into the RIA channel. So part of the growth has just been a shift, if you will, out of inorganic. 
And the warehouses have sort of struggled, and they've struggled for a couple of reasons. One is poor training, two is very high attrition, three is lack of -- blowing the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, et cetera. And I think what you're seeing now, we think we're kind of creating a -- not to be arrogant about it, but a new mousetrap. 
We're creating an adviser channel, which actually has deep organic growth levers in it. And if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean, they're fantastic. And with that, we're getting tremendous asset growth. 
And then you combine that with having the direct platform and then combine that with having the workplace platform, you've got 3 legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't so long ago that if we did $10 billion a quarter, we thought we're pretty good. And we just had a $70 billion quarter during tax season, and it's good. I mean, it's very good. 
But we don't think it was a fluke. So I don't know where the ultimate number is going to settle. I think our assets in wealth are now around a little over $4.5 trillion. That was $500 billion 12, 14 years ago. So we're at $4.5 trillion. We've gone up 9x. 
Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force, as you know. So I don't know if it's going to -- it won't be below 5%. I mean, any individual quarter, you have stuff going on, but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6%, 7%, 8%, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years, but it feels good."

In addition to that, I would just highlight the SBL question that you asked. Look, that product is resonating with our clients. So that's the point there. And as James has always said, it's a product in which you lend wealthy clients their money back. 
And this is something that is resonating. It's structured very well. We've historically seen minimal losses, and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio.

So it might take a little while, get yourself a cup of coffee, put your feet up on the stool. So let's just start with I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever unless we go and screw it up basically. 
If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses and the wealth business and the fee-based businesses and asset management, they're for real, and they're every day. And they're not $10 million, they're $100 million. So you kind of locked in a $25 billion business right from day 1 of the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it would generate very consistent earnings. 
And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right. But my view was, certainly, the wealth business and the fee-based part of the asset management business, which is so predictable, we think of it as like a yield stock. And the Investment Banking and trading businesses and capital markets businesses and some of the carry businesses in asset management, we think is like the -- not that the other business is in a growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera. 
We've been carrying a buffer CET1 of over 17%. We have to be -- I think the latest around 13.2-ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally as we've said 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less than that. But just pretend it's 80 basis points, you're at 14. You've got 300-plus basis points to play with. 
We're generating net income in the first half of this year of $7 billion. Assume we are less than that in the second half, just because who knows, but we're certainly not going to be under $10 billion for the year and probably not under $12 billion. So you're talking about a buyback of 5 -- of $12 billion, a dividend of 5, that gets you to 17. You're generating at least 12. You're in the whole 5, but you've got 300 basis points of excess. It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. 
And we felt our shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream of the predictability of the businesses that we've got. We're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be. And the vast majority of them, if not all of them, went out of business or merged. 
We are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business. So we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile. [ 14-point, whatever it was, 8 billion ] in revenue this quarter. A little over 7 of it was institutional, a little over 7 of it was wealth and asset management. So it's exactly what we hoped, the sort of balance. That's the philosophy. 
Now it will take us a bunch of years unless CCAR changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer. And we're buying the stock back and the stock's over $90. We're very happy buying at this level, but at some point, obviously, that gets expensive. We do think we can do more deals over time, and we'll actively look at that, and we want to keep investing in the business. 
But the reality is, and this is like the ultimate conundrum, we can do all 4, buyback dividend, invest in acquisitions and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings, and that's not my solution currently. 
So let's play this out over a few years. I'm really happy we got the dividend as we call it a reset. And we have the authorization from the Board for up to $12 billion. And we'll go hard at that, particularly if the stock were to -- if we saw a big move in the market. But that's how I'm thinking about it and how the Board is thinking about it."

Obviously, that's -- in some of the overlay products, for example, we'll have lower fee rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other gives and takes. 
But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product. It's creating an ability to service the client more broadly. So while the overall fee rate might come down as was disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset parts of that on a total basis, right? A rate times volume kind of concept. 
In particular, you have the Parametric product, which we discussed, which has obviously has its own secular growth trends, the Calvert product. And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends, i.e., ESG, i.e., what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM. 
And in addition to that, I think that the Fixed Income products offer the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to Morgan Stanley. And so from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time. And so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio, but assets should continue to come in."

So folks have focused on the acquisition side, but we've also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by somebody else or just went to fit. 
Now [ Azores ], in Spain, I remember a quota in the U.K., our European private banking business we sold et cetera. So on the deal side, we've done -- Smith Barney, obviously, was the big one, and Mesa West was the first sort of toe in the water in Investment Management, then the Solium deal in the workplace space followed by E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. 
So all I'm saying is we don't have big transactions in line of sight at this point in time. But we're a big enough company. We're generating -- I don't know, we're running -- run rate, I guess, is $60 billion in revenues this year, $170-plus billion market cap. Finding the right things to fit in, particularly internationally, and particularly on the digital and technology side, is very interesting to us.

Asia, people look at it as though it's some monolith. It's not. Vietnam is not Indonesia. Malaysia is not Thailand. The Philippines is not Australia. [indiscernible] is not China, et cetera, et cetera. So you've got to -- it's very hard to get scale in these markets. That's issue number one. 
Issue number two, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not the diversified traditional financial planning. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan compared to the U.S. It's night and day. 
And thirdly, obviously, know your client, money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about cross-border type money flows, the bar is very high. And we're a conservative institution. We just are. So my view has been for a long time that you trade very carefully. 
You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm because we basically run it out of Miami and New York. So we run it as a region as a sync from single countries. And you go -- and we've done it in Hong Kong, where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of Hong Kong and Singapore, a little bit in Australia. But basically, you go where you have scale. 
So the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia, Indonesia. Hence, E*TRADE becomes a very interesting platform for that. 
Early days. That's the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally, but that's something I'll be very excited about."

And I said what I said at the time. If you don't reward your shareholders at some point as you remind us over the years, Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they pick up their bat and ball and go home. 
So given we were paying employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap, and they'd be rewarded. And I'm very, very happy for our employees that, that's, in fact, what's transpired. And the stock has gone from, obviously, a very low number to where we are today. 
The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I and others sitting in this room, Sharon and Jon, have developed our careers by being mentored by and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career. 
And I don't think you can do that sitting in home by yourself. I just -- I think there's a limit to how far as good as the Zoom technology is, how far that can take you. So what I said was that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by Labor Day. 
But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for. What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes great sense. They're individuals who have health issues. They're individuals who are looking after family members. 
In past years, we would have said, ""Well, that's sort of too bad."" Now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple of months to look after a healthy issue or family issue, we can manage that. Some people have extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that. 
So -- but the basic premise and right at the beginning of COVID, in February of, what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked, how would this end up? I think I said that I felt 80% of all [ employees worked ] will be done in one of our offices. And that's probably where it's going to end up, not 100% but not 0%."

And in the first 6",554,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first half with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management. And in the first 6 months of the year, we added over $250 billion of net new assets across both of those businesses. We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management, and in Investment Management, our asset mix is increasingly diverse and well positioned in key secular growth areas such as customization, private alternatives and sustainability.  
Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance. Equity remains the preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains, and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly.  
Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our integrations. Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics, such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but much more importantly, we're seeing long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement.  
This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and year-to-date were over 20%. Obviously, we're exceeding our longer-term targets of 17% plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-year, I want to assure you we are as focused on delivering top performance as ever. Though we're always subject to the broader macro environment, we will strive for continued outperformance.  
Now let me talk about the decision we announced 2 weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to 0 and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share. Over the past decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grow our dividend from $0.05 ultimately to $0.35 and increased our buyback from $0 to $5 billion.
I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment Management contribute durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what we are doing. As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share and also increased our buyback for up to $12 billion over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have on our business model and our performance over the past 3 Federal Reserve stress tests.  
These tests confirmed what we have said for many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital, and we have the ability to invest in our business, do acquisitions, maintain a very healthy dividend yield and increase our buyback. Given our current earnings momentum, it may take some time to fully distribute our capital, but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start.  
Now Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us. And as you know, Jon took on additional responsibilities as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1. So let me turn it over to Sharon, who will discuss the quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you."

The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses.",1534,"Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses.  
Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89. Our ROTCE was 19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our firm, which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions. 
Investing for growth remains a priority, while also managing our expense base. On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion, and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion. 
The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our firm efficiency ratio declined to 67%, excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business.  
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues in Investment Banking and Equities were offset by lower Fixed Income results. Underwriting was particularly robust, as issuance remained elevated. And despite lower volatility across asset classes, our Sales & Trading clients remained engaged.  
We ended the period on a strong footing, as clients were active through June. Investment Banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting.  
From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the strongest in over a decade. And while technology and health care remain areas of core strength, activity in financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate and other sectors supported higher revenues.  
Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continue to look for strategic opportunities as markets remain open and constructive.  
Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest on record and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion. The increase from the prior year was driven by traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally.  
Fixed Income underwriting revenues of $640 million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth.  
Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are #1 in this business globally. Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased interest in the region from both Asia and non-Asia-based clients.  
Cash and derivative results were robust, but declined versus the prior year against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased versus last year as average balances reached new highs.  
Fixed Income revenues were $1.7 billion. Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products. This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust compared to historical averages, but declined from the prior year as credit markets were relatively range bound and bid offer spreads compressed. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange on the back of lower volatility.
Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans, net of related hedges. Prior year results benefited from significant credit spread tightening.  
Turning to ISG lending. Our allowance for loan -- for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million, and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily related to one facility.  
Total ISG loans were flat. The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion, relative to the prior quarter.  
Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion. Excluding integration-related costs of $60 million, PBT was also a record of $1.7 billion, with a margin of 27.8%.  
Growth drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to $176 billion of -- which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half. Net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results.  
Further, we continue to see strength in net recruiting and retention also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business.  
Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained high.  
Self-directed daily average trades were 1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above-average levels for full year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-directed channel.  
Asset management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion, bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the amount for the full year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now $1.7 trillion or more than double the level of only 5 years ago.  
Bank lending balances grew by a record 10 billion, and balances reached 115 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full year expectation of 10%. This was driven by strong demand for securities-based lending.  
Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly. The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve.  
We have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021. For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels.  
The integration of E*TRADE is going well, and we continue to prioritize client experience. While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals.  
The workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are also gaining traction. We had 4x as many wins year-over-year.  
Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis.  
Revenues were $1.7 billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion, and total net flows were over $48 billion. Since we announced the acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increased diversification of this business was a significant driver of results.  
Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter and stands at a record high, of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion. The benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter.
Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw particular strength in alternatives and solutions driven primarily by demand for Parametric customized portfolios as well as a $1 billion strategic multi-asset partnership mandate. 
We continue to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms. Loan strategies and fixed income were particularly robust.  
Asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year, driven by strong AUM growth and the addition of Eaton Vance. 
Performance-based income and other revenues were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio. With the integration on pace, our very strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income and high conviction equity investing positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients.  
Turning to the balance sheet. Spot assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to $461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET1 requirement, including the SCB, of 13.2%.  
During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock or 34 million shares. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%.  
The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, we are starting the third quarter from a position of strength. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy. Dialogues are active, and markets are open. Wealth Management continues to retain and attract new clients, new advisers and new assets. Investment Management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform.  
With that, we will now open the line to questions."

So I'll come back to that.  
In the institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market leader in that. We will pick up share over time.  
Clearly, in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot of the middle market M&A space is very fertile. There are different parts of the world we still think we can punch above our weight. So I actually think both of those, the equities business is as good as it is, and M&A is as good as it is. I actually think there's real upside in both of those.  
In the Fixed Income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1 billion a quarter. We raised it to $1.5 billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter of $1.7 billion. As rates normalize and as the Fixed Income fee pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of space there.  
In the SPG credit side, we've got a world-class business there, again, continuing to grow share, and our commodities business is doing very well. So the IC franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to this quarter was 7, was a little -- it was, frankly, better than we had expected coming into it, which is terrific. 
But it's very interesting. I mean, the share gains across -- and it's not just us. Some of the other big players in the U.S. are real and I think enduring. And as the global economies recover and the fee pool increases, you'll just see more of that. So I feel very confident about the ISG business."

We see the retention of assets. We see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice. So we're working with the clients, and we're trying out new technologies, and we'll go from there. So it's really about conversion of clients and then the retention of assets, but it all seems to be working very well."

I think, every now and then in business, you look and you sort of see a wave coming, and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing. The whole workplace space to me is the next major growth area in financial services.  
I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at that Solium transaction, which, at the time, some people thought was expensive, and it was. I think we spent 800 or 900 on it, might have been Canadian dollars. So somewhere around there, and it was trading at about 500 value.  
That gave us the opportunity to do the E*TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients ultimately into being Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE clients as we have the accounts that fold into our own house accounts. So that's one wave.  
Parametric, the customization space, I think, is the second wave. Calvert funds and everything we've done through our own sustainability institute efforts combined with now Calvert's products and then the digitalization and how we're going to take the E*TRADE platform, both domestically and internationally, I think there's incredible opportunities.  
So it's pretty rare to sit here, and having done this for a little while, there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business. But these are things where I think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves, and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting."

Or are there going to be more regular updates where we're going to be able to hear about the work that you're doing?

So how do you think about the question that Glenn asked, which is referrals? How do you see that referral channel going through in terms of dollars, et cetera? How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds falling through from those companion accounts?  
But the integration is a 3-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning. So I think, right now, what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working. 
So to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early, I think, would also be a mistake because we'd like to ensure that it is the right client experience, and that's what we're focused on right now."

And I think most investors think it's going to slow. This past year has been a little unusual.  
But when we look at what's been happening at Morgan Stanley, things already were accelerating before we entered into this period. And so one of the debates that has been coming up more regularly has been what is the right growth rate for the wealth business on a go-forward basis. I'll maybe throw out a range and from my perspective, it feels like somewhere in the mid- to upper single digits. 5% to 7% feels fair on a long-run basis. 
But number one, I'd love to hear your reaction to that. And then number two, what -- how do you think about that growth rate? Do you guys have something in mind? Is there something that you're targeting? Any color on that would be really helpful."

And so I don't think we -- the same way that James level set, with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't -- that's probably the same way you can think about this.

The 3 industry segments, basically, the wirehouses, the sort of independents/RIAs and the direct channel, for years, the direct and -- has grown. The RIAs have grown in a large part because they've taken advisers that moved out of the traditional channel into the RIA channel. So part of the growth has just been a shift, if you will, out of inorganic.  
And the wirehouses have sort of struggled, and they've struggled for a couple of reasons. One is poor training, two is very high attrition, three is lack of [ luring ] the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, et cetera. And I think what you're seeing now, we think we're kind of creating a -- not to be arrogant about it, but a new mousetrap.  
We're creating an adviser channel, which actually has deep organic growth levers in it. And if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean, they're fantastic. And with that, we're getting tremendous asset growth.  
And then you combine that with having the direct platform and then combine that with having the workplace platform, you've got 3 legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't so long ago that if we did $10 billion a quarter, we thought we're pretty good. And we just had a $70 billion quarter during tax season, and it's good. I mean, it's very good.  
But we don't think it was a fluke. So I don't know where the ultimate number is going to settle. I think our assets in wealth are now around a little over $4.5 trillion. That was $500 billion 12, 14 years ago. So we're at $4.5 trillion. We've gone up 9x.  
Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force, as you know. So I don't know if it's going to -- it won't be below 5%. I mean, any individual quarter, you have stuff going on, but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6%, 7%, 8%, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years, but it feels good."

We've historically seen minimal losses, and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio.

So let's just start with I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever, unless we go and screw it up basically. 
If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses and the wealth business and the fee-based businesses and asset management, they're for real, and they're every day. And they're not $10 million. They're $100 million. So you kind of locked in a $25 billion business right from day 1 in the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it would generate very consistent earnings. 
And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right. But my view was, certainly, the wealth business and the fee-based part of the asset management business, which is so predictable, we think of it as like a yield stock. 
And the Investment Banking and trading businesses and capital markets businesses and some of the carry businesses in asset management, we think, is like the -- not that the other business is in a growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera. 
We've been carrying a buffer CET1 of over 17%. We have to be -- I think the latest CCAR was around 13.2-ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally. As we've said 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less than that. But just pretend that's 80 basis points. You're at 14. You've got 300-plus basis points to play with. 
We're generating net income in the first half of this year of $7 billion. Assume we are less than that in the second half, just because who knows, but we're certainly not going to be under $10 billion for the year and probably not under $12 billion. 
So you're talking about a buyback of 5 -- of $12 billion, a dividend of 5, that gets you to 17. You're generating at least 12. You're in the hole for 5, but you've got 300 basis points of excess. It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. 
And we felt our shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream of the predictability of the businesses that we've got. We're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be. And the vast majority of them, if not all of them, went out of business or merged. 
We are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business, so we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile. [ 14-point, whatever it was, 8 billion ] in revenue this quarter, a little over 7 of it was institutional, a little over 7 of it was wealth and asset management. So it's exactly what we hoped, the sort of balance. That's the philosophy. 
Now it will take us a bunch of years, unless CCAR changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer. And we're buying the stock back, and the stock is over $90. We're very happy buying at this level. But at some point, obviously, that gets expensive. 
We do think we can do more deals over time, and we're -- we'll actively look at that, and we want to keep investing in the business. But the reality is, and this is like the ultimate conundrum, we can do all 4: buyback; dividend; invest ; and acquisitions, and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings, and that's not my solution currently. 
So let's play this out over a few years. I'm really happy we got the dividend, as we call it a reset. And we have the authorization from the Board for up to $12 billion. And we'll go hard at that, particularly if the stock were to -- if we saw a big move in the market. But that's how I'm thinking about it and how the Board is thinking about it."

So my questions are on Investment Management and the inclusion of Eaton Vance. In last quarter's 10-Q, you noted that certain Eaton Vance products have lower average fee rates than the standalone Morgan Stanley Investment Management platform.

Obviously, that's -- in some of the overlay products, for example, we'll have lower fee rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other gives and takes. 
But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product. It's creating an ability to service the client more broadly. So while the overall fee rate might come down, as was disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset parts of that on a total basis, right, a rate times volume kind of concept. 
In particular, you have the Parametric product, which we discussed, which has obviously has its own secular growth trends, the Calvert product. And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends, i.e., ESG, i.e., what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM. 
And in addition to that, I think that the Fixed Income products offer the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to Morgan Stanley. And so from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time. And so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio, but assets should continue to come in."

Asia people look at it as though it's some monolith. It's not. Vietnam is not Indonesia. Malaysia is not Thailand. The Philippines is not Australia. Korea is not China, et cetera, et cetera. So you've got to -- it's very hard to get scale in these markets. That's issue number one. 
Issue number two, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not the diversified traditional financial planning. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan compared to the U.S. It's night and day. 
And thirdly, obviously, know your client. Money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about cross-border type money flows, the bar is very high. And we're a conservative institution. We just are. 
So my view has been for a long time that you trade very carefully. You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm because we basically run it out of Miami and New York. So we run it as a region as a sync from single countries. And you go -- and we've done it in Hong Kong, where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of Hong Kong and Singapore, a little bit in Australia. But basically, you go where you have scale. 
So the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital and electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia or Indonesia. Hence, E*TRADE becomes a very interesting platform for that. 
Early days. That's the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally, but that's something I'll be very excited about."

We created a group of what we call the distinguished engineers. 
And interestingly, and people don't think of it this way, but I think we've done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks maybe in the world by spending $13 billion on a technology company called E*TRADE, which is basically technology and brand.

And I said what I said at the time. 
If you don't reward your shareholders at some point, as you remind us over the years, Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they pick up their bat and ball and go home. 
So given we were paying employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap, and they'd be rewarded. And I'm very, very happy for our employees that, that's, in fact, what's transpired. And the stock has gone from, obviously, a very low number to where we are today. 
The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I and others sitting in this room, Sharon and Jon, have developed our careers is by being mentored by and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career. And I don't think you can do that sitting at home by yourself. 
I just -- I think there's a limit to how far as good as the Zoom technology is, how far that can take you. So what I said was that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by Labor Day. But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for. 
What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes great sense. There are individuals who have health issues. There are individuals who are looking after family members. In past years, we would have said, ""Well, that's sort of too bad."" Now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple of months to look after a health issue or a family issue, we can manage that. 
Some people have extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that. So -- but the basic premise, and right at the beginning of COVID, in February of, what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked how would this end up, I think I said that I felt 80% of all employee hours worked will be done in one of our offices.

But particularly, we've talked a lot about the customization of Parametric. I don't think that's just Wealth Management. I think that's a workplace product as well over time, so not just an adviser-led product. 
Alternatives private credit is one where I think we've seen an interest, and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the Wealth Management franchises more broadly, not just our own. 
And as you think about ESG, we had always talked about Eaton Vance and the old MSIM being a ""perfect fit"" in terms of the 2. And I think a lot of that came from the distribution and the complementary distribution that you had. 
So ESG products and Calvert was an Eaton Vance product with a U.S. domestic sales force. We have a strong international sales force. And obviously, a lot of the interest in the ESG and sustainability products are also coming from Europe and abroad. And so that's where we think that, that distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere."

It was an exceptional third quarter, this -- the firm delivered, and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of $45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full year 2019",684,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It was an exceptional third quarter, this -- the firm delivered, and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of $45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage. 
Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns and strong operating leverage, and we produced an ROTCE of over 20% both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Institutional Securities continues to gain share. It performed strongly across all regions and all 3 major businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across Investment Banking is clearly paying dividends. Of note, Investment Banking had its best quarter in history. And within that, M&A also produced its own record quarter. Equities were extremely strong and Fixed Income was stable. The Wealth Management business, which includes E*TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far beyond what we've seen. Through the first 9 months, this business added over $300 billion of net new assets, compounding growth on a client asset base of over $4.6 trillion. And we believe this is going to be an economic engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come. 
The majority of our advisers had positive net new assets year-to-date, and it's this broad-based strength that's key to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and workplace. Self-directed client engagement remains elevated. U.S. corporate stock plan wins increased over 90% versus last year. In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially through Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now have in excess of 14 million unique relationships. 
While it's early days, we believe that over time, Morgan Stanley at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business, providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader wealth management services. 
In Investment Management, fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way, that's nearly triple the average quarterly level of 5 years ago. Our $1.5 trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of value we can provide clients, expanded solutions in customization, sustainability and value-added fixed income along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date, net flows within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion. 
Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back 3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan and doubled our dividend, thereby delivering shareholders nearly 3% return. All that said, we're not complacent in what is obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment. We do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon, and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. We remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we will exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way. 
A final word on capital. As you know, SA-CCR, the standardized counterparty credit risk regulatory changes beginning next year for the largest banks. It impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risk and thus, risk-weighted assets. We've decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs and, with that, lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1 ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of third quarter, is 16%. The pro forma impact of SA-CCR, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120 basis points. Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in future CCAR tests, which may itself offset a part of this impact over time. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Sharon and discuss -- she will discuss the quarter in greater detail, and then we'll both take your questions. Thank you."

The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to-d",1540,"Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continues to power performance with particular strength in Investment Banking and Equities. Wealth Management and Investment Management each set year-to-date records. While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%. 
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5  billion in revenues. Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. Balanced revenue supported overall results. Advisory, in particular, was a standout with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly, Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pretax margin, which was 38% year-to-date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year. 
Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting through the quarter's results. 
The Americas and Europe led the year-over-year increase. Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year. 
Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter at or above this level. The increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products. 
Fixed income underwriting revenues were $567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in noninvestment-grade loans supported by the combination of the rate environment and elevated levels of event-driven activity. 
Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions, and activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital, and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth. 
Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our Equities business remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activity throughout the quarter. 
Revenues in Asia were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint. Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued through the summer months. Prime Brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels. 
Fixed Income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third quarter. Micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues in securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year, which benefited from wider bid offer spreads. Macro also declined versus last year with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. Commodities was strong and revenues improved versus the prior year as North America power and gas benefited from robust client activity. 
Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%. Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the margin was 27.7%. We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets, which underscores the power of the asset gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced, inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients, stock plan vesting events and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA exceeds $300 billion, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. 
In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets and fee-based flows. We are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets, who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools delivered through the financial wellness platform, deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to adviser-led or self-directed clients based on their individual needs. It's at the core of our expansion strategy. The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by the momentum in the workplace. 
Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have nearly $500 billion in unvested assets. In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4%, in line with seasonal patterns. Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately $960,000 in the quarter, in line with the average level for the full year of 2020. 
While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year, client engagement remains high. Starts this quarter were 3x above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition record. Asset management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 5% sequentially. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29% to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flows supports our view that clients first consolidate assets onto our platform and then migrate these assets to advisory. 
Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase. reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation. 
Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter, but it did impact the sequential move. Excluding for prepay for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter. 
The integration of E*TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose to provide their Morgan Stanley adviser with visibility into their E*TRADE accounts. By year-end, clients will be able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on, building on our digital client experience. 
Moving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion, declining 15%. While asset management and related fees rose sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue. Total AUM remained strong at $1.5 trillion. Net -- total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager. The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us, and we expect the remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022 as the asset manager brings its equity trading implementation in-house. Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows with continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios, private real estate and private credit and sustainable strategies through both Calvert and MSM Fund. 
Asset management and related fees were $1.5 billion reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equities business primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helped mitigate this overall impact. 
Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas, particularly sustainability, alternatives and customization for wealth management platforms and clients. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $11 billion, primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%. 
As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SA-CCR during the fourth quarter this year after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics, such as the future SCB calculations. With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately $35 billion to $45 billion. This would also apply a reduction to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts, which should offset some of the impact to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR. 
We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing. We are capturing share in institutional securities. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy. We are excited by the momentum we see in Wealth Management's ability to attract and consolidate assets and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses. With that, we will now open the line up to questions."

The accent is so different. On SA-CCR, I mean, it affects counterparty credit risk. There were models that were in place that Basel has been working on replacing actually starting 2014, and the idea was to implement it in 2017, and they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin are not margin, how to treat that from a risk-weighted asset perspective. So there's a complicated formula that applies a weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment obligations under various contracts. 
So it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think, during COVID. They've given the banks until the beginning of next year to get -- to put it in place, and they're allowing banks to preannounce. The benefit of starting early is that affects the peak to trough in your CCAR calculations during the CCAR cycle. So there will be some offsets later. And we just felt we need to get -- we needed to get into it sooner rather than later. Most of it is in ISG. I think about -- let's say, the RWA number, I think we've got it $35 billion to $45 billion. Honestly, that's moving around a little bit because we're -- there's complicated stuff, but we certainly don't think it's worse, and hopefully, it's the lower end of that.

You had existing clients who maybe brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. You had financial advisers who left and who you recruited. And for many years, we were, frankly, net deficit of financial advisers as were, frankly, most of the broker dealers in my 30 years of doing this. 
A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. we are seeing net positive attrition, very few advisers leaving and significant advisers coming, particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry. So that's positive. The channel that the workplace has opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the driver between -- behind this quarter's numbers is basically a new channel. And then, obviously, the E*TRADE channel is a new channel. And now you're seeing this sort of acquisition of of RIA-type teams, of which this is one. 
So it's gone from sort of a one model, a defense-and-attack model of keep your people and try and get some of the marketplace, to a multipronged model, which if we -- obviously, we can't predict the future, but it looks like this is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead, which is the strategy."

But I think that the synergies, as they've played out, are very strong. We obviously never gave a direct revenue target. 
But if you think about what E*TRADE was doing, the concept was always, well, how do you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. And so we're seeing our teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research, et cetera, and advice that you would see through your adviser also through your E*TRADE portal.

Or is it more of a structural change in the private markets? And any comments you could share on future industry pipelines for direct listings?"

So these are specific situations. But I would say that, that -- while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results, what I would focus you on for advisory are 2 things. One is the diversification across the sectors and the geography. So what we're seeing is not just one product necessarily driving results or one sector driving results but rather that the pipeline broadly are healthy. And as James said last year, we continue to invest in this business. So I think that's sort of where we -- how we think about the business going forward."

And I'm talking about capital markets here, Gerard. It's -- the barriers to entry for those businesses, if you look at a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that tried to be global investment banks and didn't work out so well, the scale economics of it, the barriers to entry just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating sort of the global flow of capital markets. 
So -- and within that, we're obviously performing very well. We've picked up a lot of share consistently across Fixed Income and Equities and, increasingly, in banking over the last several years. I don't see that abating. I mean I don't see a compelling reason why that would change. 
In the wealth and asset management space, again, scale is your friend. We've done 2 huge deals in the last year and then Smith Barney a decade ago at 6.5-ish unit. Clearly, at scale. We're one of the biggest asset managers and wealth managers in the world, and that generates about $30 billion in revenue. Again, it's hard to pick up advisers one by one, and there aren't that many firms out there of size that really move the needle on scale and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Schwabb-Ameritrade deal, which combined 2 competitors. You've got Fidelity, you've got a couple of smaller ones but E*TRADE was kind of the last big one that was available. So I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. It doesn't mean it can't. I mean -- but that would be more internal, what we've done to ourselves and external what the market is going to do to us is my gut on that. 
Volatility, I mean, you're just -- you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at day-to-day movements in market prices. You're looking at when  the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is, what they start signaling in terms of how many dots suggest there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, 4 to 9. That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around obviously, U.S.-China relationships, Taiwan, that injects volatility. So like anything, we look at sort of monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics and then see how that bleeds into market activity. And from that, we get -- we sort of dial up or down on the margin, our risk and our -- you look at specific transactions. You look at multiples of EBITDA, the deals are done at. You're looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals. I mean there's a lot of sort of more tactical stuff, but I try and take a thematic view. 
My thematic view is it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues, but it's -- the markets are bouncing a little bit. And over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the Fed starts to move."

And then you're also going to be providing services to Microsoft to help them position their business. But I wasn't really clear on that.

Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest company in the world, so a fantastic partner for us. We did do a multiyear deal with them. I won't give you the financials, as you would understand, but a multiyear deal with them. And by the way, they're not the only cloud provider we use. We use -- there are great players in AWS and Google, and we have relationships with all of them. But we wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data, gives us time to market tools. There's more resilience and flexibility in the cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're using to improve our client experience we do through the cloud. So it's one of the pillars of our technology strategy. 
We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in wealth management with some of the virtual financial adviser, the LeadIQ platform, next best ideas, these kinds of things. They're all AI-driven. And I think what you're seeing is with, first, the acquisition of Solium and then in E*TRADE, our wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone. And we've been driving a lot of innovation in that space. 
The cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one and I think will just lead to a much more efficient Morgan Stanley and more resilient, by the way. But it's not solely Microsoft. We're very proud of our partnership with them but we're a huge company, and we're going to keep evolving. We have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that we're working on that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call. That's between us and Microsoft.

We have some unbelievably capable engineers, software engineers, computer scientists around the world, who work with us, and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm. 
So no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud, and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just -- I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a more efficient, more resilient and faster-moving player.

We have a weekly report, which I get every Friday night about 7:15 and scrutinize it pretty closely. It shows which people we've recruited, what their trailing 12 months revenue are, what their assets are and then which funds that we lose to different competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. And as I said, I've been doing this a long time. And at my previous firm and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisers to RIAs. We're moving them sometimes to private banks. You're losing some of the smaller producers to places like [ Linsco Private Ledger ]. That has all turned. 
And I think the power of the brand, I mean, if you're at the beauty of having this integrated investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management businesses, you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisers, world-class old platforms through infrastructure, mezz finance, private equity, real estate. But you've also got new issuance. I mean we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a world-class adviser managing -- some of our advisers have teams of -- they're managing books of $20 billion and $30 billion, I mean they are enormous operations themselves. 
So do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisers. Plus the research which we amortize across the cost of all the 3 platforms enables us to invest more in research than you do if you're just a wealth shop or you're just an institutional shop. 
So again, we don't break down individual teams, but -- and it's more than anecdotal. I have the numbers, obviously, in front of me, well, not literally in front of me, but in my office, and it's real. We're getting very big teams coming in."

And so that's driving investor questions around how much of this is structural versus just being in a great cycle. And as we think about, I guess, Sharon, some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role, I'm just curious like how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today relative to maybe a few years ago because, clearly, that's an area where there's more capital and sponsors are kind of always transacting.

I think that if you think about sponsors and -- but if you really think about everything, right, what's going on is you have cash that you've raised in debt in other parts of the market, given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic. And so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor, et cetera. And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth, either from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsors lens. So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business, though, and that's the point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. So you might look at a financial sponsor as a sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary, et cetera, all of that -- those -- that pie in terms of where it's coming from is changing. And that diversification, I think, is what's helping the activity. 
And I think that corporations are looking for growth. And so I'd say that it's not just one sleeve that is driving what the results that you saw at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline."

And so when you think about where we came from and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. And so while there is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's technology that James mentioned that's also in the loan space. 
So if you are an adviser and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked at your client, looked a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You'll speak to your client about the product that you might have. And so I think that, that extension of how you use technology to service your client better and then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides further runway for growth along that space."

It was an exceptional third quarter. This -- the firm delivered and has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $45 billion.

This -- the firm delivered and has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage. 
Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns and strong operating leverage, and we produced an ROTCE of over 20%, both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
Institutional Securities continues to gain share and performed strongly across all regions and all 3 major businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across Investment Banking is clearly paying dividends. 
Of note, Investment Banking had its best quarter in history. And within that, M&A also produced its own record quarter. Equities were extremely strong, and Fixed Income was stable. 
The Wealth Management business, which includes E*TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far beyond what we've seen. Through the first 9 months, this business added over $300 billion of net new assets, compounding growth on a client asset base of over $4.6 trillion, and we believe this is going to be an economic engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come.  
The majority of our advisers had positive net new assets year-to-date, and it's this broad-based strength that's key to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and workplace. 
Self-directed client engagement remains elevated. U.S. corporate stock plan wins increased over 90% versus last year. In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially through Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now have in excess of 14 million unique relationships.  
While it's early days, we believe that, over time, Morgan Stanley at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business, providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader Wealth Management services.  
In Investment Management, fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way, that's nearly triple the average quarterly level of 5 years ago. Our $1.5 trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of value we can provide clients, expanded solutions in customization, sustainability and value-added fixed income, along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date, net flows within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion.  
Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back $3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan, and doubled our dividend, thereby delivering shareholders nearly 3% return. 
All that said, we're not complacent in what is obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment. We do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon, and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. 
We remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we will exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way.  
A final word on capital. As you know, SACCR, the standardized counterparty credit risk regulatory, changes beginning next year for the largest banks. It impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risk and, thus, risk-weighted assets. 
We've decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs and, with that, lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1 ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of third quarter is 16%. The pro forma impact of SACCR, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120 basis points.  
Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in future CCAR tests, which may itself offset a part of this impact over time.  
I'm now going to turn the call over to Sharon and discuss -- she will discuss the quarter in greater detail, and then we'll both take your questions. Thank you."
472898,1681518023,2406253,"Morgan Stanley, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2021",2021-10-14,"Earnings Calls","Morgan Stanley","Executives","Thank you, and good morning.

Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to",1540,"Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. 
Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continues to power performance, with particular strength in Investment Banking and Equities. Wealth Management and Investment Management each set year-to-date records. 
While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%.  
Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5 billion in revenues. Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. Balanced revenue supported overall results. 
Advisory, in particular, was a standout, with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly, Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pretax margin, which was 38% year-to-date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year.  
Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarter's results. The Americas and Europe led the year-over-year increase. 
Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year.  
Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter at or above this level. The increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products.  
Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in noninvestment-grade loans, supported by the combination of the rate environment and elevated levels of event-driven activity.  
Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions, and activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital, and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth.  
Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our Equities business remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activity throughout the quarter. Revenues in Asia were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint. 
Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued through the summer months. Prime Brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels.  
Fixed Income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third quarter. 
Micro results remained above historical averages, but reflected lower revenues in securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year, which benefited from wider bid offer spreads. 
Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. 
Commodities was strong, and revenues improved versus the prior year as North America power and gas benefited from robust client activity.  
Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%. Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the margin was 27.7%. 
We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets, which underscores the power of the asset gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced, inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients, stock plan vesting events and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA exceeds $300 billion, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets.
In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets and fee-based flows. 
We are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets, who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools delivered through the financial wellness platform, deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to adviser-led or self-directed clients based on their individual needs. It's at the core of our expansion strategy.  
The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by the momentum in the workplace. 
Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have nearly $500 billion in unvested assets. 
In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4%, in line with seasonal patterns. 
Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately $960,000 in the quarter, in line with the average level for the full year of 2020.  
While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year, client engagement remains high. Starts this quarter were 3x above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition record. 
Asset management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 5% sequentially. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29% to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flows supports our view that clients first consolidate assets onto our platform and then migrate these assets to advisory.  
Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase, reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation.  
Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter, but it did impact the sequential move. Excluding for prepay for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter.  
The integration of E*TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose to provide their Morgan Stanley adviser with visibility into their E*TRADE accounts. By year-end, clients will be able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on, building on our digital client experience.  
Moving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion, declining 15%. While asset management and related fees rose sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue. 
Total AUM remained strong at $1.5 trillion. Net -- total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager. 
The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us, and we expect the remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022, as the asset manager brings its equity trading implementation in-house. 
Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows, with continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios, private real estate and private credit and sustainable strategies through both Calvert and MSIM Funds.  
Asset management and related fees were $1.5 billion, reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equities business primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helped mitigate this overall impact.  
Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas, particularly sustainability, alternatives and customization for wealth management platforms and clients.  
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $11 billion primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. 
We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%.  
As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SACCR during the fourth quarter this year after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics, such as the future SCB calculations. 
With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately $35 billion to $45 billion. This would also apply a reduction to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts, which should offset some of the impact to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well capitalized post the adoption of SACCR.  
We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing. We are capturing share in institutional securities. Clients remain engaged, and pipelines are healthy. 
We are excited by the momentum we see in Wealth Management's ability to attract and consolidate assets and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses. 
With that, we will now open the line up to questions."

The accent is so different. On SACCR, I mean, it affects counterparty credit risk. There were models that were in place that Basel has been working on replacing, actually starting 2014, and the idea was to implement it in 2017. 
And they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin are not margin, how to treat that from a risk-weighted asset perspective. So there's a complicated formula that applies a weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment obligations under various contracts.  
So it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think, during COVID. They've given the banks until the beginning of next year to get -- to put it in place, and they're allowing banks to preannounce it. 
The benefit of starting early is that affects the peak to trough in your CCAR calculations during the CCAR cycle, so there will be some offsets later. And we just felt we need to get -- we needed to get into it sooner rather than later. 
Most of it is in ISG. I think about -- if let's say, the RWA number, I think we've got at $35 billion to $45 billion, honestly, that's moving around a little bit because we're -- there's complicated stuff. But we certainly don't think it's worse. And hopefully, it's the lower end of that.

So if you think of retirement assets and then you think of who's the actual holder of those retirement assets, and those are the participants through municipalities pensions, et cetera, then all of a sudden, you have just another layer of people that you first offer financial wellness and education to.

You had existing clients who maybe brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. 
You had financial advisers who left and who you recruited. And for many years, we were, frankly, net deficit of financial advisers as were frankly most of the broker dealers in my 30 years of doing this.  
A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. We are seeing net positive attrition, very few advisers leaving and significant advisers coming, particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry. So that's positive. 
The channel that the workplace has opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the driver between -- behind this quarter's numbers is basically a new channel. And then, obviously, the E*TRADE channel is a new channel, and now you're seeing this sort of acquisition of RIA-type teams, of which this is one.  
So it's gone from sort of a one model, a defense-and-attack model of keep your people and try and get some of the marketplace, to a multipronged model, which if we -- obviously, we can't predict the future.

Obviously, there were different metrics as you think about what E*TRADE defined as retention and how you might define retention going forward given this new structure. 
But I think that the synergies, as they've played out, are very strong. We obviously never gave a direct revenue target. But if you think about what E*TRADE was doing, it's -- the concept was always, well, how do you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. 
And so we're seeing our teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research, et cetera, and advice that you would see through your adviser also through your E*TRADE portal.

It's -- the barriers to entry for those businesses, if you look at a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that tried to be global investment banks and didn't work out so well, the scale economics of it, the barriers to entry are just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating sort of the global flow of capital markets. 
So -- and within that, we're obviously performing very well. We've picked up a lot of share consistently across Fixed Income and Equities and, increasingly, in banking over the last several years. I don't see that abating. I mean, I don't see a compelling reason why that would change. 
In the wealth and asset management space, again, scale is your friend. We've done 2 huge deals in the last year and then Smith Barney a decade ago at $6.5-ish trillion. Clearly, at scale, we're one of the biggest asset managers and wealth managers in the world, and that generates about $30 billion in revenue. 
Again, it's hard to pick up advisers one by one, and there aren't that many firms out there of size that really move the needle on scale, and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Schwab-Ameritrade deal, which combined 2 competitors. You've got Fidelity. You've got a couple of smaller ones, but E*TRADE was kind of the last big one that was available. 
So I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. It doesn't mean it can't. I mean -- but that would be more internal, what we've done to ourselves and external what the market is going to do to us is my gut on that. 
Volatility, I mean, you're just -- you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at day-to-day movements in market prices. You're looking at when the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is, what they start signaling in terms of how many dots suggest there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, 4 to 9. That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around, obviously, U.S.-China relationships, Taiwan, that injects volatility. 
So like anything, we look at sort of monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics and then see how that bleeds into market activity. And from that, we get -- we sort of dial up or down on the margin our risk and you're looking -- you look at specific transactions, you look at multiples of EBITDA, the deals are done at, you're looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals. I mean, there's a lot of sort of more tactical stuff, but I try and take a thematic view. 
And my thematic view is it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues, but it's -- the markets are bouncing a little bit. And over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the Fed starts to move."

It looks like you're going to use Microsoft to transition more to the public cloud, if I have that correctly. And then you're also going to be providing services to Microsoft to help them position their business, but I wasn't really clear on that. 
So if you could get -- to mention that, talk about maybe efficiency benefits by using the cloud, how much do you want to transition your workload to the cloud and then what is it that you'd be doing in return."

Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest company in the world, so a fantastic partner for us. 
We did do a multiyear deal with them. I won't give you the financials, as you would understand, but a multiyear deal with them. And by the way, they're not the only cloud provider we use. We use -- there are great players in AWS and Google, and we have relationships with all of them. 
But we wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data, gives us time to market tools. There's more resilience and flexibility in the cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're using to improve our client experience, we do through the cloud. So it's one of the pillars of our technology strategy. 
We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in wealth management with some of the virtual financial adviser, the LeadIQ platform, next best ideas, these kinds of things, they're all AI-driven. 
And I think what you're seeing is with, first, the acquisition of Solium and then in E*TRADE, our wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone. And we've been driving a lot of innovation in that space. 
The cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one and I think will just lead to a much more efficient Morgan Stanley and more resilient, by the way. But it's not solely Microsoft. We're very proud of our partnership with them, but we're a huge company, and we're going to keep evolving. 
We have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that we're working on that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call. That's between us and Microsoft. But it's a great move, Mike. We're really happy about it."

Capital One is a very different business model. They don't do M&A. They don't underwrite equity deals. They don't have global trading businesses. 
So it's really a function -- you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies. 
One of the programs Rob Rooney and the team set up several years ago was something we call our distinguished engineers. We have some unbelievably capable engineers, software engineers, computer scientists around the world who work with us, and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm. 
So no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud, and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just -- I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a more efficient, more resilient and faster-moving player. And frankly, being in partnership with Microsoft is a very good thing for Morgan Stanley. They're best-in-class as a company -- as a tech company."

We don't -- Dan, we don't put out numbers on actual teams that we bring. We have a weekly report, which I get every Friday night about 7:15 and scrutinize it pretty closely, and it shows which people we've recruited, what their trailing 12-month revenue are, what their assets are and then which funds that we lose to different competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. 
And as I said, I've been doing this a long time. And at my previous firm and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisers to RIAs. We're moving them sometimes to private banks. You're losing some of the smaller producers to places like Linsco Private Ledger. That has all turned. 
And I think the power of the brand, I mean, if you're at the beauty of having this integrated investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management businesses, you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisers world-class old platforms through infrastructure, mezz finance, private equity, real estate. 
But you've also got new issuance. I mean, we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a world-class adviser managing -- some of our advisers have teams of -- they're managing books of $20 billion and $30 billion. I mean, they are enormous operations themselves. 
So if -- do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. 
So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisers, plus the research which we amortize across the cost of all the 3 platforms enables us to invest more in research than you do if you're just a wealth shop or you're just an institutional shop. 
So again, we don't break down individual teams, but -- and it's more than anecdotal. I have the numbers, obviously, in front of me, well, not literally in front of me, but in my office, and it's real. We're getting very big teams coming in."

It feels like a number of the areas are still actually seeing acceleration, even in the third quarter like advisory. And so that's driving investor questions around how much of this is structural versus just being in a great cycle. 
And as we think about, I guess, Sharon, some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role, I'm just curious like how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today relative to maybe a few years ago because, clearly, that's an area where there's more capital, and sponsors are kind of always transacting.

I think that if you think about sponsors and -- but if you really think about everything, right, what's going on is you have cash that you've raised in debt in other parts of the market given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic. And so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor, et cetera. 
And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth, either from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsors lens. So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business, though, and that's the point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. 
So you might look at a financial sponsor as a sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary, et cetera, all of that -- those -- that pie in terms of where it's coming from is changing. And that diversification, I think, is what's helping the activity. And I think that corporations are looking for growth. 
And so I'd say that it's not just one sleeve that is driving what the results that you saw at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline."

And so when you think about where we came from and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. 
And so while there is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's technology that James mentioned that's also in the loan space. So if you are an adviser and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked at your client, they've looked a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You'll speak to your client about the product that you might have. 
And so I think that, that extension of how you use technology to service your client better and then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides further runway for growth along that space."
