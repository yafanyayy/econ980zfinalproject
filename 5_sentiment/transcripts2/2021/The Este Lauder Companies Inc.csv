Let me first wish that each of you are in good health and that your families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. And our focus remains, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees, their families and our consumers. 
To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional well-being of colleagues, to making hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to the Estée Care Employee Relief Fund and so much more. In December, the company made an additional donation to the employees' fund, and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments. 
Our employees' agility and creativity empowered the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3%, a 12-point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively, 10 brands grew led by the double-digit from Estée Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Frédéric Malle also rose double digits. We focused our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas, delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. 
In the quarter, we faced increasingly complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered results that exceeded our record second half quarter of fiscal year 2020, when sales grew the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with agility in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online. 
Our skin care category performed extraordinarily. Its accelerating growth reflected the strong and locally relevant innovation, successful hero strategies, compelling ingredient narratives, and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high-repeat hero products was broad-based across our categories from cleansers to watery lotions, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to go from strength to strength, bolstered by the piece of mind of the ritual of skin care as an expression of self-care. 
From entry prestige through luxury, our brands excelled in skin care. Many brands contributed, demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart+ provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth with its appealing derm brand positioning. 
The Estée Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of its hero franchises in skin care. Its new advanced repair serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula and luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to advanced repair eye. And these 2 hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets. 
The brand's revitalizing Supreme franchise accelerated significantly. Gaining momentum with its hero moisturizer, la Mer, leadership in luxury skin care grew as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven efficacy [indiscernible]. Here, [2 serum] was a vibrant subcategory. Its new concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying strengths of heroes like La Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genasense La de Mer concentrated night performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs. 
Clinique returned to growth, lifted by skin care, as its hero franchises that are focused on hard-to-solve skin care problems like acne and dark spot thrived. Even Better Clinical Interruptor is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complemented by an acceleration the brand's 3 Step product and acne solution lines. 
Our luxury and artisanal fragrances captivated consumer desires. For Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Frédéric Malle and Kilian Paris, innovations and iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Jo Malone London and Le Labo Home products continue to flourish as consumer craved the sense to elevate the sanctuary of their homes. 
Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand [dot-com,] third-party platforms, pure players and retailer dot-com doors all contributed [meaningfully]. Our go-to-market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Cyber Week and Tmall 11/11 Global Shopping Festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention. We continue to enhance our brand sites with high-touch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping complete with useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice. 
Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented beauty adviser on a global scale. Virtual Try-On is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added Virtual Try-On to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as a big uptick in activity on brand side that had previously launched it. 
Video chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America, conversion of live chat session is nearly 4x higher than average conversion in the market. Video chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty adviser offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket size than average. 
Our brands are increasingly offering other engaging virtual services and experiences. Two examples are found on clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin [agnostic] tool instructs the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates. And Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with the brand expert consultants. 
We continue to force high-touch innovation online as evidenced by the Estée Lauder brand new AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we are piloting in North America. We anticipate that this dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Estée Lauder as well for other brands. 
We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites but also successfully driving repeat, enabled in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty program members who both rose strong double digits, driven by triple-digit growth of international loyalty program members. 
In so many ways, we are building deeper relationships with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for Tmall 11/11 Global Shopping Festival, leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 11/11, the Estée Lauder brand moved into the #1 rank in beauty. La Mer notched #1 rank in Luxury Beauty. Max was the #1 prestige makeup brand. And Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance. 
We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and have been investing in it for more than 2 decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investments, including accelerating our consumer-facing investment like Virtual Try-On, social selling, omnichannel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand. In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically and our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world. 
Among the regions, Asia Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement, with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China, prospered, while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China, momentum in brick and mortar carried into the quarter, with sales again growing double digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 11/11 event. Nearly every brand grew, as across the brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation, hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer and activations, as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. 
Travel retail grew single digits organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Hainan, as we fulfilled the desires of the traveling Chinese consumers with ideal merchandising. Traffic to Hainan continue to rebound. And duty-free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers sought to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver [owing pretail], which newly offered live streaming. 
Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skin care and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia Pacific region are abundant. Over the last 15 months despite the challenges of the pandemic, we made 3 significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean-based skin care brands Dr. Jart+, while in early 2020, we committed to build an end-to-end innovation center in Shanghai. 
Today, I'm pleased to confirm we are building a state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We are on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We are also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. 
We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will be enable (sic) us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering equipment, with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment. 
Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals, driven by focus on fewer, bigger and better hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already out are 2 in skincare.  The Estée Lauder brand launched Supreme+ Bright. It addresses the trend of brightening in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of all skin tones around the world with its Even Better skin tone and dark spot benefits, meeting top needs of the multi-ethnic consumers. Clinique introduced Moisture Surge 100 hour with an exclusive [aloe vera therman] that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also last 100 hours even after you wash your face. In makeup, Clinique launched Even Better Clinical Serum Foundation, a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours wear good-for-scale ingredients to help visibly improving skin instantly and over time. 
Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us and our key stakeholders, and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in climate, sustainable ingredients and packaging, and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We are pleased to have join CDP's 2020 Climate A List, having been awarded the highest score of A. 
In January, Aveda proudly announced that its products are vegan. As a mission-driven brand, this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmental impact while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends. 
Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products. The 2 new Clinique products, which I just described, are 2 such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package. 
To continue to invest in and advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advance and professional development of our Black talent. From [average chair] leadership development program, we'll ensure that our Black employees have the support and advocacy of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training mentorship and career development opportunities.
In closing, we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strengths of our multiple engines of growth strategy, hero products and robust innovation. We did this while living our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do: focusing on safety and well-being of our employees, making progress on our environmental goals, and acting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. 
I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the [world] ahead will still be challenging, together we can be optimistic the brighter days are coming. 
I wish each one of you good health. And now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call. And net sales growth numbers are in constant curr",1454,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and I certainly echo your comments regarding our wonderful employees. 
As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call. And net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. 
Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. Sales performed above our expectations, in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual Tmall 11/11 shopping festival, as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter, and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. 
Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower cost for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skin care also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. 
Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID-related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Lower selling costs and other in-store promotion costs also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick and mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. 
Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic door closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter, considering the record results achieved in the year-ago period. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized GILTI U.S. tax regulations. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. 
Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate, while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macro environment. 
Our plans under the post COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past 6 months, we have taken charges of $46 million, primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region, and in employee-related costs as we realign resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half, we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint, primarily in western markets. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our Glamglow brand, reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand's growth plans and lower-than-expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. 
During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased, reflecting timing-related items that also support our second half growth plans. And accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct-to-consumer business and a 5-day improvement in DSO. 
We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. 
We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation, and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and new variants are surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless, we had not assumed a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. 
So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of 6 months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+, which benefited our growth in the first half, adds 2 percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year. 
As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably, Lord & Taylor stage stores and [doors] are liquidating; and Macy's, Nordstrom and [Douglas] have announced door reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the lost sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full year sales, and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations and online. 
While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning costs include some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee costs, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year. As well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took, travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facilities continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asia manufacturing plant and innovation center. And as we continue to see signs of consumers' willingness to resume their normal activities, including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter, to strongly support our launch programs and to begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year.
Looking at the near term, for the third quarter, we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year, and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lapped the purchase of Dr. Jart+ at the beginning of our third quarter, and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20, reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology. And currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. 
We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out-of-home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we have proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macro environment while continuing to support our employees and our social and environmental commitments, and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Can you just talk about the sustainability of that strength in each of those areas as we move to a post COVID environment, as well as what some of your key strategies might be to maintain momentum post COVID? 
And then on the makeup side, that's obviously been a laggard area for obvious reasons. How quickly do you think category growth recovers in makeup post COVID? And what's your outlook there?"
207221,659845728,2194369,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia an",655,"Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia and particularly China is, in term of mix, one of the biggest builder of skin care. Because the penetration of skin care, the penetration or beauty for skin care in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skin care strength will continue after COVID. 
The other driver is China and the potential of China, as we explained very well in our Investor Day, is for the long term. The Chinese consumer, the demographic are right. The potential of the smaller cities, tier 3 and tier 4 cities, will continue to grow the power of online and the online distribution will continue to be very strong. 
In TR, imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated. And so this will be a further acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. 
So all our key drivers are really here for the long term. And most importantly as you know, our driver tend to be accretive in profitability, so that will create resources over time. 
The laggard is the brick and mortar, particularly in the west. Now this obviously in the short term, is an issue, because there is lack of traffic, and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity. But also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long term. And so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about 1/3 of our business is still in brick and mortar in the west. 
And so if you imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracey summarized which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores, which will not be sustainable in the long term; and our business acceleration program, which is really putting back -- rightsizing if you want all the channels for us, rebuilding productivity over time. 
And so the combination of traffic, closures and business acceleration program is our answer to, in the long term after COVID, being able to make also brick and mortar again an engine of growth, which will be profitable building the company for the long term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous strength post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers. And we are working to make also what is a drag in the short term rebuild as a positive long-term channel, which is the brick and mortar in the west.
In terms of makeup, it was last part of your question, our -- makeup is very much driven by user occasions; so user occasion meaning going to the office, going out for dinner, having a party, et cetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the [cost] recovery, and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the use education will go back into the life of people, the recovery will be fast and steep. And so we are ready for that. Now if -- when do we assume this will happen, frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey's plan is difficult to answer on when vaccination of the rest will have a full impact. But we believe that from what we see in the market starting the fall of 2021, we could see a beginning of certain user occasion to be reestablished. Because of this makeup growth, will follow back, in our opinion, starting from the [moment particularly]."

I was curious if we could talk a little bit about e-commerce development in Western Europe in particular. Because I think what's sort of hidden, if you will, in the numbers, and you worked through contribution from travel retail and so on, is that Western Europe, while still down of course, was down I think a lot less than has been the case thus far through the pandemic. You mentioned the Cyber Week and the shopping dynamic in Western Europe, but my sense is that, that is a channel that had been somewhat less developed historically. So I'd love to hear more about how that built up and thinking about kind of stickiness of that behavior going ahead, particularly in a quarter or 2 where there aren't big shopping events that are typical for that market."
207221,659845728,2194369,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Yes. So first of all, the online business has done very well this quarter, plus 60% globally. And it's interesting, we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel, brand.com, retail.com, third party",535,"Yes. So first of all, the online business has done very well this quarter, plus 60% globally. And it's interesting, we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel, brand.com, retail.com, third party platform, pure plays. And so Western Europe is the same as Western Europe is growing, depending by market, double-digit or triple-digit in online. And obviously, the holiday season has been because of the lockdown. As you know, in Western Europe particularly, COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick and mortar were closed. In countries like the U.K. as an example, December was a super difficult month. And so there was no regular Christmas holidays in brick and mortar, and obviously, U.K. was not the only place. And so because of this we were able to keep it to online in an extraordinary way. 
I think we -- our teams have done a magnificent work in taking care of our consumer online when they were because of prudent behavior for COVID, not going to the brick and mortar. And what we have seen that this works in many, many cases. Meaning at the end, the consumers -- certain categories were working because of repeat. Meaning the consumer didn't do without their preferred La Mer cream or their preferred [advanced retailer], whatever. And so we got a lot of selling by the online channel. But also that we are able to speak to their gifting habits, and we created gift opportunities and delivery model for gifting, et cetera. So there was a lot of creativity and invention in this area. 
Now this online, in general I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long term. And this acceleration will continue also post COVID. And one of the reasons for that, which is particularly true in Western Europe, is that the new online focus created -- brought online or then created new consumers, including more mature consumers. Online, particularly in Europe, was really dedicated to millennial younger consumers, while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they are liking it. They are becoming loyal. And so they will also post COVID have a bigger percentage of the shopping online than before. 
On top of this, if you think that we are adding high-touch services online, so what were the services that before were available in brick and mortar now gradually, but they are also available online. And we have been able to scale this at the speed of light. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today Virtual Try-On is already available in 90% of our brand comp sales in term of coverage. Imagine that, and that was -- it was not even close to that 6 months ago. 
And so the consumer responding to that, and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter 2 and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years."

But it's still declining, so it's not different than the rest of the world, China. Meaning skin care is very, very strong, fragrances are accelerating. 
And makeup is the laggard, even in China, however, on a completely different proportion. Because when you see -- when you think of the explanation I just gave before, that makeup is completely correlated to the occasion of usage in China. Because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are opened, people are shopping more regularly. Brick and mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions, makeup is in better shape, but still is the laggard between the categories. 
And mostly in China, I would say from our consumer understanding, is because of mask wearing. Meaning China is better control in COVID. But also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing, and mask wearing also is a reason for less usage of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world, still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID, where we assume there will be -- or expect, there will be a strong recovery of makeup also in China."

And again our point of view, this will be very sticky because the people are shopping online. And obviously, some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar we are closed, for sure in the case of luxury. But they are lacking it, and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us that they are enjoying the [spiels]. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better. And we have more loyalty program, as we discussed, and they are getting expanded. And the level of loyalty is going up; and the repurchase rate, meaning the coming back, is going up. 
Then we see conversions very strong at traffic increasing. And there are ways where the conversion will be driven and will be maintained after. 
The most important of the investment we are doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high-touch services transfer online: so the chat with the consultants, the Virtual Try-On, the live streaming opportunities. The use of our particular brand.com in this case also as media platform, because we see that the time that the consumers are spending online is increasing dramatically because when they have the Virtual Try-On service, the possibility to a consultant, they spend more time. And this time is time of exposure to all our equity messages. 
So this is media value. This is really media value. Meaning, we have more than 0.5 billion consumers coming on our site every year, more in this moment. And then imagine that they stay 9 minutes and they say -- if we had to buy media to speak to 0.5 billion consumer for 9 minutes, this will be a huge cost, while this in place is another benefit of our selling operations. 
So there is a lot of value in -- in these high-touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic, because people are coming not only to buy product before the services and will maintain or possibly further increase conversion after COVID And then finally, we'll increase the value of our online as media value. 
And so this is a very positive view for the long term. Obviously, we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick and mortar after COVID. There is no one consumer that is only online or only brick and mortar. I believe the consumer will love the omnichannel experience. By the way, after COVID they will be anxious to get again the brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back. 
And that's why we are building around this reality, this expectation, a much better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of purchase or time of experience online and how much they want in brick and mortar and they will navigate among the 2 channels in new ways. I believe the companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage."

So just curious what categories, what regions you're looking at for that? 
And then my question is really around the margin progression, especially given this quarter. I think that's the highest quarterly operating margin you've achieved as a public company. So realizing of course that there's a lot of normal expenditures that aren't happening right now, but as you think about second half, long term, are there things you've learned over the course of almost 12 months now on areas you can come back -- cut back on spend more permanently? Or are there areas where you have to just push even harder? 
And as you think about specifically for Q3, what's planned in Q3? Because while you're looking for margin expansion, it looks like it would only imply about similar to what you achieved in fiscal Q2, despite COVID obviously now entering the base."

Olivia, no, thanks for the question. So regarding our production capacity, as you've seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we are in -- have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skin care. And we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe. And as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skin care. And there will be some makeup, primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strongest demand growth is will be a real benefit to us, and we're looking -- we're certainly looking forward to that. 
As it relates to the margin, I mean I would -- as I said in my prepared remarks, Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling costs last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the following benefits and some of the other 
[Audio Gap] 
add back on, we controlled head count, T&E, et cetera. 
So in terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of I would say more discretionary costs as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control. But the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost-saving programs. That's where the permanent more sustainable cost takeout comes from. So the reason why you're seeing, if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs, given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course of have ended up closing, that those -- some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half, in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point."

Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick and mortar.

But certainly, Michael, everything that we are doing from a business management standpoint and from a cost management standpoint would get us in that north star of 20%."

So it seems like there's more and more friction coming out of that process, and a lot of square footage is going to be added there. 
Does Hainan Island change your travel retail business even after global economies reopen? Does it change your outlook on travel and the Chinese domestic consumer?"

No, this is -- as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general, and China domestic. In particular within China domestic, Hainan is the star. And it's driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities purchased because of the regulations that you just explained and by the development of retail. 
So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel, which is developing. Now when the normal travel will -- maybe it will never be normal, et cetera, but the new normal travel will be reinstated after COVID, and you add to this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia, and the Chinese consumer will go back travel in the world. And that's obviously the desire, one of the biggest aspiration if you talk to the consumer, look to the consumer opinions and research for the long term. So when there will be a combination of reinstated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make still one of the most important long-term channels of opportunity, full of opportunities. 
And again, the biggest opportunities remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into buyers and retail, so the possibility buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane and things like that. Those 2 elements are big drivers of the future of travel retail independently from the short-term management of the crisis. 
And in terms of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time, our Chinese business between quarter 1 and quarter 2 has basically doubled the level of growth, our China Mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerated, but not as strong as the China Mainland business, which was driven by amazing online events like 11/11 during the November period. 
And so the combination of the development of online within China, the fact that brick and mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter 2, was growing double digits, showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable. And then travel retail continues to do very well. And so when we look also to our total Chinese consumer consumption, bringing all together what is domestic travel retail and Mainland China, we still see an acceleration in total from quarter 1 to quarter 2. 
And so we believe this is a very, very strong potential. We are working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners, being able to do good business with us for the long term. And that's our goal, and we are working on it."

Let me first wish that each of you are in good health and that your families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. And our focus remains, first and foremost, on the health and safety of our employees, their families and our consumers.  
To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional well-being of colleagues, to making hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund and so much more. In December, the company made an additional donation to the employees' fund, and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments.  
Our employees' agility and creativity empowered the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3%, a 12-point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively, 10 brands grew led by the double-digit from Estée Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Frédéric Malle also rose double digits. We focused our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas, delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.  
In the quarter, we faced increasingly complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered results that exceeded our record second half quarter of fiscal year 2020, when sales grew the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with agility in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online.  
Our skin care category performed extraordinarily. Its accelerating growth reflected the strong and locally relevant innovation, successful hero strategies, compelling ingredient narratives and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high-repeat hero products was broad-based across our categories from cleansers to watery lotions, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to go from strength to strength, bolstered by the piece of mind of the ritual of skin care as an expression of self-care.  
From entry prestige through luxury, our brands excelled in skin care. Many brands contributed, demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart+ provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth with its appealing derma brand positioning. The Estée Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of its hero franchises in skin care. Its new advanced night repair serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula and luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to advanced night repair eye. And these 2 hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets.  
The brand's revitalizing supreme franchise accelerated significantly. Gaining momentum with its hero moisturizer. La Mer, leadership in luxury skin care grew as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven efficacy [ sort ]. Here, 2 serum was a vibrant subcategory. Its new The Concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying strengths of heroes like Crème de la Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genaissance de la Mer Concentrated Night Balm performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs.  
Clinique returned to growth, lifted by skin care, as its hero franchises that are focused on hard-to-solve skin care problems like acne and dark spot [ thrived ]. Even Better Clinical Interrupter is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complemented by an acceleration in the brand's 3-Step product and acne solution lines.  
Our luxury and artisanal fragrances captivated consumer desires. For Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Frédéric Malle and Kilian Paris, innovations and iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Jo Malone London and Le Labo home products continue to flourish as consumer craved the sense to elevate the sanctuary of their homes.  
Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand.com, third-party platforms, pure players and retailer.com doors all contributed [ meaningfully ]. Our go-to-market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Cyber Week and Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention.  
We continue to enhance our brand sites with high-touch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping complete with useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice.  
Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented beauty adviser on a global scale. Virtual Try-On is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added Virtual Try-On to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as a big uptick in activity on brand sites that had previously launched it.  
Video chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America, conversion of live chat session is nearly 4x higher than average conversion in the market. Video chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty adviser offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket size than average. 
Our brands are increasingly offering other engaging virtual services and experiences. Two examples are found on clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin diagnostic tool instructs the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates. And Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with the brand expert consultants.  
We continue to pursue high-touch innovation online as evidenced by the Estée Lauder brand new AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we are piloting in North America. We anticipate that this dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Estée Lauder as well for other brands.  
We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites but also successfully driving repeat, enabled in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty program members who both rose strong double digits, driven by triple-digit growth of international loyalty program members. In so many ways, we are building deeper relationships with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 11.11, the Estée Lauder brand moved into the #1 rank in beauty. La Mer notched #1 rank in luxury beauty. M.A.C was the #1 prestige makeup brand. And Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance.  
We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and have been investing in it for more than 2 decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investments, including accelerating our consumer-facing investment like Virtual Try-On, social selling, omnichannel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand.  
In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically and our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world.  
Among the regions, Asia Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement, with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China, prospered, while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China, momentum in brick and mortar carried into the quarter, with sales again growing double digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 11.11 event. Nearly every brand grew, as across the brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation, hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer and activations as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. Travel retail grew single digits organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Hainan, as we fulfilled the desires of the traveling Chinese consumers with ideal merchandising. Traffic to Hainan continue to rebound, And the duty-free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers sought to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver [indiscernible], which newly offered live streaming.  
Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skin care and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia Pacific region are abundant. Over the last 15 months despite the challenges of the pandemic, we made 3 significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean-based skin care brands Dr. Jart+, while in early 2020, we committed to build an end-to-end innovation center in Shanghai.  
Today, I'm pleased to confirm we are building a state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We are on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We are also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will be enabled us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering equipment, with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment.  
Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals, driven by focus on fewer, bigger and better hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already out are 2 in skincare. 
The Estée Lauder brand launched Supreme+ Bright. It addresses the trend of brightening in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of all skin tones around the world with its Even Better Skin Tone and dark spot benefits, meeting top needs of the multi-ethnic consumers. Clinique introduced Moisture Surge 100-Hour with an exclusive aloe vera bio-ferment that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also last 100 hours even after you wash your face. In makeup, Clinique launched Even Better Clinical Serum Foundation, a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours wear and good for skin ingredients to help visibly improving skin instantly and over time.  
Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us and our key stakeholders, and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in climate, sustainable ingredients and packaging, and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We are pleased to have join CDP's 2020 Climate A List, having been awarded the highest score of A.  
In January, Aveda proudly announced that its products are vegan. As a mission-driven brand, this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmental impact while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends.  
Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products. The 2 new Clinique products, which I just described, are 2 such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package.  
To continue to invest in and advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advanced and professional development of our Black talent. From [ every chair ] leadership development program, we'll ensure that our Black employees have the support and advocacy of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training mentorship and career development opportunities. 
In closing, we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strengths of our multiple engines of growth strategy, hero products and robust innovation. We did this while living our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do: focusing on safety and well-being of our employees, making progress on our environmental goals, and acting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. 
I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the [ role ] ahead will still be challenging, together we can be optimistic the brighter days are coming. 
I wish each one of you good health. And now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call.

As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call. And net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. 
Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. Sales performed above our expectations, in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual Tmall 11.11 Shopping Festival, as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter, and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. 
Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower cost for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skin care also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. 
Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID-related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Lower selling costs and other in-store promotion costs also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick and mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. 
Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic door closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter, considering the record results achieved in the year-ago period. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized GILTI U.S. tax regulations. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. 
Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate, while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macro environment. 
Our plans under the post COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past 6 months, we have taken charges of $46 million, primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region, and in employee-related costs as we realign resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half, we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint, primarily in western markets. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our Glamglow brand, reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand's growth plans and lower-than-expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. 
During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased, reflecting timing-related items that also support our second half growth plans. And accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct-to-consumer business and a 5-day improvement in DSO. 
We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. 
We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation, and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and new variants are surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless, we had not assumed a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. 
So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of 6 months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+, which benefited our growth in the first half, adds 2 percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year. 
As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably, Lord & Taylor, Stage Stores and Debenhams are liquidating; and Macy's, Nordstrom and [ Douglas ] have announced door reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the lost sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full year sales, and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations and online. 
While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning costs include some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee costs, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year. As well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took, travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facilities continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asian manufacturing plant and innovation center. And as we continue to see signs of consumers' willingness to resume their normal activities, including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter, to strongly support our launch programs and to begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year.
Looking at the near term, for the third quarter, we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year, and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lapped the purchase of Dr. Jart+ at the beginning of our third quarter, and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20, reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology. And currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. 
We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out-of-home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we have proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macro environment while continuing to support our employees, our social and environmental commitments, and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Can you just talk about the sustainability of that strength in each of those areas as we move to a post COVID environment, as well as what some of your key strategies might be to maintain momentum post COVID? 
And then on the makeup side, that's obviously been a laggard area for obvious reasons. How quickly do you think category growth recovers in makeup post COVID? And what's your outlook there?"
207221,659845728,2194443,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia an",663,"Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia and particularly China is, in term of mix, one of the biggest builder of skin care. Because the penetration of skin care, the penetration of beauty in -- for skin care in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skin care strength will continue after COVID. 
The other driver is China and the potential of China, as we explained very well in our Investor Day is for the long term. The Chinese -- the demographics are right. The potential of the smaller cities, tier 3 and tier 4 cities, will continue to grow the power of online and the online distribution will continue to be very strong. 
In TR, imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated. And so this will be a further acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. 
So all our key drivers are really here for the long term. And most importantly as you know, our drivers tend to be accretive in profitability, so that will create resources over time. 
The laggard is the brick and mortar, particularly in the west. Now this obviously in the short term, is an issue, because there is lack of traffic, and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity. But also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long term. And so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about 1/3 of our business is still in brick and mortar in the west. 
And so if you imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracey summarized which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores, which will not be sustainable in the long term; and our business acceleration program, which is really putting back -- rightsizing if you want, all the channels for us, rebuilding productivity over time. 
And so the combination of traffic, closures and business acceleration program is our answer to, in the long term after COVID, being able to make also brick and mortar again an engine of growth, which will be profitable building the company for the long term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous strength post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers. And we are working to make also what is a drag in the short term rebuild as a positive long-term channel, which is the brick and mortar in the west.
In terms of makeup, it was last part of your question, our -- makeup is very much driven by used at occasions; so used at occasion meaning going to the office, going out for dinner, having a party, et cetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the post recovery, and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the used at occassion will go back into the life of people, the recovery will be fast and steep. And so we are ready for that. Now if -- when do we assume this will happen, frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey's plan is difficult to answer on when vaccination of the rest will have a full impact. But we believe that from what we see in the market starting the fall of 2021, we could see a beginning of certain used at occasion to be reestablished. Because of this makeup growth, will follow back, in our opinion, starting from the [ moment particularly ]."

You mentioned the Cyber Week and the shopping dynamic in Western Europe, but my sense is that, that is a channel that had been somewhat less developed historically. So I'd love to hear more about how that built up and thinking about kind of stickiness of that behavior going ahead, particularly in a quarter or 2 where there aren't big shopping events that are typical for that market."

And so Western Europe is the same as Western Europe is growing, depending by market, double-digit or triple-digit in online. And obviously, the holiday season has been because of the lockdown, as you know, in Western Europe particularly, COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick and mortar were closed. In countries like the U.K. as an example, December was a super difficult month. And so there was no regular Christmas holidays in brick and mortar, and obviously, U.K. was not the only place. And so because of this we were able to pivot to online in an extraordinary way. 
I think we -- our teams have done a magnificent work in taking care of our consumer online when they were because of prudent behavior for COVID, not going to the brick and mortar. And what we have seen that this works in many, many cases. Meaning, at the end, the consumers -- certain categories were working because of repeat. Meaning the consumer didn't do without their preferred La Mer cream or their preferred advanced night repair, whatever. And so we got a lot of selling via the online channel. But also that we are able to speak to their gifting habits, and we created gifting opportunities and delivery model for gifting, et cetera. So there was a lot of creativity and invention in this area. 
Now this online, in general I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long term. And this acceleration will continue also post COVID. And one of the reasons for that, which is particularly true in Western Europe, is that the new online focus created -- brought online or then created new consumers, including more mature consumers. Online, particularly in Europe, was really dedicated to millennial and younger consumers, while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they are liking it. And they are becoming loyal. And so they will also post COVID have a bigger percentage of the shopping online than before. 
On top of this, if you think that we are adding high-touch services online, so what were the services that before were available in brick and mortar now gradually, but they are also available online. And we have been able to scale this at the speed of light. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today Virtual Try-On is already available in 90% of our brand comp sales in term of coverage. Imagine that, and that was -- it was not even close to that 6 months ago. 
And so the consumer responding to that, and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter 2 and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years."

But it's still declining, so it's not different than the rest of the world, China. Meaning skin care is very, very strong, fragrances are accelerating. 
And makeup is the laggard, even in China, however, on a completely different proportion. Because when you see -- when you think of the explanation I just gave before, that makeup is completely correlated to the occasion of usage in China. Because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are opened, people are shopping more regularly. Brick and mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions, makeup is in better shape, but still is the laggard between the categories. 
And mostly in China, I would say from our consumer understanding, is because of mask wearing. Meaning China is better controlling COVID. But also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing, and mask wearing also is a reason for less usage of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world, but still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID, where we assume there will be -- or expect, there will be a strong recovery of makeup also in China."

And again our point of view, this will be very sticky because the people are shopping online. And obviously, some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar we are closed, for sure in the case of luxury. But they are lacking it, and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us that they are enjoying [ this still ]. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better. And we have more loyalty program, as we discussed, and they are getting expanded. And the level of loyalty is going up; and the repurchase rate, meaning the coming back, is going up. 
Then we see conversions very strong and traffic increasing. And there are ways where the conversion will be driven and will be maintained after. 
The most important of the investment we are doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high-touch services transfer online: so the chat with the consultants, the Virtual Try-On, the live streaming opportunities. The use of our particularly brand.com in this case also as media platform, because we see that the time that the consumers are spending online is increasing dramatically because when they have the Virtual Try-On service, the possibility to consult, they spend more time. And this time is time of exposure to all our equity messages. 
So this is media value. This is really media value. Meaning, we have more than 0.5 billion consumers coming on our site every year, more in this moment. And then imagine that they stay 9 minutes and they say -- if we had to buy media to speak to 0.5 billion consumer for 9 minutes, this will be a huge cost, while this in place is another benefit of our selling operations. 
So there is a lot of value in -- in these high-touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic, because people are coming not only to buy product before the services and will maintain or possibly further increase conversion after COVID. And then finally, we'll increase the value of our online as media value. 
And so this is a very positive view for the long term. Obviously, we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick and mortar after COVID. There is no one consumer that is only online or only brick and mortar. I believe the consumer will love the omnichannel experience. By the way, after COVID they will be anxious to get again the brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back. 
And that's why we are building around this reality, this expectation, a much better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of purchase or time of experience online and how much they want in brick and mortar and they will navigate among the 2 channels in new ways. I believe the companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage."

So just curious what categories, what regions you're looking at for that? 
And then my question is really around the margin progression, especially given this quarter. I think that's the highest quarterly operating margin you've achieved as a public company. So realizing of course that there's a lot of normal expenditures that aren't happening right now, but as you think about second half, long term, are there things you've learned over the course of almost 12 months now on areas you can come back -- cut back on spend more permanently? Or are there areas where you have to just push even harder? 
And as you think about specifically for Q3, what's planned in Q3? Because while you're looking for margin expansion, it looks like it would only imply about similar to what you achieved in fiscal Q2, despite COVID obviously now entering the base."

Olivia, no, thanks for the question. So regarding our production capacity, as you've seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we are in -- have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skin care. And we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe. And as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skin care. And there will be some makeup, primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strongest demand growth is will be a real benefit to us, and we're looking -- we're certainly looking forward to that. 
As it relates to the margin, I mean I would -- as I said in my prepared remarks, Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling costs last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the furloughing benefits and some of the other [indiscernible] back on, we control head count, T&E, et cetera. 
So in terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of I would say more discretionary costs as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control. But the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost-saving programs. That's where the permanent more sustainable cost takeout comes from. So that's the reason why you're seeing, if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs, given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course [indiscernible] half ended up closing, that those -- some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half, in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point."

Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick and mortar.

So it seems like there's more and more friction coming out of that process, and a lot of square footage is going to be added there. 
Does Hainan Island change your travel retail business even after global economies reopen? Does it change your outlook on travel and the Chinese domestic consumer?"

No, this is -- as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general, and China domestic. In particular within China domestic, Hainan is the star. And it's driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities purchased because of the regulations that you just explained and by the development of retail. 
So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel, which is developing. Now when the normal travel will -- maybe it will never be normal, et cetera, but the new normal travel will be reinstated after COVID, and you add to this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia, and the Chinese consumer will go back traveling the world. And that's obviously the desire, one of the biggest aspiration if you talk to the consumer, look to the consumer opinions and research for the long term. So when there will be a combination of reinstated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make TR still one of the most important long-term channels of opportunity, full of opportunities. 
And again, the biggest opportunities remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into buyers and retail, so the possibility of buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane and things like that. Those 2 elements are big drivers of the future of travel retail independently from the short-term management of the crisis. 
And in terms of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time, our Chinese business between quarter 1 and quarter 2 has basically doubled the level of growth, our China Mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerated, but not as strong as the China Mainland business, which was driven by amazing online events like 11.11 during the November period. 
And so the combination of the development of online within China, the fact that brick and mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter 2, was growing double digits, showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable. And then travel retail continues to do very well. And so when we look also to our total Chinese consumer consumption, bringing all together what is domestic travel retail and mainland China, we still see an acceleration in total from quarter 1 to quarter 2. And so we believe this is a very, very strong potential. We are working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners, being able to do good business with us for the long term. And that's our goal, and we are working on it."

They are brand.com, retail.com, pure-play and third-party platform, which we define that is the Tmall model. And so these channels have different level of developments by countries, and this is the results of consumer preferences and historical development of the channel. So it's not that we are driving -- we are driving all of them. And particularly, we work with our retail partners very closely to drive their retail.com, which is most of the times doing very well, particularly in this period, but also for the long term. So for example, in China, retail.com is very limited. And while brand.com, and most importantly third-party platform model is the most developed. While in the U.S. retail.com is very, very strong. And we see a lot of great developments recently in the retail.com of our key partners. 
And this also serves in this moment as a mitigating factor to the brick-and-mortar issues or productivity that we have discussed before. So we will continue to develop each one of these channels. And it's the consumer deciding where to go. And obviously, we partner with each one of our retail partners to do the best possible job in every channel."

Let me first wish that each of you are in good health and that your families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19.

To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional well-being of colleagues to making hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund and so much more. In December, the company made an additional donation to the employees' fund, and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments. 
Our employees' agility and creativity empowered the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3%, a 12-point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively, 10 brands grew, led by the double-digit growth from Estée Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Frédéric Malle also rose double digits. We focused our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas, delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. 
In the quarter, we faced increasingly complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered results that exceeded our record second half quarter of fiscal year 2020, when sales grew the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with agility in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online. 
Our skin care category performed extraordinarily. Its accelerating growth reflected the strong and locally relevant innovation, successful hero strategies, compelling ingredient narratives and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high-repeat hero products was broad-based across our categories from cleansers to watery lotions, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to go from strength to strength, bolstered by the peace of mind of the ritual of skin care as an expression of self-care. 
From entry prestige through luxury, our brands excelled in skin care. Many brands contributed, demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart+ provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth with its appealing derma brand positioning. The Estée Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of its hero franchises in skin care. Its new advanced night repair serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula and luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to advanced night repair eye. And these 2 hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets. 
The brand's Revitalizing Supreme+ franchise accelerated significantly, gaining momentum with its hero moisturizer. La Mer leadership in luxury skin care grew as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven efficacy [ sort ]. Here, 2 serum was a vibrant subcategory. Its new The Concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying strengths of heroes like Crème de la Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genaissance de la Mer Concentrated Night Balm performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs. 
Clinique returned to growth, lifted by skin care, as its hero franchises that are focused on hard-to-solve skin care problems like acne and dark spot thrived. Even Better Clinical Interrupter is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complemented by an acceleration in the brand's 3-Step product and Acne Solution (sic) [ Acne Solutions ] lines. 
Our luxury and artisanal fragrances captivated consumer desires. For Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Frédéric Malle and Kilian Paris, innovations and iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Jo Malone London and Le Labo home products continue to flourish as consumer craved the scents to elevate the sanctuary of their homes. 
Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand.com, third-party platforms, pure players and retailer.com doors all contributed meaningfully. Our go-to-market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Cyber Week and Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention. 
We continue to enhance our brand sites with high-touch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping complete with useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice. 
Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented beauty adviser on a global scale. Virtual Try-On is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added Virtual Try-On to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as a big up-stick in activity on brand sites that had previously launched it. 
Video chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America, conversion of live chat session is nearly 4x higher than average conversion in the market. Video chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty advisor offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket size than average. 
Our brands are increasingly offering other engaging virtual services and experiences. Two examples are found on clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin diagnostic tool, instructs the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates. And Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with the brand expert consultants. 
We continue to pursue high-touch innovation online as evidenced by the Estée Lauder brand new AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we are piloting in North America. We anticipate that this dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Estée Lauder as well for other brands. 
We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites but also successfully driving repeat, enabled in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty program members who -- both rose strong double digits, driven by triple-digit growth of international loyalty program members. In so many ways, we are building deeper relationships with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 11.11, the Estée Lauder brand moved into the #1 rank in beauty. La Mer notched #1 rank in luxury beauty. M.A.C was the #1 prestige makeup brand. And Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance. 
We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and have been investing in it for more than 2 decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investments, including accelerating our consumer-facing investment like Virtual Try-On, social selling, omnichannel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand. 
In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically and our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world. 
Among the regions, Asia Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement, with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China prospered, while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China, momentum in brick and mortar carried into the quarter, with sales again growing double digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 11.11 event. Nearly every brand grew, as across the brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation, hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer and activations as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. Travel retail grew single digits organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Hainan, as we fulfilled the desires of the traveling Chinese consumers with ideal merchandising. Traffic to Hainan continue to rebound. And the duty-free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers sought to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver owing prepaid, which newly offered live streaming. 
Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skin care and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia Pacific region are abundant. Over the last 15 months despite the challenges of the pandemic, we made 3 significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean-based skin care brands Dr. Jart+, while in early 2020, we committed to build an end-to-end innovation center in Shanghai. 
Today, I'm pleased to confirm we are building a state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We are on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We are also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will be enabled us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering equipment with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment. 
Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals, driven by focus on fewer, bigger and better hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already out are 2 in skincare. 
The Estée Lauder brand launched Supreme+ Bright. It addresses the trend of brightening in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of all skin tones around the world with its Even Better Skin Tone and dark spot benefits, meeting top needs of the multi-ethnic consumers. Clinique introduced Moisture Surge 100-Hour with an exclusive aloe vera bio-ferment that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also last 100 hours even after you wash your face. In makeup, Clinique launched Even Better Clinical Serum Foundation, a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours wear and good-for-skin ingredients to help visibly improving skin instantly and over time. 
Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us and our key stakeholders, and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in climate, sustainable ingredients and packaging, and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We are pleased to have join CDP's 2020 Climate A List, having been awarded the highest score of A. 
In January, Aveda proudly announced that its products are vegan. As a mission-driven brand, this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmental impact while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends. 
Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products. The 2 new Clinique products, which I just described, are 2 such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package. 
To continue to invest in and advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advanced and professional development of our Black talent. From every chair leadership development program, we'll ensure that our Black employees have the support and advocacy of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training, mentorship and career development opportunities. 
In closing, we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strengths of our multiple engines of growth strategy, hero products and robust innovation. We did this while living our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do: focusing on safety and well-being of our employees, making progress on our environmental goals, and acting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. 
I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the road ahead will still be challenging, together we can be optimistic the brighter days are coming.
I wish each one of you good health. And now I will turn the call over to Tracey."

As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call. And net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. 
Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. 
Sales performed above our expectations, in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual Tmall 11.11 Shopping Festival, as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter, and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. 
Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower cost for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skin care also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. 
Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID-related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Lower selling costs and other in-store promotion costs also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick and mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. 
Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic door closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter, considering the record results achieved in the year-ago period. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized GILTI U.S. tax regulations. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. 
Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate, while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macro environment. 
Our plans under the post COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past 6 months, we have taken charges of $46 million, primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region, and in employee-related costs as we realign resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half, we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint, primarily in western markets. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our GLAMGLOW brand, reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand's growth plans and lower-than-expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. 
During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased, reflecting timing-related items that also support our second half growth plans. And accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct-to-consumer business and a 5-day improvement in DSO. 
We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. 
We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation, and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and new variants are surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless, we had not assumed a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. 
So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of 6 months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+, which benefited our growth in the first half, adds 2 percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year.
As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably, Lord & Taylor, Stage Stores and Debenhams are liquidating; and Macy's, Nordstrom and Douglas have announced door reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the lost sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full year sales, and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations and online. 
While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning costs include some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee costs, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year. As well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took, travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. 
Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facilities continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asian manufacturing plant and innovation center. And as we continue to see signs of consumers' willingness to resume their normal activities, including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally, as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter, to strongly support our launch programs and to begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year.
Looking at the near term, for the third quarter, we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year, and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lapped the purchase of Dr. Jart+ at the beginning of our third quarter, and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20, reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology. And currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. 
We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out-of-home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we have proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macro environment while continuing to support our employees, our social and environmental commitments, and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

And then on the makeup side, that's obviously been a laggard area for obvious reasons. How quickly do you think category growth recovers in makeup post COVID? And what's your outlook there?"

So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia an",661,"Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us, let's go one by one. Skin care, very sustainable, the consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation for the future years. And the strength of Asia and particularly China is, in term of mix, one of the biggest builder of skin care. Because the penetration of skin care, the penetration of beauty in -- for skin care in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skin care strength will continue after COVID. 
The other driver is China and the potential of China, as we explained very well in our Investor Day, is for the long term. The Chinese -- the demographics are right. The potential of the smaller cities, tier 3 and tier 4 cities, will continue to grow the power of online and the online distribution will continue to be very strong. 
In TR, imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated. And so this will be a further acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. 
So all our key drivers are really here for the long term. And most importantly, as you know, our drivers tend to be accretive in profitability, so that will create resources over time. 
The laggard is the brick and mortar, particularly in the west. Now this obviously, in the short term, is an issue, because there is lack of traffic, and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity. But also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long term. And so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about 1/3 of our business is still in brick and mortar in the west. 
And so if you imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracey summarized which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores, which will not be sustainable in the long term; and our business acceleration program, which is really putting back -- rightsizing if you want, all the channels for us, rebuilding productivity over time. 
And so the combination of traffic, closures and business acceleration program is our answer to, in the long term after COVID, being able to make also brick and mortar again an engine of growth, which will be profitable building the company for the long term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous strength post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers. And we are working to make also what is a drag in the short term rebuild as a positive long-term channel, which is the brick and mortar in the west.
In terms of makeup, it was last part of your question, our -- makeup is very much driven by use at occasions; so use at occasion meaning going to the office, going out for dinner, having a party, et cetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the post recovery, and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the use at occasion will go back into the life of people, the recovery will be fast and steep. And so we are ready for that. Now if -- when do we assume this will happen? Frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey's plan is difficult to answer on when vaccination of the rest will have a full impact. But we believe that from what we see in the market starting the fall of 2021, we could see a beginning of certain use at occasion to be reestablished. Because of this, makeup growth, will follow back, in our opinion, starting from the moment particularly."

You mentioned the Cyber Week and the shopping dynamic in Western Europe, but my sense is that, that is a channel that had been somewhat less developed historically. So I'd love to hear more about how that built up and thinking about kind of stickiness of that behavior going ahead, particularly in a quarter or 2 where there aren't big shopping events that are typical for that market."

So first of all, the online business has done very well this quarter, plus 60% globally. And it's interesting, we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel, brand.com, retail.com, third party",536,"Yes. So first of all, the online business has done very well this quarter, plus 60% globally. And it's interesting, we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel, brand.com, retail.com, third party platform, pure plays. And so Western Europe is the same as Western Europe is growing, depending by market, double-digit or triple-digit in online. And obviously, the holiday season has been, because of the lockdown, as you know, in Western Europe particularly, COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick and mortar were closed. In countries like the U.K. as an example, December was a super difficult month. And so there was no regular Christmas holidays in brick and mortar, and obviously, U.K. was not the only place. And so because of this, we were able to pivot to online in an extraordinary way. 
I think we -- our teams have done a magnificent work in taking care of our consumer online when they were, because of prudent behavior for COVID, not going to the brick and mortar. And what we have seen that this works in many, many cases. Meaning, at the end, the consumers -- certain categories were working because of repeat. Meaning the consumer didn't do without their preferred La Mer cream or their preferred Advanced Night Repair, whatever. And so we got a lot of selling via the online channel. But also that we are able to speak to their gifting habits, and we created gifting opportunities and delivery model for gifting, et cetera. So there was a lot of creativity and invention in this area. 
Now this online, in general I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long term. And this acceleration will continue also post COVID. And one of the reasons for that, which is particularly true in Western Europe, is that the new online focus created -- brought online or then created new consumers, including more mature consumers. Online, particularly in Europe, was really dedicated to millennial and younger consumers, while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they are liking it. And they are becoming loyal. And so they will also post-COVID have a bigger percentage of the shopping online than before. 
On top of this, if you think that we are adding high-touch services online, so what were the services that before were available in brick and mortar now gradually, but they are also available online. And we have been able to scale this at the speed of light. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today Virtual Try-On is already available in 90% of our brand comp sales in term of coverage. Imagine that, and that was -- it was not even close to that 6 months ago. 
And so the consumer responding to that, and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter 2 and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years."

And this could be a driver of future acceleration or recovery in North America as well. Importantly to underline, these 2 opportunities are both brick and mortar and online. And so obviously, it will be very important also to -- being able to manage the online part of that opportunity.
In terms of the portfolio of brands, we continuously look at our portfolio. We look at our portfolio for efficiency.

But it's still declining, so is not different than the rest of the world, China. Meaning skin care is very, very strong, fragrances are accelerating and makeup is the laggard, even in China, however, on a completely different proportion. Because when you see -- when you think of the explanation I just gave before, that makeup is completely correlated to the occasion of usage in China, because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are opened, people are shopping more regularly. Brick and mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions, makeup is in better shape, but still is the laggard between the categories. 
And mostly in China, I would say from our consumer understanding, is because of mask wearing. Meaning China is better controlling COVID. But also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing, and mask wearing also is a reason for less usage of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world, but still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID, where we assume there will be -- or expect, there will be a strong recovery of makeup also in China."

No, it's a very good question. And again our point of view, this will be very sticky because the people are shopping online.

And again our point of view, this will be very sticky because the people are shopping online. And obviously, some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar were closed, for sure in the case of luxury. But they are lacking it, and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us that they are enjoying this still. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better. And we have more loyalty program, as we discussed, and they are getting expanded. And the level of loyalty is going up; and the repurchase rate, meaning the coming back, is going up. 
Then we see conversions very strong and traffic increasing. And there are ways where the conversion will be driven and will be maintained after. 
The most important of the investment we are doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high-touch services transfer online: so the chat with the consultants, the Virtual Try-On, the live streaming opportunities. The use of our -- particularly the brand.com in this case also as media platform, because we see that the time that the consumers are spending online is increasing dramatically because when they have the Virtual Try-On service, the possibility to consult, they spend more time. And this time is time of exposure to all our equity messages. 
So this is media value. This is really media value. Meaning, we have more than 0.5 billion consumers coming on our site every year, more in this moment. And then imagine that they stay 9 minutes and they say -- if we had to buy media to speak to 0.5 billion consumer for 9 minutes, this will be a huge cost, while this in place is another benefit of our selling operations. 
So there is a lot of value in -- in these high-touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic, because people are coming not only to buy product before the services and will maintain or possibly further increase conversion after COVID. And then finally, we'll increase the value of our online as media value. 
And so this is a very positive view for the long term. Obviously, we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick and mortar after COVID. There is no one consumer that is only online or only brick and mortar. I believe the consumer will love the omnichannel experience. By the way, after COVID they will be anxious to get again the brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back. 
And that's why we are building around this reality, this expectation, a much better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of purchase or time of experience online and how much they want in brick and mortar and they will navigate among the 2 channels in new ways. I believe the companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage."

So just curious what categories, what regions you're looking at for that? 
And then my question is really around the margin progression, especially given this quarter. I think that's the highest quarterly operating margin you've achieved as a public company. So realizing of course that there's a lot of normal expenditures that aren't happening right now, but as you think about second half, long term, are there things you've learned over the course of almost 12 months now on areas you can come back -- cut back on spend more permanently? Or are there areas where you have to just push even harder? 
And as you think about specifically for Q3, what's planned in Q3? Because while you're looking for margin expansion, it looks like it would only imply about similar to what you achieved in fiscal Q2, despite COVID obviously now entering the base."

Olivia, no, thanks for the question. So regarding our production capacity, as you've seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we are in -- have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skin care. And we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe. And as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skin care. And there will be some makeup, primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strongest demand growth is will be a real benefit to us, and we're looking -- we're certainly looking forward to that. 
As it relates to the margin, I mean I would -- as I said in my prepared remarks, Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling costs last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the furloughing benefits and some of the other [indiscernible] back on, we controlled head count, T&E, et cetera. 
So in terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of, I would say, more discretionary costs as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control. But the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost-saving programs. That's where the permanent, more sustainable cost takeout comes from. So that's the reason why you're seeing, if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs, given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course of the [ second ] half ended up closing, that those -- some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half, in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point."

And the margins will improve on makeup as well. 
Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick and mortar. So it is a category that is particularly challenged from a margin standpoint in this particular environment. But certainly, Michael, everything that we are doing from a business management standpoint and from a cost management standpoint would get us in that north star of 20%."

So it seems like there's more and more friction coming out of that process, and a lot of square footage is going to be added there. Does Hainan Island change your travel retail business even after global economies reopen? Does it change your outlook on travel and the Chinese domestic consumer?"

No, this is -- as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general, and China domestic. In particular within China domestic, Hainan is the star. And it's driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities purchased because of the regulations that you just explained and by the development of retail. 
So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel, which is developing. Now when the normal travel will -- maybe it will never be normal, et cetera, but the new normal travel will be reinstated after COVID, and you add to this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia, and the Chinese consumer will go back traveling the world. And that's obviously the desire, one of the biggest aspiration if you talk to the consumer, look to the consumer opinions and research for the long term. So when there will be a combination of reinstated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make TR still one of the most important long-term channels of opportunity, full of opportunities. 
And again, the biggest opportunities remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into buyers and retail, so the possibility of buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane and things like that. Those 2 elements are big drivers of the future of travel retail independently from the short-term management of the crisis. 
And in terms of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time, our Chinese business between quarter 1 and quarter 2 has basically doubled the level of growth, our China Mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerated, but not as strong as the China Mainland business, which was driven by amazing online events like 11.11 during the November period. 
And so the combination of the development of online within China, the fact that brick and mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter 2, was growing double digits, showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable. And then travel retails continues to do very well. And so when we look also to our total Chinese consumer consumption, bringing all together what is domestic travel retail and mainland China, we still see an acceleration in total from quarter 1 to quarter 2. And so we believe this is a very, very strong potential. We are working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners being able to do good business with us for the long term. That's our goal, and we are working on it."

It's a pleasure to speak with you today, and I hope that you and your families are in good health. Our hearts are with those impacted by COVID-19, particularly in places like India and Brazil that are experiencing severe resurgences. We remain committed to doing what we can to support our employees and these communities. 
Our third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 marks the continuation of strong sequential sales growth improvements, despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. We exceeded our sales and earning growth expectation even as several markets experienced increasing COVID-19 pressure throughout the quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy drove our success, empowered by the exceptional creativity and passion of our employees. 
We achieved these outstanding results while acting on our values. First and foremost, we continue to invest in employees and consumer safety and well-being during the health crisis. We expanded our work for the environment, from setting innovative new sustainability goals in travel retail, to seeing a wide farm -- wind farm in Oklahoma become fully operational, which is our largest renewable energy contract to date, and a project we were proud to support. We mad progress on our racial equity commitments and also outlined a new set of commitments for women advance and gender equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increased representation of women from underrepresented groups. 
In March, we launched our new equity and engagement center of excellence to drive greater equity representation within our business and across the value chain. We also launched a partnership with Howard University to support the success of its alumna through our experiential learning, career coaching, professional training and mentorship opportunities. 
While there was joy in this progress, there was also sorrow. We stood with our employees, consumers and partners in denouncing the rise in act of violence, hate and discrimination against the Asia and Pacific Islander community, and committed to donate to organization that support justice and equal treatment from Asian community in the United States. We keep our employees and communities top of mind through these challenging times.
With that as our guiding principle, let me turn back to financial results. Constant currency sales rose 13%, representing a sequential acceleration of organic sales growth improvement. We delivered a strong performance despite increased COVID-19 hardship in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America during the quarter. Estée Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty led the impressive performance of many brands. 
Skin care and fragrance once again delivered superior sales growth, although they had the toughest comparison to the year-ago period. In fact, our skin care category was nearly 30% larger on a reported basis this quarter than it was 2 years ago, owing to innovation in our powerful hero franchises, strength across multiple subcategories and the addition of Dr. Jart+, but before the future inclusion of this. 
And our fragrance category was 16% bigger than it was in fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, driven by our strategic focus on the luxury and artisanal segments. Both of these categories now have even greater scale to capture prestige beauty share as the recovery unfolds. 
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we focused our investment decisions on engines of growth and employed cost discipline in other areas, resulting in a near doubling of adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year period. While the complexities of the pandemic are ever present, adjusted operating margin nonetheless exceeded that of the third quarter of fiscal year '19, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 5% higher. 
Throughout the pandemic, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the long term as we successfully navigate the short term. We continue to strategically invest to drive sustainable growth, including building an end-to-end innovation center in Shanghai and state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. These are expected to open in calendar year 2022. 
More recently, several of our brands decided to participate in the new partnership of Sephora with Kohl's and Ulta Beauty with Target beginning in the second half of this calendar year. This new consumer coverage represents the promising evolution of the retail landscape, both in-store and online in the United States, for prestige beauty. 
We also agreed to increase our ownership in DECIEM becoming majority investors with a path to full ownership in 3 years. DECIEM with its fast-growing brand, The Ordinary, and new brand incubation capability aligns well with our multiple engines of growth strategy. The Ordinary further diversifies our skin care growth engine by consumer segment, price point and geography with a superior online business. The brand has redefined entry prestige with an increased ingredient-focused regimen-based product portfolio that drives basket size. The Ordinary has quickly established itself as a top 5 skin care brands in the U.S. prestige beauty, having improved its rank significantly over the last year. 
Sustainability is integral to DECIEM equity, products and retail practices, which will enhance our sustainability brand portfolio and fuel the achievement of our ESG strategy and goals. We look forward to continue the exciting journey with Nicola Kilner and her incredibly talented team to realize this global opportunity. 
In the third quarter the Estée Lauder brand delivered stellar results, led by strong double-digit growth in skin care, sequentially improving trends in makeup, and the return to growth in France. The brand is driving a renewal in the signification of makeup trend, with a significant growth of its future its franchise, and its new Beautiful Magnolia fragrance is off to a very promising start. The Estée Lauder skin care franchises performed exceptionally well, led by Advanced Night Repair and its recently reformulated namesake, Serum. Revitalizing Supreme also was a standout as the launch of Supreme Bright proved highly sold. Supreme Bright is an amazing story of east to west success, with a product born in the brightening trend in Asia and realizing global appeals for its uneven skin tone benefits. [indiscernible] new eyes serum surged and created a halo effect for the franchise piece in eye creams. 
La Mer performance was once again outstanding. The brand's worldwide success is multi-facetted from both loyal and new consumers and with increasing demand from men, who now represent more than 15% of sales in Mainland China. La Mer's iconic product rich story telling and ideal merchandising aligned to deliver the successful journey to renewal campaign for Chinese New Year. 
As well, the brand executed a superb global campaign focused on moisturizers. The new [ Genesans] de La Mer, concentrated night ,  continued to spark consumer desires, elevating the brand Ulta luxury franchise. 
Clinique sales growth accelerated sequentially and rose in every region, driven by its skin care portfolio from consumers' excellent response to the new Moisture Surge 100 Hour in the United States, to Even Better Clinical Interrupter showing substantial growth in Mainland China, 2 in-demand hero franchises like Dramatically Different Moisturizing, Clinique prospered. 
Our luxury and artisanal fragrances realized significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific  Like skin care, fragrance offer a means to express self-care, and that's shown through the emotional comfort of scent. We are seeing strong repeat from the emerging category in Asia Pacific while we continue to welcome new consumers in the region. 
These trends in fragrances, driven by our strategic shift to the higher end, is favorable to margin enhancement in the category. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Kilian Paris, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle each grew double digits. Innovation in hero products worked in harmony to fulfill consumer desires, with newness from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty incredibly well received. Kilian Paris virtual selling, which engaged founder Kilian Hennessy, influencers and education ambassadors through live chat and shoppable live streams contributed to superb bottom line growth. 
Each region grew this quarter led by Asia Pacific, which saw sales rise in every category, and many countries contribute. Mainland China was exceptional, delivering sequentially accelerating double-digit sales growth, with skin care and fragrance performing ahead of the previous quarter and makeup returning to growth up double digits. 
Both brick and mortar and online thrived driven by the strong equity of our brands, desirable innovation, high-quality product leading to repeat purchase, competitive investment in advertising and investment in local talent and capabilities. For the Chinese New Year, we met the consumer where she or he chose to shop, serving the local consumer as well, the traveling consumer in Hainan both in-store and retail to tremendous success. 
Online continued to be a powerful growth engine as global sales increased strong double digits in every region. Sales of brand.com third-party platforms and retail.com rose strong double digits, while sales of pure-play grew single-digit as we are building our consumer coverage with select pure-play retailers. Our online channel is now nearly double the size it was 2 years ago. Importantly, the media value of brand.com continued to rise as live chat, virtual try on and live streaming led to increased traffic and time spent on our sites. 
EMEA online sales increased near triple digits, while Latin America's growth was also very high. We adaptively met consumer demand in these regions, which were more pressured than others from temporary brick-and-mortar closures. In Asia Pacific and North America, where in-store traffic is gradually improving and comparisons to the premium year are increasingly more difficult, online sales still grew double digits. 
We are innovating in the high-touch online consumer experience and harnessing our data to increase engagement and drive sales. Let me share 2 examples from e-mail. In the United Kingdom, Clinique launched an integrated platform to deliver seamless end-to-end high-touch virtual experiences with a personalized data-led version of its Skin School on demand. Clinique is providing consultants with data to unlock more sophisticated recommendation with a multitude of tools to ensure the consumer experience is customized based on preferences. Consultants can now enable co-browsing and the adding of friends to services. This new platform, while still in its early days, is delivering above-average conversion rates. 
La Mer enhanced its virtual experiences with more expert classes and 1:1 consultations tailored to local consumers. The brand expanded live chat to every market in the region with standard hours and additional days, leading to incredible growth in conversion. All told, La Mer saw its regional online mix of business surge. 
Our brands are investing for growth with social media platform. Too Faced introduced a new virtual try-on lens on Snapchat to add to its growing portfolio of virtual trial experiences. On TikTok, it launched a mini-movie showcasing the transformative experience of Better Than Sex Mascara via its first world premier on the platform. Dr. Jart+ color correcting treatment [ target ] strong online sales in the United States for the brand, amplified by social selling, TikTok and influencer support.
Looking ahead, we are preparing a renaissance in makeup, and we anticipate the momentum we gradually build around the world driven by local reopening and social and professional locations. Our data and insights are driving new creativity to aspire consumer as they increase their occasion based makeup. We are strategically well positioned to grow our sales and capture prestige beauty share makeup recovery with our hero products, robust innovation pipeline, analytics engine driving aspirational intelligence, and enticing in-store and online activision centered on the omnichannel consumer. Already in the third quarter, newness from Clinique Even Better franchise in foundation and [ consider ] was highly sold as we saw consumer restocking their core makeup products. Too Faced new leap lumper was a major hit. Hero products like Tom Ford Beauty eyeshadows and mascara from Too Faced, the Bobbi Brown also performed very well. Max is launching a new mascara, and there is exciting innovation from many brands To come.
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance despite the surging impact of the pandemic in many countries. We led with our values as we continued to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and consumers. We made progress on our environmental goals, enacted on our social committed. (sic) We invested in accelerating drivers for sustainable growth, including innovation in China, manufacturing in Asia Pacific, global online and consumer analytics. For the long term, we are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to create value for our stockholders. 
I want to say thank you to our employees, who are integral to our success and are making us a better company through this difficult moment. We are beautifully positioned in prestige beauty to continue driving recovery with a house of the most dedicated and talented employees.
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we lapped the onset of the COVID pandemic and delivered exceptional growth in the Asi",1410,"Thank you, Fabrizio. I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. 
For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we lapped the onset of the COVID pandemic and delivered exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region and in the skin care and fragrance categories. While our brick-and-mortar distribution continued to experience soft foot traffic, our online channel delivered strong growth across all formats and all regions. Conversely, the environment in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America were challenged throughout the quarter. 
Our gross margin increased 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Favorability in category and channel mix driven by skin care and online growth as well as lower tester costs, were partially offset by obsolescence, negative currency and COVID-related under-recovery of fixed costs, primarily in our facilities that manufacture makeup products. 
Operating expenses improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the improved sales leverage this year. You will recall that when the pandemic struck in the prior year quarter, the sudden and dramatic drop in sales created expense deleverage that was difficult to fully offset despite the cost actions we took at that time. This quarter, we benefited from both temporary and longer-term cost savings, which is reflected in the substantially lower selling and store operating costs as a percent of sales, continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online as sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online. This was due in part to temporary store closures in response to a resurgence of the virus in certain EMEA and Latin American markets. 
We realized some subsidies and the extension of furlough benefits in some of the affected markets. We have also prudently managed staffing levels in our stores and new hires on our management teams until we see the recovery gaining more consistent momentum. 
Advertising spending grew double digits and was predominantly focused on digital spending. We invested to support our online acceleration as well as our new product launches, a strong recovery in certain markets and key shopping moments such as Lunar New Year, Women's Day and Valentine's Day. 
As a result, our operating margin rose 620 basis points to 20.5%, which was 40 basis points above fiscal '19 levels. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.7%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to a lower rate on the company's foreign operations. 
Diluted EPS of $1.62 increased 92% compared to the prior year. EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher sales, continued cost management and a lower effective tax rate. 
Our plans under the post COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Year-to-date, we have taken actions in 3 main areas: to adjust our distribution footprint in Latin America and EMEA, including travel retail; to exit global distribution of BECCA products; and to realign resources and capabilities, including employee-related costs, between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. We are already beginning to realize some modest benefits from these actions. As the program continues, we expect to further rationalize our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, primarily in western markets. 
For the 9 months, we generated $2.78 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, primarily due to higher net earnings as well as working capital improvements. We invested $386 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like production and distribution capacity and technology, including our online business. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores. 
We ended the period with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including cash from $600 million in senior notes issued in March, to support the increased equity investment in DECIEM once the deal is finalized. 
We also reinstated our share buyback program in March and utilized $316 million of cash to repurchase our stock. And we paid $561 million in dividends. After the end of the quarter, we used $450 million in cash to pay down debt maturing in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation this year, we still remain in a very strong position to pursue further growth opportunities after these actions.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We continue to be encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in our business throughout the fiscal year. And we are optimistic that restrictions and hesitancy on travel and social activities will begin to ease in certain markets as vaccine coverage steadily increases. In China, Australia and Israel, which are at the leading edge of recovery, we are seeing higher makeup sales with usage occasions increasing as social and professional engagement gradually normalize. For example, sales in our freestanding stores in Israel have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and even lipstick sales are almost back to normal. 
The upcoming addition of the DECIEM brands to our portfolio and the expansion of our business with Sephora and Ulta Beauty in the U.S. represent additional growth drivers for us as we progress in recovery from the pandemic shock, giving us further cause for optimism. We have led with our strengths, our values and our amazing team and have proactively addressed areas where -- which we could control, while at the same time ensuring we are protecting our strategic growth areas. 
As a result, in the context of a very challenging environment in fiscal 2021, we expect to end the year with sales growth of between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to add approximately 2 percentage points to reported growth, reflecting rates of $1.18 for the euro, $1.33 for the pound and RMB 6.64 for the yuan. 
6 months of incremental sales from the December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart and approximately 1 month expected from DECIEM are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to our expectations of growth, for the year. 
Mindful of the more gradual resumption of traffic to our brick-and-mortar distribution, we kept tight control over costs this year to protect investments needed for long-term growth. Some of the costs we cut temporarily will gradually return as more doors open. Subsidies will correspondingly diminish, and we plan to meaningfully ramp up advertising spending in our fourth quarter as consumers return to social and professional engagements. That said, we expect to end this fiscal year with an operating margin of approximately 18.5%, an improvement of roughly 100 basis points above fiscal 2019. 
Full year EPS is expected to be between $6.05 and $6.15 before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.10 accretion from currency translation and $0.04 dilution from acquisitions. 
Our fourth quarter sales are expected to rise between 44% and 50% in constant currency. This reflects both the recovery in many parts of the world as well as an easier comparison against the prior year period most impacted by the pandemic. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 4 percentage points. And the addition of approximately 1 month of sales from DECIEM would contribute less than 2 percentage points to sales growth. 
Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be between $0.38 and $0.48, reflecting the sales outlook and increased investments to support the ramp-up of our innovation and manufacturing capabilities in Asia, continued investment to drive our online business, and the advertising and promotion to support recovery, with the resulting operating margin more typical of our pre-pandemic levels of mid- to high single-digit in the quarter. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS. And the addition of DECIEM is immaterial for the quarter given the short time frame and purchase accounting.
In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter in the context of a challenging macro backdrop. Our skin care and fragrance brands have proven to be resilient during this time as consumers shifted online. And we enhanced the digital experience with increased services on our sites. As we navigate through the final months of our fiscal year, we are investing in both the near-term recovery and the drivers of long-term sustainable growth that create value for our multiple stakeholders. While it is difficult to predict the growth of global prestige beauty in the near term, we are confident, as we have demonstrated, that we can nimbly allocate resources to continue to operate with agility and gain share as the recovery gives way to the new normal.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Because as strong as trends are, on a 2-year basis, things were a little bit slower this quarter. And I know the fiscal second quarter, you have 11/11. That's probably a much bigger shopping holiday than Chinese New Year. But from the aggregate level that we see in Asia, things were probably a little bit slower than people expected. 
So could you just give us a little bit more color there describing maybe trends in China -- Mainland China, I should say, versus whether it was Hong Kong, Japan, other areas where things might have slowed down? And also, any other thoughts on Hainan and the degree to which shopping there may be overlapping with things that -- purchases that used to happen in other Asian markets, as Chinese were traveling more overseas that are now maybe repatriating those purchases to Hainan?"

Let me start, and then Tracey will add her perspective. The -- first of all, no, we believe China is super strong. I mean we have accelerated the size -- our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China Mai",498,"Yes. No, sure. Let me start, and then Tracey will add her perspective. 
The -- first of all, no, we believe China is super strong. I mean we have accelerated the size -- our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China Mainland is very, very strong. Now this number includes Dr. Jart+ which is also a strong growing brand in Asia, and now it's part of our portfolio. So all good. 
Now your question on Hainan, Hainan was also strong and continues to grow. And as we said, we really look and manage the Chinese consumer. So we sell to the Chinese consumers where they are. When they travel to Hainan, we sell to them in their travel. And when they are in their cities, we sell to them in the cities. 
The opportunity of continue serving the growing middle class and the multiple smaller cities, which are coming very important for consumption, from which the demand is growing, continues. And we are serving this multiple growth, mainly also the smaller cities, the tier 3, tier 4 and the different consumer groups. We are serving this, both in Mainland and Hainan, when they travel in a very positive way. So China is very strong and, in our opinion, will continue a very strong trend.
The other thing that we have seen, which is important to us in China, is the recovery of makeup. Because China is ahead of other regions in the control of COVID and so in people going back with more confidence to shopping also in brick and mortar. And we see the positive impact on that on makeup, which I said in my prepared remarks grew double digit. And this obviously is encouraging for what the recovery will represent also in the west as the brick-and-mortar sales go back into the new normal.
The other part of your question was about Asia in total. And yes, Hong Kong is obviously smaller than what used to be and the recovery is lower. And so Hong Kong is getting better, but it has been resized, at least for the time being, to what it used to be, so still is a drag versus the historical levels. 
And Japan was definitely hit by a new wave. And there was new closures and a lot of government activity to limit shopping, in brick and mortar anyway, to limit the social life activity, which means, again, very big impact on makeup. 
So -- the Korea on the contrary started recovery, had a better quarter. And Australia at definitely a better quarter. By the way, Australia is another place where it's visible, the recovery of [indiscernible] because of the reopening of the brick and mortar and more social life. 
So Asia was a very mixed pack in summary, very strong China; very strong Hainan; better Korea; a better Australia, New Zealand; and still very hard hit some of the emerging markets, Japan and Hong Kong."

Because people does like to interact with the products and like the experience of shopping together. And so this is really one driver. 
And so in China, we see this getting stronger and as the recovery unleash. What we see in terms of product that people -- and again, I speak about China where this [indiscernible], South Australia, and Israel is another place where we see signs of what happens during the recovery. And the signs are consistent, by the way. 
And first of all, people go back to their core makeup. Also because they have not used it for some time, it may not be fresh anymore, in some cases. So there is a lot of back to foundation to lipstick to mascaras that needs to be purchased back. And depending which region of the world are a different proportion of these subcategories, as you know. But this is back to core. 
But there is also a huge interest in newness is obviously that from an emotional standpoint, people don't want to go back to the past. They want a new normal. They want to forget, actually. It is a very difficult year when they are in a recovery mode and go back to a new future. 
So they look for newness, for novelty. And that's why in our renaissance plan, we are both planning in every region of the world where -- when this recovery will happen. We are ready to bring back our core and allow the consumer to reload what is their core habits the core products, and at the same time, an outstanding mix of new product, innovation, breakthrough idea, fresh, way to use makeup, new looks; and most importantly, looks, which are consistent with the renaissance of the usage occasions. 
Because [indiscernible] makeup is not only about shopping, emotional shopping. It's about having the occasions in your social life, your professional life to use makeup. And so we are studying how those occasions come back and which kind of makeup core and newness is of interest for each occasions. And the occasion are different by region. 
And so with this level of analytics, we are preparing what we call the renaissance, which is a comeback but is very specific. And our ability today to manage this with precisions and avoid excessive push or avoiding wrong subcategories focus, in other words, ensuring a good return of our investments during the recovery. Our ability to do that has dramatically increased, thanks to analytics which are not only giving us more data to understand what's happening, but it's giving us more data to anticipate what is going to happen, and that's what we are working on."

As you said, we have done well for many years, but he's here to bring it to a completely new level. And so the priority is first of all, to continue our growth and leverage this huge acceleration in every single channel in brand.com, in third parties, in pure plays, in retail.com, and in making sure that we have the circulation of the best practices around the world, that we learn from what's happening in every angle of the world, both in our business and what competition or retailers are doing a third-party are doing. 
But I would say the center of all this is to add more technology in order to make the consumer experience in each one of these touch points really, really high quality, even more competitive. So the focus is on taking the consumer experience to the next level. You heard me speaking in the past about chats, virtual try on, live streaming, and many other experiences that are possible but need to become better and better over time and surprise the consumer for positive. And if we do that correctly, we will continue to drive traffic to our online. Because we'll attract traffic not only because of our great brands, of our great innovation, but also because of our outstanding services online and because of the experience online that will be frictionless. And also, we will need to make sure that this happens in a very efficient way and in a way which is driven by technology and become consistent across the world so that we can scale it very fast every single time, this is going to be needed. 
And finally, we -- also one of the priorities is to make digital advertising, and particularly all the advertiser linked to e-commerce more efficient and more effective, and with this to continue to push conversion. That will be one of the key challenges and the key opportunities of the next years in the world of online."

And so it's, I would say, that the recovery will be a net extra versus what is already growth. So what's happened in this period, as you all know, is that the domestic travel in general, and particularly within China, has been more than offsetting the lack of international travel all over the world and particularly in the west. And so in this moment, we expect the strengths that today are in travel retail in domestic travel in China with Hainan and with new centers like Shenzhen, the [ Greater Bay] and other opportunities, which are emerging over time, we expect this to continue and to remain very, very solid. 
But then at a certain moment when international travel will be restated, then we expect international travel to bring net extra opportunities, particularly in the west where there will be, obviously, many more populations going back to travel. And when this will happen, we envision travel retail to be even stronger than what used to be historically and definitely stronger than today, which is mainly driven by only the domestic travel part. 
So strong reality today, a strong future for travel retail. Now travel retail is about traffic, which is what I was commenting on now speaking about the future recovery in international travel. But it's also drove by conversion, which is the percentage of travelers that buy something. So we have seen recently the conversion going up driven by retail, so the ability to buy online when you travel. 
Now pretail is accelerating in Asia. It's a very -- it's already about 1/3 of the business in many parts of Asia and is not yet very present or very significant in the west. So we see in the future pretail to continue to grow and to be a significant part on travel retail. And with the growth of pretail, we see the opportunity of increased growth or conversion. And in that sense, the traffic coming back plus conversion of travelers into buyers continue to progress. Those 2 KPIs will represent a very solid future for travel retail."

Our travel retail team is. 
So international travel is really projected at this point in time not to recover until perhaps even the second half of fiscal -- our fiscal '22. So again, we're watching it closely obviously. If it recovers sooner, the travel retail business internationally in terms of consumption would pick up correspondingly. 
But in the meantime, the travel retail team has done a fantastic job of making sure that we are managing the western travel retail markets prudently in terms of investments until we see the recovery of traffic and consumption in the western markets. 
And the only thing -- the other thing I would say is that travel retail and online combined now are a little more than half of our total business. And so when you think about our growth momentum going forward and the recovery, the strength that we see in online and the recovery of travel retail, it bodes very well for our future growth."

I know that 2Q is always bigger than 3Q, but the drop down from 2Q to 3Q in terms of revenue was larger than is typical, pretty much across every region but especially Asia Pacific. 
It begs 1 or 2 questions. One, was last quarter maybe a bit inflated, with some retailers once again kind of stepping into the market reloading inventory? Or are we seeing more of a setback? I mean I know you talked about some markets tightening down. But generally, from where we sit and look globally, it looks like the world is slowly reopening, obviously not all consistently.

So Q2, as you indicate, has become a very large quarter for us. It always was a large quarter with holiday. But with the addition of 11.11 and the tremendous growth of that holiday year-over-year, we're seeing a very large sales number in our second quarter. 
In the third quarter, as Fabrizio mentioned, China had a very strong third quarter. We did have some large markets in Asia that were a bit softer, Japan. And I think through this pandemic, we're going to see ups and downs until things really more sustainably get back to normal when vaccine rates obviously accelerate a bit. So I would not read anything long term into it other than this is still part of the pandemic in terms of seeing up and down performance in various markets. 
Similarly in terms of EMEA as well, obviously, outside of travel retail, but the western markets in EMEA were also quite challenged in the quarter as well. So that we expect to see until, again, we see more stabilization and normalization from the pandemic."

I would read in this more of a strong quarter 2, particularly driven by an extraordinary 11.11 where some of our brands were top in the 11.11 project. And by the fact that holidays were a moment, also in the West, they were pretty positive. People, where possible, were allowed when back to shopping. Some brick and mortar were open. And then maybe because these holidays, in some places were opened too early. Then there was a lot of closures immediately after. And so Japan, U.K., Italy, [indiscernible] North America, Canada, so we got an enormous amount of closures in the January, March period. And in the west particularly, in Japan obviously. 
And so that's the combination. The combination is the pandemic impact on brick and mortar. Now keep in mind that, as you have seen in the results, we have an extraordinary skin care and fragrance, and also our data brand is doing really strong. The question is the makeup recovery. And the makeup is very linked to the comeback of the brick-and-mortar experience. So all the closures that happen actually after the holidays in many western markets and in Japan did have an impact on makeup, and we have seen that. 
So I would not say there is any long-term sign in this quarter 3. Actually is an extraordinarily strong quarter 3. By the way, was ahead of our guidance. Because we have seen that in our guidance. We have seen these kind of things that would have happened because of the closures. 
And so it was a very strong quarter. And quarter 2 was just an extraordinary quarter. But as Tracey said, quarter 2 will be pretty strong because in the future, there will be always a combination of holidays and strong peak of commercial activities like 11.11 and more that will create a high in terms of absolute level of sales."

As I said before, I want to repeat that. Makeup is about usage occasions. So -- and the usage occasion on makeup are exactly the social and professional occasions that when there are closures, when the pandemic is very active, are not there. And so consumption goes down. So we are really -- we don't see any reason why we will not go back to, first, stabilization and then growth in makeup when these social locations come back and this professional occasion come back. 
I just want to take the opportunity to make the pictures. So today, we have our current drivers, which are the Chinese consumer. The global online and the skin care category and now the high end fragrance category that will continue to drive. There is no discussion. This these areas have been accelerated by COVID. But in reality, their trends were strong already before. So COVID has accelerated, and we are very ready. 
And as you see, we are having great success on these drivers even in the middle of COVID. Now there are new drivers that should be added to these drivers as COVID will abate. Makeup usage, as I said, brick-and-mortar productivity in most markets, certain markets and consumer groups like U.S., U.K., Japan, Continental Europe, emerging markets that today are unfortunately really badly hit by COVID well come back and will gradually come back as the COVID improve. Younger consumer consumption, which is especially linked to makeup, will come back. And the TR outside of Hainan as we said before, and the pretail acceleration will come back. So there are all these new drivers that we need to accelerate in the next 18 months, assuming that will be the pace of return from COVID gradually. 
Then there are new strengths that we have built during COVID, and we have invested there. There is better innovation in Asia with the center in Shanghai and the quality of our innovation. That is creating higher repeat purchase rate. There is more skin care, a more makeup [ skin indication ]. And we have more production capacity of high-quality production capacity in our upcoming factory in Tokyo. Better consumer understanding and better ability to anticipate trends, driven by our investment in analytics, more resources for advertising, especially to digital advertising, which is increasing, better high-touch services online, as I explained before when there was the question on online. A brand portfolio, which is becoming a stronger and stronger with the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ A huge investment and acceleration in every ESG activity during [ COVID ]. 
And all of this combined is what I call the new strengths that we are bringing to the party. So the way we see it is that the current drivers will drive. The new drivers, including makeup, will come back. And the new strengths that we've built in Estée lauder companies during this year will hit. And that's why we really believe that this quarter is just the confirmation that we are creating a very solid, long-term sustainable broadcaster for the company."

I mean you noted this quarter that they are temporary, but also longer-term cost savings is substantially lower operating costs in-store with the shift online. There's some subsidies in play, but you're also reallocating costs for the longer term from brick-and-mortar to online. channel mix is obviously going to be a dynamic going forward. 
And I guess underlying the question is that margins continue to come through at a much higher level. channel mix is clearly an element. But there are some costs that have come out permanently, but also costs that are going to be coming back into the base. 
And so I guess getting back to it, I wonder how you view this fiscal '21 target? Do you think that you can move up from there with all the initiatives that you have noted? Or would you expect some sort of a step back as you weather some of these costs coming back in the base and channel mix evolving over the next year?"

So Chris, as you know, we typically give forward guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in August, which we will certainly do. I mean this has been an unusual year because of all of the things that you've mentioned. We had part of the year where we had temporary salary reductions. We've had furloughs. And we've also done a fantastic job, our teams have, in terms of managing costs. 
Some of those costs will come back next year, and some of them won't. Some of the door closures that we've permanently done, those costs and the remaining fleet of doors should be more productive as traffic continues to accelerate to brick and mortar which is where we see bulk of the recovery. 
So given the cost actions that we've taken, given where we expect growth to come from next year disproportionately, we would expect continued margin progression, but we'll be able to say more specifically what that will be in the August time frame. But as we've said for many years, our growth areas all margin accretive. When you think about travel retail, when you think about online, when you think about the strength that we've had over multiple years in terms of skin care. And as Fabrizio said, we expect skin care and fragrance to continue to grow and makeup will also grow more strongly, certainly next year as those occasions come back. 
So we've got multiple engines, multiple ways to progress margin even as investments do come back for brick-and-mortar and in other areas. We will in the fourth quarter, as you indicate and I said in my prepared remarks, so strongly invest as we normally do for a start of a strong fiscal year. And we will invest more in advertising to support what we believe will be an acceleration selectively in the markets that we think that it will happen in."

It's a pleasure to speak with you today, and I hope that you and your families are in good health. Our hearts are with those impacted by COVID-19, particularly in places like India and Brazil that are experiencing severe resurgences. We remain committed to doing what we can to support our employees and these communities. 
Our third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 marks the continuation of strong sequential sales growth improvements, despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. We exceeded our sales and earnings growth expectation even as several markets experienced increasing COVID-19 pressure throughout the quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy drove our success, empowered by the exceptional creativity and passion of our employees. 
We achieved these outstanding results while acting on our values. First and foremost, we continue to invest in employees and consumer safety and well-being during the health crisis. We expanded our work for the environment, from setting innovative new sustainability goals in travel retail, to seeing a wide farm -- wind farm in Oklahoma become fully operational, which is our largest renewable energy contract to date, and a project we were proud to support. We made progress on our racial equity commitments and also outlined a new set of commitments for women advance and gender equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increased representation of women from underrepresented groups. 
In March, we launched our new equity and engagement center of excellence to drive greater equity representation within our business and across the value chain. We also launched a partnership with Howard University to support the success of its alumni through our experiential learning, career coaching, professional training and mentorship opportunities. 
While there was joy in this progress, there was also sorrow. We stood with our employees, consumers and partners in denouncing the rise in act of violence, hate and discrimination against the Asia and Pacific Islander community, and committed to donate to organization that support justice and equal treatment from Asian community in the United States. We keep our employees and communities top of mind through these challenging times.
With that as our guiding principle, let me turn back to financial results. Constant currency sales rose 13%, representing a sequential acceleration of organic sales growth improvement. We delivered a strong performance despite increased COVID-19 hardship in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America during the quarter. Estée Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty led the impressive performance of many brands. 
Skin care and fragrance once again delivered superior sales growth, although they had the toughest comparison to the year-ago period. In fact, our skin care category was nearly 30% larger on a reported basis this quarter than it was 2 years ago, owing to innovation in our powerful hero franchises, strength across multiple subcategories and the addition of Dr. Jart+, but before the future inclusion of DECIEM.
And our fragrance category was 16% bigger than it was in fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, driven by our strategic focus on the luxury and artisanal segments. Both of these categories now have even greater scale to capture prestige beauty share as the recovery unfolds. 
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we focused our investment decisions on engines of growth and employed cost discipline in other areas, resulting in a near doubling of adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year period. While the complexities of the pandemic are ever present, adjusted operating margin nonetheless exceeded that of the third quarter of fiscal year '19, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 5% higher. 
Throughout the pandemic, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the long term as we successfully navigate the short term. We continue to strategically invest to drive sustainable growth, including building an end-to-end innovation center in Shanghai and state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. These are expected to open in calendar year 2022. 
More recently, several of our brands decided to participate in the new partnership of Sephora with Kohl's and Ulta Beauty with Target beginning in the second half of this calendar year. This new consumer coverage represents the promising evolution of the retail landscape, both in-store and online in the United States, for prestige beauty. 
We also agreed to increase our ownership in DECIEM, becoming majority investors with a path to full ownership in 3 years. DECIEM, with its fast-growing brand, The Ordinary, and new brand incubation capability aligns well with our multiple engines of growth strategy. The Ordinary further diversifies our skin care growth engine by consumer segment, price point and geography with a superior online business. The brand has redefined entry prestige with an increased ingredient-focused regimen-based product portfolio that drives basket size. The Ordinary has quickly established itself as a top 5 skin care brands in the U.S. prestige beauty, having improved its rank significantly over the last year. 
Sustainability is integral to DECIEM equity, products and retail practices, which will enhance our sustainability brand portfolio and fuel the achievement of our ESG strategy and goals. We look forward to continue the exciting journey with Nicola Kilner and her incredibly talented team to realize DECIEM global opportunity. 
In the third quarter the Estée Lauder brand delivered stellar results, led by strong double-digit growth in skin care, sequentially improving trends in makeup, and the return to growth in fragrance. The brand is driving a renewal in the skin-ification on makeup trend, with a significant growth of its future-rich franchise, and its new Beautiful Magnolia fragrance is off to a very promising start. The Estée Lauder skin care franchises performed exceptionally well, led by Advanced Night Repair and its recently reformulated namesake, Serum. Revitalizing Supreme also was a standout as the launch of Supreme+ Bright proved highly sold. Supreme+ Bright is an amazing story of east to west success, with a product born in the brightening trend in Asia and realizing global appeals for its uneven skin tone benefits. Re-Nutriv, new eyes serum, surged and created a halo effect for the franchise space in eye creams. 
La Mer performance was once again outstanding. The brand's worldwide success is multi-facetted from both loyal and new consumers and with increasing demand from men, who now represent more than 15% of sales in Mainland China. La Mer's iconic product, rich storytelling and ideal merchandising align to deliver the successful journey to renewal campaign for Chinese New Year. 
As well, the brand executed a superb global campaign focused on moisturizers. The new Genaissance de La Mer The Concentrated Night Balm continue to spark consumer desires, elevating the brand Ulta luxury franchise. 
Clinique sales growth accelerated sequentially and rose in every region, driven by its skin care portfolio from consumers' excellent response to the new Moisture Surge 100 Hour in the United States, to Even Better Clinical Interrupter hewing substantial growth in Mainland China, 2 in-demand hero franchises like Dramatically Different Moisturizing, Clinique prospered. 
Our luxury and artisanal fragrances realized significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Like skin care, fragrance offer a means to express self-care, and that's shown through the emotional comfort of scent. We are seeing strong repeat from the emerging category in Asia Pacific while we continue to welcome new consumers in the region. 
These trends in fragrances, driven by our strategic shift to the higher end, is favorable to margin enhancement in the category. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, KILIAN PARIS, Le Labo and Frédéric Malle each grew double digits. Innovation and hero products worked in harmony to fulfill consumer desires, with newness from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty incredibly well received. KILIAN PARIS' virtual selling, which engaged founder Kilian Hennessy, influencers and education ambassadors through live chat and shoppable live streams contributed to superb online growth. 
Each region grew this quarter led by Asia Pacific, which saw sales rise in every category, and many countries contribute. Mainland China was exceptional, delivering sequentially accelerating double-digit sales growth, with skin care and fragrance performing ahead of the previous quarter and makeup returning to growth, up double digits. Both brick and mortar and online thrived driven by the strong equity of our brands, desirable innovation, high-quality product leading to repeat purchase, competitive investment in advertising and investment in local talent and capabilities. 
For the Chinese New Year, we met the consumer where she or he chose to shop, serving the local consumer as well, the traveling consumer in Hainan, both in-store and retail to tremendous success. 
Online continued to be a powerful growth engine as global sales increased strong double digits in every region. Sales of brand.com, third-party platforms and retail.com rose strong double digits, while sales of pure-play grew triple-digit as we are building our consumer coverage with select pure-play retailers. Our online channel is now nearly double the size it was 2 years ago. Importantly, the media value of brand.com continued to rise as live chat, virtual try on and live streaming led to increased traffic and time spent on our sites. 
EMEA online sales increased near triple digits, while Latin America's growth was also very high. We adaptively met consumer demand in these regions, which were more pressured than others from temporary brick-and-mortar closures. In Asia Pacific and North America, where in-store traffic is gradually improving and comparisons to the [ previous ] year are increasingly more difficult, online sales still grew double digits. 
We are innovating in the high-touch online consumer experience and harnessing our data to increase engagement and drive sales. Let me share 2 examples from EMEA. In the United Kingdom, Clinique launched an integrated platform to deliver seamless end-to-end high-touch virtual experiences with a personalized data-led version of its Skin School on demand. Clinique is providing consultants with data to unlock more sophisticated recommendation with a multitude of tools to ensure the consumer experience is customized based on preferences. Consultants can now enable co-browsing and the adding of friends to services. This new platform, while still in its early days, is delivering above-average conversion rates. 
La Mer enhanced its virtual experiences with more expert classes and 1:1 consultations tailored to local consumers. The brand expanded live chat to every market in the region with standard hours and additional days, leading to incredible growth in conversion. All told, La Mer saw its regional online mix of business surge. 
Our brands are investing for growth with social media platform. Too Faced introduced a new virtual try-on lens on Snapchat to add to its growing portfolio of virtual try-on experiences. On TikTok, it launched a mini-movie showcasing the transformative experience of Better Than Sex Mascara via its first world premiere on the platform. Dr. Jart+ Cicapair's color correcting treatment started strong online sales in the United States for the brand, amplified by social selling, TikTok and influencer support.
Looking ahead, we are preparing a renaissance in makeup, and we anticipate the momentum we gradually build around the world driven by local reopening and social and professional occasions. Our data and insights are driving new creativity to inspire consumer as they increase their occasion-based makeup. We are strategically well positioned to grow our sales and capture prestige beauty share makeup recovery with our hero products, robust innovation pipeline, analytics engine driving aspirational intelligence, and enticing in-store and online activation centered on the omnichannel consumer. 
Already in the third quarter, newness from Clinique Even Better franchise in foundation and concealer was highly sold as we saw consumer restocking their core makeup products. Too Faced new lip plumper was a major hit. Hero products like Tom Ford Beauty eyeshadows and mascara from Too Faced, the Bobbi Brown also performed very well. Mac is launching a new mascara, and there is exciting innovation from many brands to come.
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance despite the surging impact of the pandemic in many countries. We led with our values as we continued to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and consumers. We made progress on our environmental goals, enacted on our social commitments. We invested in accelerating drivers for sustainable growth, including innovation in China, manufacturing in Asia Pacific, global online and consumer analytics. For the long term, we are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to create value for our stockholders. 
I want to say thank you to our employees, who are integral to our success and are making us a better company through this difficult moment. We are beautifully positioned in prestige beauty to continue driving recovery with a house of the most dedicated and talented employees.
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we lapped the onset of the COVID pandemic and delivered exceptional growth in the Asi",1409,"Thank you, Fabrizio. I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. 
For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we lapped the onset of the COVID pandemic and delivered exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region and in the skin care and fragrance categories. While our brick-and-mortar distribution continued to experience soft foot traffic, our online channel delivered strong growth across all formats and all regions. Conversely, the environments in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America were challenged throughout the quarter. 
Our gross margin increased 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Favorability in category and channel mix driven by skin care and online growth as well as lower tester costs, were partially offset by obsolescence, negative currency and COVID-related under-recovery of fixed costs, primarily in our facilities that manufacture makeup products. 
Operating expenses improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the improved sales leverage this year. You will recall that when the pandemic struck in the prior year quarter, the sudden and dramatic drop in sales created expense deleverage that was difficult to fully offset despite the cost actions we took at that time. 
This quarter, we benefited from both temporary and longer-term cost savings, which is reflected in the substantially lower selling and store operating costs as a percent of sales, continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online as sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online. This was due in part to temporary store closures in response to a resurgence of the virus in certain EMEA and Latin American markets. 
We realized some subsidies and the extension of furlough benefits in some of the affected markets. We've also prudently managed staffing levels in our stores and new hires on our management teams until we see the recovery gaining more consistent momentum. 
Advertising spending grew double digits and was predominantly focused on digital spending. We invested to support our online acceleration as well as our new product launches, a strong recovery in certain markets and key shopping moments such as Lunar New Year, Women's Day and Valentine's Day. 
As a result, our operating margin rose 620 basis points to 20.5%, which was 40 basis points above fiscal '19 levels. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.7%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to a lower rate on the company's foreign operations. 
Diluted EPS of $1.62 increased 92% compared to the prior year. EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the higher sales, continued cost management and a lower effective tax rate. 
Our plans under the post COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Year-to-date, we have taken actions in 3 main areas: to adjust our distribution footprint in Latin America and EMEA, including travel retail; to exit global distribution of BECCA products; and to realign resources and capabilities, including employee-related costs, between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. We are already beginning to realize some modest benefits from these actions. As the program continues, we expect to further rationalize our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, primarily in western markets. 
For the 9 months, we generated $2.78 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, primarily due to higher net earnings as well as working capital improvements. We invested $386 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like production and distribution capacity and technology, including our online business. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores. 
We ended the period with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including cash from $600 million in senior notes issued in March, to support the increased equity investment in DECIEM once the deal is finalized. 
We also reinstated our share buyback program in March and utilized $316 million of cash to repurchase our stock. And we paid $561 million in dividends. After the end of the quarter, we used $450 million in cash to pay down debt maturing in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation this year, we still remain in a very strong position to pursue further growth opportunities after these actions.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We continue to be encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in our business throughout the fiscal year. And we are optimistic that restrictions and hesitancy on travel and social activities will begin to ease in certain markets as vaccine coverage steadily increases. 
In China, Australia and Israel, which are at the leading edge of recovery, we are seeing higher makeup sales with usage occasions increasing as social and professional engagement gradually normalize. For example, sales in our freestanding stores in Israel have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and even lipstick sales are almost back to normal. 
The upcoming addition of the DECIEM brands to our portfolio and the expansion of our business with Sephora and Ulta Beauty in the U.S. represent additional growth drivers for us as we progress in recovery from the pandemic shock, giving us further cause for optimism. We have led with our strengths, our values and our amazing team and have proactively addressed areas where -- which we could control, while at the same time ensuring we are protecting our strategic growth areas. 
As a result, in the context of a very challenging environment in fiscal 2021, we expect to end the year with sales growth of between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to add approximately 2 percentage points to reported growth, reflecting rates of $1.18 for the euro, $1.33 for the pound and KRW 6.64 for the won. 
6 months of incremental sales from the December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart+ and approximately 1 month expected from DECIEM are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to our expectations of growth, for the year. 
Mindful of the more gradual resumption of traffic to our brick-and-mortar distribution, we kept tight control over costs this year to protect investments needed for long-term growth. Some of the costs we cut temporarily will gradually return as more doors open. Subsidies will correspondingly diminish, and we plan to meaningfully ramp up advertising spending in our fourth quarter as consumers return to social and professional engagements. That said, we expect to end this fiscal year with an operating margin of approximately 18.5%, an improvement of roughly 100 basis points above fiscal 2019. 
Full year EPS is expected to be between $6.05 and $6.15 before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.10 accretion from currency translation and $0.04 dilution from acquisitions. 
Our fourth quarter sales are expected to rise between 44% and 50% in constant currency. This reflects both the recovery in many parts of the world as well as an easier comparison against the prior year period most impacted by the pandemic. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 4 percentage points. And the addition of approximately 1 month of sales from DECIEM would contribute less than 2 percentage points to sales growth. 
Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be between $0.38 and $0.48, reflecting the sales outlook and increased investments to support the ramp-up of our innovation and manufacturing capabilities in Asia, continued investment to drive our online business, and the advertising and promotion to support recovery, with the resulting operating margin more typical of our pre-pandemic levels of mid- to high single-digit in the quarter. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS. And the addition of DECIEM is immaterial for the quarter given the short time frame and purchase accounting.
In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter in the context of a challenging macro backdrop. Our skin care and fragrance brands have proven to be resilient during this time as consumers shifted online. And we enhanced the digital experience with increased services on our sites. As we navigate through the final months of our fiscal year, we are investing in both the near-term recovery and the drivers of long-term sustainable growth that create value for our multiple stakeholders. While it is difficult to predict the growth of global prestige beauty in the near term, we are confident, as we have demonstrated, that we can nimbly allocate resources to continue to operate with agility and gain share as the recovery gives way to the new normal.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Because as strong as trends are, on a 2-year basis, things were a little bit slower this quarter. And I know the fiscal second quarter, you have 11.11. That's probably a much bigger shopping holiday than Chinese New Year. But from the aggregate level that we see in Asia, things were probably a little bit slower than people expected. 
So could you just give us a little bit more color there describing maybe trends in China -- Mainland China, I should say, versus whether it was Hong Kong, Japan, other areas where things might have slowed down? And also, any other thoughts on Hainan and the degree to which shopping there may be overlapping with things that -- purchases that used to happen in other Asian markets, as Chinese were traveling more overseas that are now maybe repatriating those purchases to Hainan?"

Let me start, and then Tracey will add her perspective. 
The -- first of all, no, we believe China is super strong. I mean we have accelerated the size -- our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China Mainland is very, very strong. Now this number includes Dr. Jart+ which is also a strong growing brand in Asia, and now it's part of our portfolio. So all good. 
Now your question on Hainan, Hainan was also strong and continues to grow. And as we said, we really look and manage the Chinese consumer. So we sell to the Chinese consumers where they are. When they travel to Hainan, we sell to them in their travel. And when they are in their cities, we sell to them in the cities. 
The opportunity of continued serving the growing middle class and the multiple smaller cities, which are becoming very important for consumption, from which the demand is growing, continues. And we are serving this multiple growth, mainly also the smaller cities, the Tier 3, Tier 4 and the different consumer groups. We are serving this, both in Mainland and Hainan, when they travel in a very positive way. So China is very strong and, in our opinion, will continue a very strong trend.
The other thing that we've seen, which is important to us in China, is the recovery of makeup. Because China is ahead of other regions in the control of COVID and so in people going back with more confidence to shopping also in brick and mortar. And we see the positive impact on that on makeup, which, as said in my prepared remarks, grew double digit. And this obviously is encouraging for what the recovery will represent also in the west as the brick-and-mortar sales go back into the new normal.
The other part of your question was about Asia in total. And yes, Hong Kong is obviously smaller than what used to be and the recovery is slower. And so Hong Kong is getting better, but it has been resized, at least for the time being, to what used to be, so still is a drag versus the historical levels. 
And Japan was definitely hit by a new wave. And there was new closures and a lot of government activity to limit shopping, in brick and mortar anyway, to limit the social life activity, which means, again, very big impact on makeup. 
So the -- Korea on the contrary started recovery, had a better quarter. And Australia had definitely a better quarter. By the way, Australia is another place where it's visible, the recovery of makeup because of the reopening of the brick and mortar and more social life. 
So Asia was a very mixed pack. In summary, very strong China; very strong Hainan; better Korea; a better Australia, New Zealand; and still very hard hit some of the emerging markets, Japan and Hong Kong."

Because people does like to interact with the products and like the experience of shopping together. And so this is really one driver. 
And so in China, we see this getting stronger and -- as the recovery unleash. What we see in terms of product that people -- and again, I speak about China where this is active, those -- Australia, and Israel is another place where we see signs of what happens during the recovery. And the signs are consistent, by the way. 
And first of all, people go back to their core makeup. Also because they have not used it for some time, it may not be fresh anymore, in some cases. So there is a lot of back to foundation, to lipstick, to mascaras that needs to be purchased back. And depending which region of the world, there are different proportion of these subcategories, as you know. But this is back to core. 
But there is also a huge interest in newness. It's obviously that from an emotional standpoint, people don't want to go back to the past. They want a new normal. They want to forget, actually, this very difficult year when they are in a recovery mood and go back to a new future. 
So they look for newness, for novelty. And that's why in our renaissance plan, we are both planning in every region of the world with where, when this recovery will happen. We are ready to bring back our core and allow the consumer to reload what is their core habits, the core products, and at the same time, an outstanding mix of new product, innovation, breakthrough idea, fresh way to use makeup, new looks; and most importantly, looks, which are consistent with the renaissance of the usage occasions. 
Because to be -- [ look here ], makeup is not only about shopping, emotional shopping. It's about having the occasions in your social life, your professional life to use makeup. And so we are studying how those occasions come back and which kind of makeup core and newness is of interest for each occasions. And the occasion are different by region. 
And so with this level of analytics, we are preparing what we call the renaissance, which is a comeback but is very specific. And our ability today to manage this with precisions and avoid excessive push or avoiding wrong subcategories focus, in other words, ensuring a good return of our investments during the recovery.

First of all, Gibu is now in -- seen some months and is an exceptional new lead -- new hire and a leader well integrated by now in our organization. He will bring our online business to next level. As you said, we have done well for many years, but he's here to bring it to a completely new level. And so the priority is, first of all, to continue our growth and leverage this huge acceleration in every single channel in brand.com, in third parties, in pure plays, in retail.com, and in making sure that we have the circulation of the best practices around the world, that we learn from what's happening in every angle of the world, both in our business and in what competition or retailers are doing, third-party are doing. 
But I would say the center of all this is to add more technology in order to make the consumer experience in each one of these touch points really, really high quality, even more competitive. So the focus is on taking the consumer experience to the next level. You heard me speaking in the past about chats, virtual try-on, live streaming, and many other experiences that are possible but need to become better and better over time and surprise the consumer for positive. 
And if we do that correctly, we will continue to drive traffic to our online. Because we'll attract traffic not only because of our great brands, of our great innovation, but also because of our outstanding services online and because of the experience online that will be frictionless. And also, we will need to make sure that this happens in a very efficient way and in a way which is driven by technology and become consistent across the world so that we can scale it very fast every single time this is going to be needed. 
And finally, we -- also one of the priorities is to make digital advertising, and particularly all the advertiser linked to e-commerce more efficient and more effective, and with this to continue to push conversion. That will be one of the key challenges and the key opportunities of the next years in the world of online."

And so is, I would say, that the recovery will be a net extra versus what is already growth. So what's happened in this period, as you all know, is that the domestic travel in general, and particularly within China, has been more than offsetting the lack of international travel all over the world and particularly in the west. 
And so in this moment, we expect the strengths that today are in travel retail, in domestic travel in China with Hainan and with new centers like Shenzhen, the Greater Bay and other opportunities, which are emerging over time, we expect this to continue and to remain very, very solid. 
But then at a certain moment when international travel will be restated, then we expect international travel to bring net extra opportunities, particularly in the west where there will be, obviously, many more populations going back to travel. And when this will happen, we envision travel retail to be even stronger than what used to be historically and definitely stronger than today, which is mainly driven by only the domestic travel part. 
So strong reality today, a strong future for travel retail. Now travel retail is about traffic, which is what I was commenting on now, speaking about the future recovery in international travel. But it's also drove by conversion, which is the percentage of travelers that buy something. So we have seen recently the conversion going up driven by pre-tail, so the ability to buy online when you travel. 
Now pre-tail is accelerating in Asia. It's a very -- it's already about 1/3 of the business in many parts of Asia and is not yet very present or very significant in the west. So we see, in the future, pre-tail to continue to grow and to be a significant part on travel retail. And with the growth of pre-tail, we see the opportunity of increased growth or conversion. And in that sense, the traffic coming back plus conversion of travelers into buyers continue to progress. Those 2 KPIs will represent a very solid future for travel retail."

So international travel is really projected, at this point in time, not to recover until perhaps even the second half of fiscal -- our fiscal '22. So again, we're watching it closely obviously. If it recovers sooner, the travel retail business, internationally in terms of consumption, would pick up correspondingly. 
But in the meantime, the travel retail team has done a fantastic job of making sure that we are managing the western travel retail markets prudently in terms of investments until we see the recovery of traffic and consumption in the western markets. 
And the only thing -- the other thing I would say is that travel retail and online combined now are a little more than half of our total business. And so when you think about our growth momentum going forward and the recovery, the strength that we see in online and the recovery of travel retail, it bodes very well for our future growth."

It begs 1 or 2 questions. One, was last quarter may be a bit inflated, with some retailers once again kind of stepping into the market reloading inventory? Or are we seeing more of a setback? I mean I know you talked about some markets tightening down. But generally, from where we sit and look globally, it looks like the world is slowly reopening, obviously not all consistently.

So Q2, as you indicate, has become a very large quarter for us. It always was a large quarter with holiday. But with the addition of 11.11 and the tremendous growth of that holiday year-over-year, we're seeing a very large sales number in our second quarter. 
In the third quarter, as Fabrizio mentioned, China had a very strong third quarter. We did have some large markets in Asia that were a bit softer, Japan. And I think through this pandemic, we're going to see ups and downs until things really more sustainably get back to normal when vaccine rates obviously accelerate a bit. So I would not read anything long term into it other than this is still part of the pandemic in terms of seeing up and down performance in various markets. 
Similarly in terms of EMEA as well, obviously, outside of travel retail, but the western markets in EMEA were also quite challenged in the quarter as well. So that we expect to see until, again, we see more stabilization and normalization from the pandemic."

I would read in this more of a strong quarter 2, particularly driven by an extraordinary 11.11 where some of our brands were top in the 11.11 project. And by the fact that holidays were a moment, also in the West, they were pretty positive. People, where possible and where allowed went back to shopping. Some brick and mortar were open. And then maybe because these holidays, in some places, were opened too early. Then there was a lot of closures immediately after that. So Japan, U.K., Italy, part of North America, Canada, so we got an enormous amount of closures in the January-March period and in the west particularly, in Japan obviously. 
And so that's the combination. The combination is the pandemic impact on brick and mortar. Now keep in mind that, as you have seen in the results, we have an extraordinary skin care and fragrance, and also our data brand is doing really strong. The question is the makeup recovery. And the makeup is very linked to the comeback of the brick-and-mortar experience. So all the closures that happen actually after the holidays in many western markets and in Japan did have an impact on makeup, and we have seen that. 
So I will not say there is any long-term sign in this quarter 3. Actually, it's an extraordinarily strong quarter 3. By the way, was ahead of our guidance. Because we have seen that in our guidance. We have seen these kind of things that would have happened because of the closures. 
And so it was a very strong quarter. And quarter 2 was just an extraordinary quarter. But as Tracey said, quarter 2 will be pretty strong because in the future, there will be always a combination of holidays and strong peak of commercial activities like 11.11 and more that will create a high in terms of absolute level of sales."

As I said before, I want to repeat that makeup is about usage occasions. So -- and the usage occasion on makeup are exactly the social and professional occasions that when there are closures, when the pandemic is very active, are not there. And so consumption goes down. So we are really -- we don't see any reason why we will not go back to, first, stabilization and then growth in makeup when these social occasions come back and these professional occasions come back. 
I just want to take the opportunity to make the pictures. So today, we have our current drivers, which are the Chinese consumer, the global online and the skin care category and now the high end fragrance category that will continue to drive. There is no discussion. These areas have been accelerated by COVID. But in reality, their trends were strong already before. So COVID has accelerated, and we are very ready. And as you see, we are having great success on these drivers even in the middle of COVID. 
Now there are new drivers that should be added to these drivers as COVID will abate. Makeup usage, as I said, brick-and-mortar productivity in most markets, certain markets and consumer groups like U.S., U.K., Japan, Continental Europe, emerging markets that today are unfortunately really badly hit by COVID will come back and will gradually come back as the COVID improve. Younger consumer consumption, which is especially linked to makeup, will come back. And the tier outside of Hainan as we said before, and the pre-tail acceleration will come back. So there are all these new drivers that we need to accelerate in the next 18 months, assuming that would be the pace of return from COVID gradually. 
Then there are new strengths that we have built during COVID, and we have invested there. There is better innovation in Asia with the center in Shanghai and the quality of our innovation. That is creating higher repeat purchase rate. There is more skin care, a more makeup skin-ification and we have more production capacity, of high-quality production capacity in our upcoming factory in Tokyo; better consumer understanding; and better ability to anticipate trends, driven by our investment in analytics; more resources for advertising, especially to digital advertising, which is increasing; better high-touch services online, as I explained before when there was the question on online; a brand portfolio, which is becoming stronger and stronger with the acquisition of DECIEM and Dr. Jart+; a huge investment and acceleration in every ESG activity during COVID. And all of this combined is what I call the new strengths that we are bringing to the party. 
So the way we see it is that the current drivers will drive. The new drivers, including makeup, will come back. And the new strengths that we've built in Estée Lauder Companies during this year will hit. And that's why we really believe that this quarter is just the confirmation that we are creating a very solid, long-term sustainable growth factor for the company."

I mean you noted this quarter that they are temporary, but also longer-term cost savings is substantially lower, operating costs in-store with the shift online, there's some subsidies in play. But you're also reallocating costs for the longer term from brick-and-mortar to online. Channel mix is obviously going to be a dynamic going forward. 
And I guess underlying the question is that margins continue to come through at a much higher level, channel mix is clearly an element. But there are some costs that have come out permanently, but also costs that are going to be coming back into the base. 
And so I guess getting back to it, I wonder how you view this fiscal '21 target. Do you think that you can move up from there with all the initiatives that you have noted? Or would you expect some sort of a step back as you weather some of these costs coming back in the base and channel mix evolving over the next year?"

So Chris, as you know, we typically give forward guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in August, which we will certainly do. I mean this has been an unusual year because of all of the things that you've mentioned. We had part of the year where we had temporary salary reductions. We've had furloughs. And we've also done a fantastic job, our teams have, in terms of managing costs. 
Some of those costs will come back next year, and some of them won't. Some of the door closures that we've permanently done, those costs and the remaining fleet of doors should be more productive as traffic continues to accelerate to brick and mortar, which is where we see bulk of the recovery. 
So given the cost actions that we've taken, given where we expect growth to come from next year disproportionately, we would expect continued margin progression, but we'll be able to say more specifically what that will be in the August time frame. But as we've said for many years, our growth areas are all margin accretive when you think about travel retail, when you think about online, when you think about the strength that we've had over multiple years in terms of skin care. And as Fabrizio said, we expect skin care and fragrance to continue to grow and makeup will also grow more strongly, certainly next year as those occasions come back. 
So we've got multiple engines, multiple ways to progress margin even as investments do come back for brick-and-mortar and in other areas. We will, in the fourth quarter, as you indicate and I said in my prepared remarks, so strongly invest as we normally do for a start of a strong fiscal year. And we will invest more in advertising to support what we believe will be an acceleration selectively in the markets that we think that it will happen in."

I hope you and your families are in good health, and our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. 
We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter and powered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees care for each other, their families and our company with compassion, creativity and resolve. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin fiscal year 2022 as a stronger company, full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow. 
For fiscal year 2021, sales rose 11% as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail in Asia/Pacific and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double digits, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variants of COVID-19 to the extent the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year. 
We saw reopenings revert to closing, and reopenings in one market meant with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter. 
Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skin care and fragrance. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 basis points above fiscal year 2019 as we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment. 
First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work toward our racial equity commitments. 
Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net 0 carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reduction target, addressing Scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of Scope 3 for our value chain, signaling our new level of ambition for climate actions. 
We launched [indiscernible] for 7 additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer this insightful content. We transformed our traditional inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience, with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including 4 antiracism and inclusive leadership. We expanded our [indiscernible] led employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the tumult of last year. 
The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global, with its expansion into Latin America and Asia/Pacific. We created 2 new leadership programs for women and black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique intensive course to develop our next generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the Open Doors Collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world. 
[indiscernible] leadership and development program is successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership trainings, mentorships, career development and advancement opportunity as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants. 
Our new partnership with [indiscernible] University focused on its alumina-hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training and self-empowering networking. 
Let me now turn to product innovation, which serve as an impactful catalyst for growth in fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combine data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends across categories. The Estée Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products, along with innovation, were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris and now Sao Paulo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil. 
Advanced Night Repair newly reformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supreme's new Supreme, Bright Moisturizer, further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while the Nutri new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand. 
In makeup, the brand's double wear [indiscernible] and pure [indiscernible] franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter and exciting early signs of makeup renaissance. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth in the fiscal year as innovation soared and engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient-based narratives drove demand for its hero products. 
The new [indiscernible] the La Mer Concentrated Night Balm proved highly sought-after and expanded the brand's Ulta luxury franchise as it both welcomed new consumers and captivated loyal consumers globally. 
Clinique skin care excelled in fiscal year 2021. Sales rose double digits and powered the brands to high single-digit sales growth. The brand successfully met consumer needs through the launch of Moisture Surge 100 Hour with its unique hydration benefits and target solution for hard-to-solve skin care problem like even better Clinical Interrupter. Clinique showcased its promise for makeup renaissance with stellar double-digit category growth in the fourth quarter with the new even better clinical serum foundation and even better consider capitalizing on its skin care authority. 
All told, our robust skin care portfolio from entry prestige to luxury and across subcategories is fulfilling the [indiscernible] needs around the world. Dr. Jart+ with its [indiscernible] derma brand positioning and hero products delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth in the second half of fiscal year 2021. In May, we amplified the strength of our skin care portfolio as we became a majority owner of DECIEM with its coated ingredient-based brand, The Ordinary, and emerging science-driven NIOD brand as part of its portfolio. 
Complementing skin care strength, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frédéric Malle in both established fragrance markets of the West and emerging fragrance market of the East. Tom Ford Beauty's private blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving strong repeat in markets newly embracing the category, with the brand's drag and sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year. 
The Asia/Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in fiscal year 2021 as annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22% led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia/Pacific's strengths. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolves with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia, particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered as we invested in its vibrancy of today, an opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence in specialty-multi, opened freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending. 
Skin care and fragrance sales grew strong double digit for the fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half. 
Our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of Tmall's 11 11 Global Shopping Festival and 6 18 Midyear Shopping Festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 6 18 among Tmall beauty flagship stores, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 in total beauty, while La Mer ranked first in luxury beauty and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market [indiscernible] online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographic by launching on JD in July. 
With international travel largely curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic travel retail development of [indiscernible] to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way given the island tremendous traffic growth and higher duty free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the in-store and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth. 
Looking at channels. Online strive globally in fiscal year 2021, characterized by strong double-digit sales gain and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was 2 years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com third-party platforms, retail.com and pure-play retailers delivered outstanding performance. 
During the year, brand.com came to epitomize the allure of a luxury flagship store for each brands, localized by market and reimagined with our classic high-touch services. We expanded virtual trainer, live streaming, omnichannel capabilities and consultations with our expert beauty advisers. Consumers at all ages explored, replenished and engaged in an immersive environment of entertainment and community. Our brands increasingly leveraged the exciting trends in social commerce by integrating with Instagram, WeChat, Snapchat and others. Estée Lauder launched on TikTok with the Night Done Right hashtag, driving nearly 12 billion views and the creation of almost 2 million videos. It challenge [indiscernible] diverse creators to educate a younger audience on how important is to take care of your skin at night, showcasing Advanced Night Repair. 
Clinique [indiscernible] campaigns on TikTok became a viral sensation, highlighting the brand acne solution and storing the creation of nearly 700,000 videos on the app. Together, these and other strategic actions delivered exceptional results for brand.com as new consumers, conversion, basket size, repeat and loyalty members grew considerably. Beyond the favorable growth rates, the direct relationship we fostered with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities. 
We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize prestige beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about having expanded our presence with pure-play retailers, which continued into the fourth quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China. 
For fiscal year 2022, we expect these growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail Asia/Pacific and global online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics, drive consumer acquisitions and retention, high-touch online services and robust innovation pipeline. 
Three compelling skin care innovation recently launched: Estée Lauder new Advanced Night Repair [indiscernible] is focused on lines in every eye zone, while La Mer dehydrating Infused Emotion is designed to replenish, strengthen and stabilize skin with [indiscernible] and has already proven to attract new consumers. Clinique smart clinical retail wrinkle correcting serum is designed to visibly reduce stubborn lines. 
Our Shanghai innovation center is expected to open in the second half of this fiscal year, enriching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estée Lauder [indiscernible] or Supreme Bright and La Mer, The Treatment Lotion. 
As the world emerge from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies and channels. 
Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines as our developed markets in the West and brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening and increase in socially professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeup started to improve to the end of fiscal year 2021 driven by our hero subcategories of foundation in mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of Magic Extension Mascara, Too Faced lip plumper, Smashbox [indiscernible] tinted moisturizer and Bobbi Brown [indiscernible]. Contributing to makeup emerging renaissance, M·A·C launched M·A·C The Moment, a campaign linking its makeup products and artists inspire trends to key experiences such as dead night parties, weddings and back-to-school shopping. 
Too Faced expanded into browse in July with a collection that includes an innovative brow gel that add color and texture. Similar to makeup, hair care is set to benefit from the rise of socially professional user education as well as salon reopenings. Aveda, which is now 100% vegan, and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum, owing to desirable innovation and rich consumer engagement from strong online performance globally over the past year. 
As makeup and hair care reunite, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the West and, over time, by emerging markets. 
In the United States, in the fourth quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and in-store activations as consumers returned to stores eager to explore beauty and experience high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty-multi and freestanding stores, our business in the United States prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations. 
As we start our new fiscal year, Bobbi Brown recently debuted in Ulta Beauty. Several of our brands launched online and in-store with Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta Beauty at Target. 
In closing, we leveraged the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy to elevate the company to new heights in fiscal year 2021. We did this while living our values with the health and well-being of our employees as primary focused and making important progress on our social impact commitment and sustainability goals. 
Our success and agility in operating amid the challenges of the past year give us confidence for fiscal year 2022 as we expect volatility and variability from the pandemic to persist for some time to come. 
This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a company and beginning our next 75 years incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility, and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the fiscal year while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability. 
We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year period. The inclusion of 6 weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the prepandemic levels of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skin care and fragrance categories, global online and travel retail in Asia. All 3 regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the quarter. 
Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong programs supporting recovery, new product launches and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remain below fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly $170 million in annual sales. 
Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recoup sales lost during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected. 
Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 65%, with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the quarter. 
Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international passenger traffic but grew strong double digits in the quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan, remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up, and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the quarter driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varies widely among the markets, and the resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double digits in the region driven by the successful 6 18 shopping festival campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, grew exceptionally against prior year brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year. 
Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales in fiscal 2019. 
Fragrance led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence, among Chinese consumers increasingly attracted to the category. Home, Bath & Body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and help to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to prepandemic levels in brick-and-mortar. And the brand's blossom and brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of [indiscernible] and the continued strength of [indiscernible]. 
Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estée Lauder saw strong growth of futurist and double wear foundations in Asia, and M·A·C liquid lip color and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed. 
Hair care net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of the Aveda's blown revival shampoo conditioner also contributed to category growth, adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda. 
Net sales in skin care continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer, Estée Lauder, Clinique and Dr. Jart+ brands, particularly in Asia. Skin care sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4 percentage points. 
Our gross margin improved 650 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations. 
Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic, and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation. 
We delivered operating income of $385 million for the quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth while effectively managing both costs and cash. 
The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skin care and fragrance categories and the momentum we drove in our online channels all supported our growth. 
Our distribution mix continued to evolve even as brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continue to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the travel retail channel grew, ending fiscal 2021 at 29% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, specialty-multi and perfumeries grew, while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year. 
Our gross margin rose 120 basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost for testers and stores, and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased, while advertising investments, primarily digital media, rose faster than sales to support our brands and the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the post-COVID business acceleration program, and this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorb some of the inflation in media and logistics costs as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic. 
Our full year operating margin was 18.9%, representing a 420 basis point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable onetime adjustment for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI tax regulations. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM. 
In fiscal 2021, we recorded $148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brand as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the post-COVID business acceleration program were $176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the onetime gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of $847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share. 
The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly, with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We are also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and [indiscernible]. These actions are expected to continue into fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested. 
We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized $637 million for capital improvement, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid $750 million of debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued $600 million of new long-term debt and retired $450 million of debt. We used $1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via increased dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activity in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic in brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly, and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business. 
Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic, and therefore, providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the fiscal year, caveated with the following underlying assumptions: progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mask-wearing abates in Western markets during the first half of the fiscal year; beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the fiscal year; the addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online; the inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions and in the skin care category; pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk in freight, media, labor and commodities; increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere. We forecast increasing benefits from our post-COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately $200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence and compensation. 
In addition to these assumptions, there are a few nonoperating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefit of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18, 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM, and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct the portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in fiscal 2022. 
Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected sales as we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America, increase investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our CapEx plan for the year also includes some spending deferred from last year. 
Also, beginning in fiscal 2022, we plan to introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations. Organic growth adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure such as acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business. 
Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on August 13 spot rates of 1 17 for the euro, 1.381 for the pound, 11 64 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to add 1 point to reported sales growth for the full fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. 
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. 
At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 points. 
Operating expenses are expected to rise in the first quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05, and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact. 
In closing, while we are cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estée Lauder Companies leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

But this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is -- continue to grow, and we expect this to continue to grow for many years to come, and the trend will not stop after COVID. Also our online mix, which is [indiscernible] in China, for example, which, as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying our last 18 6 event, was really strong. And then retail.com for many retailers around the world is booming, pure play, which is very much growing and then brand.com. And obviously, brand.com, in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment, there is the big reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease but then will start growing again. That's our expectation. 
So overall, all in all, our online business will continue to progress as a percentage of total business over the next years."

So we do have a robust technology investment that I would expect to continue over the next couple of years. We're also investing in new technology in our new facility in -- that is opening in a couple of years in Japan, and it will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. So it will leverage quite a bit of technology also."

Obviously, as we said in the prepared remarks, there's been some pandemic issues [indiscernible] places like Japan and some parts of Southeast Asia, which become an obstacle to this. So a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But overall, Asia/Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China whose progress we will continue to develop in our opinion. And also, that's what's happening so far. 
Now the -- what you call variability of sales, meaning up and downs of sales in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, frankly, it's more about seasonality. There is a clear seasonality like there is in the U.S., like there is in Europe. And there are holiday moments, Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which there are more [indiscernible] where the festivities and there are moments of the year where certain products, particularly in skin care, more used than others, obviously, there is important elements of seasonality. Now the good news, we are completely on top of those, and we manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter year programs are pretty well articulated and recognized consumer seasonality and trade [ promotionality ] period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue. That's why I will not call it variability but rather seasonality."

The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we are having on innovation and the kind of very attractiveness of our innovation, that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great grade quality that we are deploying to the consumers. And at the moment, you have between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our intent and the power of our innovation.

So it's all of a positive trend.

The proof that what will work happen in the U.S. in this last quarter is very encouraging. In this last quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong, for example, in countries where there was a recovery open in like the U.S. And we saw great results on M·A·C, on Too Faced and many other brands. And we saw particularly the recovery start from foundation and lipsticks, which is a very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is, first of all, we are preparing programs -- marketing programs and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we tie those to the expected recovery trend. They will be gradual, but we will be, as you know, will be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world, and we find our marketing action, our advertising relaunch actions, our innovation actions to the different expected recovery moments. So it's a pretty complex elaboration plan, but it's very effective, and so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on investment that we wanted when you time it correctly. 
The second thing that we are doing, obviously, is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and as I said, by makeup subcategories that are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the user education gets restated. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas. 
So all in all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China. And we are well organized to follow up on the recovery gradually in the course of 2022."

First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future, and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the come back to international travel. Let me explain that. If you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving toward the 15% from the information, which are available, and you assume that only a percentage of those consumers with the passport travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population. Hainan is domestic travel. So it's open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically goes well beyond international travel because it's domestic travel and appeals 100% of the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long term, that will continue to grow even when international travel will restart. 
As far as the international travel question, we are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our fiscal year -- '22 fiscal year. And this is obviously -- this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions and how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic. So it's -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we are currently estimating. And we have seen already some -- for example, in summer in Europe, we are seeing some new travels and new movements and some increase, but obviously, relatively still very much below what was before COVID.

If you think that the core investment that we have done has been in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online, and we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury experience services than in the past were only in the best department stores or in the best brick-and-mortar locations. So this now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business. Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in TR. It's been for since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now it's in Hainan where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world. And that's the key areas where we invest. 
We have also taken the opportunity where there is the opportunity to source from mass and to continue growing the prestige segment to bring some of our brands that have the power of sourcing from us closer to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop at once to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality. And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and the Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from us and further serve more consumers and consumers that we didn't access before with our best experience and best quality products."

I hope you and your families are in good health, and our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19.  We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exception",2462,"Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are in good health, and our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19.  
We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter and powered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees cared for each other, their families and our company with compassion, creativity and [ resolve ]. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin fiscal year 2022 as a stronger company, full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow.  
For fiscal year 2021, sales rose 11% as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail in Asia/Pacific and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double digits, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variants of COVID-19 to the extent the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year.  
We saw reopenings revert to closing, and reopenings in one market meant with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter.  
Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skin care and fragrance. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 basis points above fiscal year 2019 as we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities.  
Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment.  
First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work toward our racial equity commitments.  
Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net 0 carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reduction target, addressing Scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of Scope 3 for our value chain, signaling our new level of ambition for climate actions.  
We launched ingredient glossaries for 7 additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer this insightful content. We transformed our traditional inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience, with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including 4 antiracism and inclusive leadership. We expanded our [ growth road-led ] employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the tumult of last year.  
The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global, with its expansion into Latin America and Asia/Pacific. We created 2 new leadership programs for women and black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique intensive course to develop our next generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the Opening Doors collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world.  
[ The form ] every chair leadership and development program is successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership trainings, mentorships, career development and advancement opportunity as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants.  
Our new partnership with Howard University focused on its alumina-hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training and self-empowering networking.  
Let me now turn to product innovation, which serve as an impactful catalyst for growth in fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combine data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends across categories. The Estée Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products, along with innovation, were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris and now Sao Paulo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil.  
Advanced Night Repair newly reformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supreme's new Supreme+ Bright Moisturizer, further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while Re-Nutriv new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand.  
In makeup, the brand's double wear Futurist and pure Pure Color franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter and exciting early signs of makeup renaissance. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth in the fiscal year as innovation soared and engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient-based narratives drove demand for its hero products.  
The new Genaissance de la Mer Concentrated Night Balm proved highly sought-after and expanded the brand's ultra luxury franchise as it both welcomed new consumers and captivated loyal consumers globally.  
Clinique skin care excelled in fiscal year 2021. Sales rose double digits and powered the brands to high single-digit sales growth. The brand successfully met consumer needs through the launch of Moisture Surge 100 Hour with its unique hydration benefits and target solution for hard-to-solve skin care problem like Even Better Clinical Interrupter. Clinique showcased its promise for makeup renaissance with stellar double-digit category growth in the fourth quarter with the new Even Better Clinical serum foundation and Even Better concealer capitalizing on its skin care authority.  
All told, our robust skin care portfolio from entry prestige to luxury and across subcategories is fulfilling the [indiscernible] needs around the world. Dr. Jart+ with its [indiscernible] derma brand positioning and hero products delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth in the second half of fiscal year 2021. In May, we amplified the strength of our skin care portfolio as we became a majority owner of DECIEM with its coveted ingredient-based brand, The Ordinary, and emerging science-driven NIOD brand as part of its portfolio.  
Complementing skin care strength, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frédéric Malle in both established fragrance markets of the West and emerging fragrance market of the East. Tom Ford Beauty's private blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving strong repeat in markets newly embracing the category, with the brand's [ drag ] and sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year.  
The Asia/Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in fiscal year 2021 as annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22% led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia/Pacific's strengths. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolves with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia, particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered as we invested in its vibrancy of today, an opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence in specialty-multi, opened the freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending.  
Skin care and fragrance sales grew strong double digit for the fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half.  
Our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of Tmall's 11.11 Global Shopping Festival and 6.18 Mid-year Shopping Festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 6.18 among Tmall beauty flagship stores, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 in total beauty, while La Mer ranked first in luxury beauty and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market [indiscernible] online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographic by launching on JD in July.  
With international travel largely curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic travel retail development of Hainan [ island ] to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way given the island tremendous traffic growth and higher duty free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the in-store and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth.  
Looking at channels. Online strive globally in fiscal year 2021, characterized by strong double-digit sales gain and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was 2 years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com third-party platforms, retail.com and pure-play retailers delivered outstanding performance.  
During the year, brand.com came to epitomize the allure of a luxury flagship store for each brands, localized by market and reimagined with our classic high-touch services. We expanded virtual trainer, live streaming, omnichannel capabilities and consultations with our expert beauty advisers. Consumers at all ages explored, replenished and engaged in an immersive environment of entertainment and community. Our brands increasingly leveraged the exciting trends in social commerce by integrating with Instagram, WeChat, Snapchat and others. Estée Lauder launched on TikTok with the Night Done Right hashtag, driving nearly 12 billion views and the creation of almost 2 million videos. It challenge [indiscernible] diverse creators to educate a younger audience on how important is to take care of your skin at night, showcasing Advanced Night Repair.  
Clinique zit happens campaigns on TikTok became a viral sensation, highlighting the brand acne solution, [ exposing ] the creation of nearly 700,000 videos on the app. Together, these and other strategic actions delivered exceptional results for brand.com as new consumers, conversion, basket size, repeat and loyalty members grew considerably. Beyond the favorable growth rates, the direct relationship we fostered with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities.  
We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize prestige beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about having expanded our presence with pure-play retailers, which continued into the fourth quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China.  
For fiscal year 2022, we expect these growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail Asia/Pacific and global online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics, drive consumer acquisitions and retention, high-touch online services and robust innovation pipeline.  
Three compelling skin care innovation recently launched: Estée Lauder new Advanced Night Repair Eye Matrix is focused on lines in every eye zone, while La Mer The Hydrating Infused Emulsion is designed to replenish, strengthen and stabilize skin with healing moisture and has already proven to attract new consumers. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is designed to visibly reduce stubborn lines.  
Our Shanghai innovation center is expected to open in the second half of this fiscal year, enriching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estée Lauder Futurist Hydra or Supreme+ Bright and La Mer, The Treatment Lotion. 
As the world emerge from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure-play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies and channels. 
Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines as our developed markets in the West and brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening and increase in socially professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeup started to improve to the end of fiscal year 2021 driven by our hero subcategories of foundation and mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of MAC Magic Extension mascara, Too Faced lip plumper, Smashbox Halo tinted moisturizer and Bobbi Brown Sheer pressed powder. Contributing to makeup emerging renaissance, MAC launched MAC The Moment, a campaign linking its makeup products and artists inspire trends to key experiences such as dead night parties, weddings and back-to-school shopping. 
Too Faced expanded into browse in July with a collection that includes an innovative brow gel that add color and texture. Similar to makeup, hair care is set to benefit from the rise of socially professional user education as well as salon reopenings. Aveda, which is now 100% vegan, and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum, owing to desirable innovation and rich consumer engagement from strong online performance globally over the past year. 
As makeup and hair care reunite, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the West and, over time, by emerging markets. 
In the United States, the fourth quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and in-store activations as consumers returned to stores eager to explore beauty and experience high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty-multi and freestanding stores, our business in the United States prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations. 
As we start our new fiscal year, Bobbi Brown recently debuted in Ulta Beauty. Several of our brands launched online and in-store with Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta Beauty at Target. 
In closing, we leveraged the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy to elevate the company to new heights in fiscal year 2021. We did this while living our values with the health and well-being of our employees as primary focused and making important progress on our social impact commitment and sustainability goals. 
Our success and agility in operating amid the challenges of the past year give us confidence for fiscal year 2022 as we expect volatility and variability from the pandemic to persist for some time to come. 
This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a company and beginning our next 75 years incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility, and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the fiscal year while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability. 
We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year period. The inclusion of 6 weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the prepandemic levels of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skin care and fragrance categories, global online and travel retail in Asia. All 3 regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the quarter. 
Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong programs supporting recovery, new product launches and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remain below fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly $170 million in annual sales. 
Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recoup sales lost during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected. 
Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 65%, with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the quarter. 
Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international passenger traffic but grew strong double digits in the quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan, remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up, and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the quarter driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail. 
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varies widely among the markets, and the resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double digits in the region driven by the successful 6.18 Shopping Festival Campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, grew exceptionally against prior year brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year. 
Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales in fiscal 2019. 
Fragrance led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence and among Chinese consumers increasingly attracted to the category. Home, Bath & Body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and help to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to prepandemic levels in brick-and-mortar. And the brand's blossom and brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of Tubéreuse Nue and the continued strength of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick. 
Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estée Lauder saw strong growth of Futurist and double wear foundations in Asia, and MAC liquid lip color and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed. 
Hair care net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of the Aveda's blonde revival shampoo and conditioner also contributed to category growth, adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda. 
Net sales in skin care continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer, Estée Lauder, Clinique and Dr. Jart+ brands, particularly in Asia. Skin care sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4 percentage points. 
Our gross margin improved 650 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations. 
Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic, and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation. 
We delivered operating income of $385 million for the quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth while effectively managing both costs and cash. 
The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skin care and fragrance categories and the momentum we drove in our online channels all supported our growth. 
Our distribution mix continued to evolve even as brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continue to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the travel retail channel grew, ending fiscal 2021 at 29% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, specialty-multi and perfumeries grew, while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year. 
Our gross margin rose 120 basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost for testers and stores, and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased, while advertising investments, primarily digital media, rose faster than sales to support our brands and the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the post-COVID business acceleration program, and this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorb some of the inflation in media and logistics costs as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic. 
Our full year operating margin was 18.9%, representing a 420 basis point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable onetime adjustment for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI tax regulations. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM. 
In fiscal 2021, we recorded $148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brand as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the post-COVID business acceleration program were $176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the onetime gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of $847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share. 
The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly, with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We are also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and RODIN. These actions are expected to continue into fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested. 
We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized $637 million for capital improvement, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid $750 million of debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued $600 million of new long-term debt and retired $450 million of debt. We used $1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via increased dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activity in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic in brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly, and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business. 
Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic, and therefore, providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the fiscal year, caveated with the following underlying assumptions: progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mask-wearing abates in Western markets during the first half of the fiscal year; beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the fiscal year; the addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online; the inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions and in the skin care category; pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk in freight, media, labor and commodities; increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere. 
We forecast increasing benefits from our post-COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately $200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence and compensation. 
In addition to these assumptions, there are a few nonoperating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefit of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18, 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM, and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct the portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in fiscal 2022. 
Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected sales as we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America, increase investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our CapEx plan for the year also includes some spending deferred from last year. 
Also, beginning in fiscal 2022, we plan to introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations. Organic growth adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure such as acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business. 
Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on August 13 spot rates of 1 17 for the euro, 1.381 for the pound, 11 64 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to add 1 point to reported sales growth for the full fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. 
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. 
At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 points. 
Operating expenses are expected to rise in the first quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05, and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact. 
In closing, while we are cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estée Lauder Companies leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

But this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is -- continue to grow, and we expect this to continue to grow for many years to come, and the trend will not stop after COVID. Also our online mix, which is 3PP in China, for example, which, as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying our last 18.6 event, was really strong. And then retail.com for many retailers around the world is booming, pure-play, which is very much growing and then brand.com. And obviously, brand.com, in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment, there is the big reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease but then will start growing again. That's our expectation. 
So overall, all in all, our online business will continue to progress as a percentage of total business over the next years."

As it relates to technology, we are investing quite a bit in our e-commerce platform to enable capabilities, many of which we have spoken about, whether it's virtual try-on, our data analytics that certainly support are being able to more personalize experiences for consumers and many other capabilities and beyond online where we continue to invest in the consumer experience in our stores and in other areas as well.

So a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But overall, Asia/Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China whose progress we will continue to develop in our opinion. And also, that's what's happening so far. 
Now the -- what you call variability of sales, meaning up and downs of sales in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, frankly, it's more about seasonality. There is a clear seasonality like there is in the U.S., like there is in Europe. And there are holiday moments, Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which they are more home, moment where there are festivities and there are moments of the year where certain products, particularly in skin care, more used than others, obviously, there is important elements of seasonality. Now the good news, we are completely on top of those, and we manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter year programs are pretty well articulated and recognized consumer seasonality and trade promotionality period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue. That's why I will not call it variability but rather seasonality."

The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we are having on innovation and the kind of very attractiveness of our innovation, that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great grade quality that we are deploying to the consumers. And at the moment, you have between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our intent and the power of our innovation. So this is an extra flexibility that we have in terms of managing pricing over the years."

The proof that what [ will work happen ] in the U.S. in this last quarter is very encouraging. In this last quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong, for example, in countries where there was a recovery reopen like the U.S. And we saw great results on MAC, on Too Faced and many other brands. And we saw particularly the recovery start from foundation and lipsticks, which is a very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is, first of all, we are preparing programs -- marketing programs and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we tie those to the expected recovery trend. 
They will be gradual, but we will be, as you know, will be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world, and we find our marketing action, our advertising relaunch actions, our innovation actions to the different expected recovery moments. So it's a pretty complex elaboration plan, but it's very effective, and so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on investment that we wanted when you time it correctly. 
The second thing that we are doing, obviously, is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and as I said, by makeup subcategories that are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the user education gets restated. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas. 
So all in all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China. And we are well organized to follow up on the recovery gradually in the course of 2022."

First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future, and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the come back to international travel. Let me explain that. If you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving toward the 15% from the information, which are available, and you assume that only a percentage of those consumers with the passport travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population. Hainan is domestic travel. So it's open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically goes well beyond international travel because it's domestic travel and appeals 100% to the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long term, that will continue to grow even when international travel will restart. 
As far as the international travel question, we are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our fiscal year -- '22 fiscal year. And this is obviously -- this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions and how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic. So it's -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we are currently estimating. And we have seen already some -- for example, in summer in Europe, we are seeing some new travels and new movements and some increase, but obviously, relatively still very much below what was before COVID. And then in fiscal year 2023, we assume there will be a more robust international travel acceleration."

People are still shopping online. And certainly, the new retail partnerships of our retail partners, we are expecting, will also contribute to growth this year. But across the board, the team has really been working on terrific innovation. We're increasing advertising in North America in fiscal 2022.

And the other thing I want to say on travel retail on the long term, as I said, is the travel retail as this addition of the domestic travel in China, which is a very important additions. And so the development of the business with the Chinese consumers is extraordinary. And then the Chinese consumer, depending on the period of the year, their choices, some of them would travel, travel to Hainan, [ buy there ], others would buy in their cities. And so you will see this spending growth of the Chinese consumers in the China region or in the travel retail Hainan depending on what the Chinese consumer decide to do. 
Our strategy is very simple. We are going to serve the growing demand of Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop. And so we are online. We are in the outstanding quality department stores in China. We are in Hainan. And in all these areas where they shop, we tend to be present with outstanding execution, great luxury quality of services and to really give justice to our elevated luxury positioning in these positions. And that's the strategy to cover the Chinese consumer shopping. 
And as far as the when the international traveling will restart will obviously also cover the international travels in the best possible way. 
In terms of your second part of the question is -- I would like to clarify one thing. I think fiscal year 2021 was an extraordinary year to build our luxury position and to elevate our consumer expression in a very luxury way. If you think that the core investment that we have done has been in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online, and we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury experience services than in the past were only in the best department stores or in the best brick-and-mortar locations. So this now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business. Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in [ TR ]. It's been for since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now it's in Hainan where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world. And that's the key areas where we invest. 
We have also taken the opportunity where there is the opportunity to source from [ us ] and to continue growing the prestige segment to bring some of our brands that have the power of sourcing from [ us ] closer to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop at once to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality. And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and the Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from us and further serve more consumers and consumers that we didn't access before with our best experience and best quality products."

We delivered excellent performance to begin fiscal year 2022, reinforcing our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow as we discussed with you in August. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to excel amid continued volatility and variability from the pandemic. Organic sales rose 18%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew an even stronger 31%. Encouragingly, relative to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020, our business is 13% larger on a reported basis and more profitable. 
We achieved these outstanding results with increasingly diverse growth engines as we expected. By virtue of our dynamic strategy, we could act locally amid the complexity of the pandemic to both create and capture demand. The growth engines of makeup, developed markets in the West, and brick-and-mortar reignited and complemented momentum in skincare, fragrance, Mainland China, Travel Retail in Asia Pacific and global online. 
13 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth, demonstrating the breadth of strength across our portfolio. Estée Lauder and MAC drove makeup emerging renaissance, while La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care. Impressively, skin care solidly outpaced its prior year organic sales growth performance despite having the far toughest comparison among the categories. fragrance showed double digits, driven by Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London.
Let me share a few highlights by brand. Estée Lauder advanced planning for the makeup renaissance delivered significant sales growth. As social and professional usage occasion resumed in certain markets, the brand was well positioned with compelling innovation, superb merchandising and on point communication. It's Double Wear and Futurist foundation franchises rose strong double digits, while its new pure color Whipped Matte lipstick was a hit. 
MAC strategically engaged consumers to drive performance in makeup. In the Americas and EMEA, excellent results from in-store activations and regional MAC the Moment campaigns combined with desirable innovation like Luster Glass sheer Shine Lipstick and Magic Extension Mascara. The brand's new omnichannel capabilities, which leverage its freestanding stores, also contributed to the strength and demonstrate a new capability for MAC to benefit from going forward. 
La Mer performed magnificent and led the company with sales rising strong double digits. Its new hydrating infused emulsion expanded our portfolio of East to West innovation. captivating consumers in every region. The product successes are many as it welcomed new and younger consumers as well as men into the brand and created a powerful halo benefit for La Mer's skin care portfolio. It is a striking example of the innovation gains we can achieve when the power of our data analytics combined with our creative talent and R&D. La Mer's iconic Creme de la Mer prospered as a new global campaign focused on its moisturizing benefit realized terrific initial results. 
Clinique strived in skin care from the strength of its Heroes. Moreover, its new Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum with powerful clinically-led claims and compelling before-and-after visualizations extended Clinique win streak with innovation and further demonstrated the brand ability to be highly relevant for consumers of all ages. In makeup, Clinique Skin Care Authority drove growth in complexion-led subcategories; while in Leap, the brand Brilliant leverage Black Honey viral sensation on TikTok to expand its consumer base, especially among Gen Z. 
DECIEM complemented our organic sales growth in skin care with its coveted vegan brand, The Ordinary. DECIEM is known for its transparency, which has enamored it with consumers. And in the first quarter, we launched the insightful Everything is Chemicals campaign. And the new Regimen Builder by The Ordinary on brand.com realized spectacular adoption, further enhancing the brand powerful online ecosystem. 
Fragrance momentum continued with stellar double-digit performance in every region, powered by hero products and innovation from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London in our artisanal offerings. We are excited for the Estée Lauder brand launch of its luxury collection in the second quarter as it expands our portfolio in the high-growth segment of fragrances. Our fragrance category benefits from diversification amongst our categories as well as regions with outstanding performance from both historically strong markets for fragrance and emerging fragrance opportunities. The self-care rituals related to scent, which were embraced during the pandemic, continued even as social and professional usage occasion resumed. Of note, Tom Ford Beauty performed strongly in both fragrance and makeup. such that the brand was among our top performers in the quarter. Its new Ombre Leather perfume and hero's Oud Wood and Lost Cherry fueled the brand's success. 
Our growth engines also diversified geographically, led by developed markets in the West. Our business in North America executed with excellence to deliver strong double-digit organic sales growth, powered by readiness for makeup's emerging renaissance, ongoing strength in skincare and fragrance, and recovery in hair care. Strategic go-to-market initiatives supported by on-trend innovation, increased advertising spending, and expert in-store virtual services delighted consumers. Our expanded consumer reach enhanced these initiatives as Bobbi Brown launched in Ulta Beauty exceeded expectation, and we are encouraged by the early results of the new Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's relationships. 
In Asia Pacific, many markets faced COVID-induced lockdowns and temporary store closures, which pressured performance. Despite this, the region still grew 10% organically driven by strength in Greater China and Korea. Mainland China achieved double-digit organic sales growth owing to skin care and fragrance, with online and brick-and-mortar both higher. We launched locally relevant innovation which proved highly desirable, while we also increased advertising spending, strategically expanded our consumer reach to match success on JD, and designed successful activation for Chinese Valentine's Day. 
We continue to invest in the vibrant and compelling long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, led by our talented local team. We are enthusiastic for our new innovation center in Shanghai to open in the second half of this fiscal year. This new world-class innovation center will be the first of its kind for our company. With it, we will have a unique ability to grow and build on our market and consumer insights to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of Chinese consumers. What is more, we are seeing the benefits of recent investment in online fulfillment, which have led to higher service levels and better inventory manager while setting the stage for expanded omnichannel capabilities in the market. 
From a channel perspective globally, brick-and-mortar grew strongly in markets which are gradually emerging from the latest wave of COVID-19. We realized excellent results across the board in brick-and-mortar, most especially in the Americas and EMEA. Our brands created excitement in store with enticing high-touch services and unique activations. We are encouraged by improving trends in the productivity of brick-and-mortar, owing to both increased traffic and our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program. 
As brick-and-mortar reignites, our global online business continued to showcase its tremendous promise, with impressive organic results despite significant organic sales growth in the year-ago period. Online grew to be nearly double the size, on a reported basis, of the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Many markets capitalized on the remarkable new consumer acquisition trend of the pandemic to deliver sustained gain in repeat purchases. 
As we seek to engage with consumers in innovative ways, we advanced our work with Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, WeChat and others to capitalize on exciting trends in social commerce. We also deployed a technology solution, which enables brands to better customize consumer outreach by leveraging data to merchandise and personalized communication. This is leading to higher conversion rates for new consumers and a deeper level of relationship building after the initial purchase to foster retention. Initiatives such as this position us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. 
We continued to invest in online to strategically expand our consumer reach and realize promising results. For example, in the first quarter, La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia to tremendous success with differentiated merchandising, unique services and prestige packaging, making it one of the platform's biggest brand launches ever. Our relationship with Lazada expanded in the current quarter with Jo Malone London debut.
Before I close, I wanted to share that today we will release our fiscal year 2021 Social Impact and Sustainability Report. We are incredibly inspired by the achievements of our employees globally. The report highlights initiatives across key areas, including inclusion, diversity and equity. climate, packaging, social investment, responsible sources and green chemistry. 
I'm particularly proud of our support to employees globally who faced financial hardships due to COVID-19. The ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund awarded nearly 14,000 grants and distributed nearly $8 million through June 30, 2021. 
Here, a few among the many other highlights of the report: We are continuing to contribute to a low-carbon future. For the second year in a row, we sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations and achieved net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. The company also made strong progress in its Science-based Targets for scope 1 and 2 and made efforts towards meeting its scope 3 science-based targets. 
We achieved our existing post-consumer recycled content goal ahead of schedule and announced a more ambitious goal to increase the amount of such material in our packaging to 25% or more by the end of calendar year 2025. We also committed to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum plastic in our packaging to 50% or less by the end of calendar year 2030.
On the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we are taking to make more progress on our commitments for racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are reflected in the report. We also deepened our work by further aligning the strategy of The Estee Lauder Companies' charitable foundation to identify and support programs at the intersection of climate, justice, human rights and well-being with a focus on equity, building upon our legacy of founding girls' education and leadership programs. 
In the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and aligned with our social impact commitments, we were pleased to announce a 3-year partnership with Amanda Gorman, activist, award-winning writer and the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history. The Estée Lauder Companies will contribute over 3 years to support Writing Change, a special initiative to advance literacy as a pathway to equality, access and social change. In addition, Mrs. Gorman will bring her Voice of Change to the Estée Lauder brand, debuting her first campaign in the second half of this fiscal year.
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance to begin the new fiscal year amid the volatility and variability of the pandemic, while continuing to invest in sustainable long-term growth drivers. We are focusing on fundamental capabilities for product quality and the consumer-centric elements of acquisition, engagement and high-touch experiences and services. We are doing this while improving our cost structure, diversifying our portfolio and its distribution, investing behind the best growth opportunities and leading our values. Our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our company is reflected in the announcement today to raise the quarterly dividend. I'm forever grateful to the grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employees globally, who are making us a stronger company each and every day.
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

We are off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically, driven by the nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the p",1590,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. We are off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically, driven by the nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the prior year. Global logistics constraints caused some retailers, primarily in North America, to order earlier to ensure popular sets and products would be on counter for holiday. We estimate that this contributed approximately 1.5 points to our first quarter sales growth that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 3 points to reported net sales growth, and currency added just over 2 points. 
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas climbed 27% as COVID restrictions eased throughout the region. Brick-and-mortar retail grew sharply across all formats compared to the prior year period when many stores were temporarily shut down. Distribution in Kohl's with Sephora and in Target with Ulta Beauty began its phased rollout to initial stores and online in mid-August, with minimal impact on net sales growth for the quarter. With the strong resurgence of brick-and-mortar traffic, online organic sales growth in the Americas declined single digits against a sharp increase last year, while organic online penetration remained solid at 31% of sales. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 9 points to the overall reported growth in the region. 
In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 19% with virtually every market contributing to growth, led by the emerging markets in the Middle East, Turkey and Russia as well as the U.K. Most markets throughout the region saw COVID restrictions lifted, and some tourism resumed during the peak summer months. By channel, the region saw more balance between brick-and-mortar and online growth. All major categories grew this quarter, and the region saw the strongest growth in fragrance and makeup as social occasions increased. 
Our global Travel Retail business grew double-digit as China and Korea continue to be strong. Internal travel restrictions during the quarter in China slowed Hainan sales temporarily, but restrictions lifted in early September and traffic rebounded. Retailers also responded to the August dip by driving post-travel consumption online. Summer holiday travel in Europe and the Americas picked up, but international travel still reached only 40% of pre-COVID levels. 
In our Asia Pacific region, organic net sales rose 10%, driven by Greater China and Korea. The region overall experienced higher levels of COVID lockdowns this quarter compared to last year's quarter due to the rise of the Delta variant, although online remains strong. Sales growth in Mainland China was somewhat slower due to COVID restrictions during July and August. And the pace of online sales growth slowed following the successful 6.18 programs last quarter and in anticipation of the 11.11 shopping festival. As we've mentioned before, these key shopping moments have created some additional seasonality in our business in this region. More than half of our brands in virtually all channels rose double-digit in Mainland China. 
Hong Kong and Macau were bright spots this quarter. They benefited from strong new product launches from La Mer and Jo Malone and successful marketing campaigns from several other brands. 
From a category perspective, net sales growth in fragrance jumped nearly 50%. Virtually every brand that participates in the category contributed to growth, with exceptional double-digit increases from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and [ La Lebou ]. Perfumes and colognes led the category growth; and bath, body and home fragrances continue to perform well. 
Net sales in makeup rose 18% as markets in the Americas and Europe began to recover from COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in makeup versus pre-COVID levels. However, makeup sales in the quarter were still 19% below 2 years ago. Nonetheless, Estée Lauder foundations continue to resonate strongly with consumers, and MAC leaned into the makeup recovery with a number of fun and compelling campaigns. 
Skin care sales remained strong during the quarter. Organic net sales grew 12%, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 6 percentage points to reported growth. Nearly all of our skin care brands contributed to growth, although Estée Lauder had a tough comparison with the prior year launch of its improved Advanced Night Repair Serum. 
Our hair care net sales rose 8% as traffic in salons and stores in the U.S. and Europe began to return. Both Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw growth in hero products as well as continued strength from innovation. 
Our gross margin declined 100 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing and currency were more than offset by higher obsolescence costs for both basic and holiday product sets and the inclusion of DECIEM. 
Operating expenses decreased 240 basis points as a percent of sales. Our strong sales growth was partly due to earlier orders from some North America retailers concerned about logistics constraints, and costs related to these sales are expected to be incurred in our second quarter. 
We do continue to manage costs with agility, realizing savings from our cost initiatives, while also investing to support a continued brick-and-mortar recovery as well as our strategic initiatives. Our operating income rose 32% to $941 million, and our operating margin rose 140 basis points to 21.4% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.89 increased 31% compared to the prior year. 
During the quarter, we used $81 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year. This reflects a more normalized first quarter where we typically have seasonally higher working capital needs. We invested $205 million in capital expenditures as we ramped up our investment to build a new manufacturing facility in Japan. And we returned $749 million in cash to stockholders through both share repurchases and dividends. We also announced this morning an increase in our quarterly dividend.
So now let's turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing around the world, even in the context of an environment of increased volatility. Our strong performance reflects our ability to navigate through the volatility while leveraging our multiple engines of growth. At the same time, we are mindful that recovery is tenuous and likely to be uneven. Nevertheless, we are cautiously optimistic, and our assumptions for fiscal 2022 remain consistent. 
We continue to expect an emerging renaissance in the makeup category as restrictions are safely lifted and social occasions increase. We welcome the resumption of some travel in the Americas and EMEA in the first quarter. And as intercontinental restrictions are lifted, we expect international passenger traffic to build toward the end of the fiscal year. 
We began taking strategic pricing actions in July. And overall, pricing is expected to add at least 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary pressures.
On the costs side, we plan to continue to increase advertising to support our brands and drive traffic in all channels. Selling costs are expected to rise to support the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail. We also continue to invest behind key strategic capabilities like data analytics, innovation, technology and sustainability initiatives. 
As you are all aware, global supply chains are being strained by COVID and its related effects in some markets, resulting in port congestion, higher fuel costs and labor shortages at a time when demand for goods is rising. This is causing us to experience inflation in freight and procurement, which we expect to impact our cost of goods and operating expenses beginning next quarter. 
Based on what we see through October, the expected benefit of pricing, combined with good cost discipline elsewhere, are enabling us to maintain our expectations for the year. 
For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on rates of 1.163 for the euro, 1.351 for the pound and 6.471 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full fiscal year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. 
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.04 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise 11% to 14%. 
At this time, we expect organic sales for our second quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. 
Operating expenses are expected to rise in the second quarter as we support holiday activations and the continued recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world. Additionally, the prior year quarter included some benefit of government subsidies, which are not anticipated in the current year quarter. 
We expect second quarter EPS of $2.51 to $2.61. Both currency and the inclusion of DECIEM are expected to be immaterial to EPS. Notably, our EPS forecast also reflects a 23% tax rate compared to 15.9% in the prior year when we benefited from certain onetime items.
In closing, we are pleased with the terrific start to the year and are proud of the continued efforts of our global team. We remain confident in our corporate strategy with its multiple growth engines to drive sustainable, profitable growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Our holiday sets, we had anticipated some of the supply chain challenges earlier in the year when clearly our chain, and more publicly there were discussions about supply chain challenges. And so we did order some products early. We produced some products early, and we landed many of our gift sets early. And that set us up pretty well for Q2. 
So we are experiencing some inflation in transport. We're managing it as best we can. One of the things that certainly we have the benefit of is we are a luxury company, so we do have pricing power. And we have pricing power not only in our in-line products but also in our innovation as well. So we do have the opportunity and have taken the opportunity to offset some of the cost inflation with some of the pricing that we've taken this year."

We were encouraged at the end of last year and encouraged through the first quarter with MAC performance in both the Americas, so both North America as well as Latin America and also EMEA. So we really, with a return to brick-and-mortar as we had indicated before, we saw higher productivity of the remaining brick-and-mortar doors that we had opened. And we saw a bit of softness more in North America than in EMEA, but a bit of softness in online as traffic returned to brick-and-mortar. We think that will normalize out a bit in Q2, and we'll see a bit more balance. But as I think all of us can imagine, I think consumers are very excited about going back to brick-and-mortar stores in markets where restrictions were lifted and people felt more comfortable going out and socializing."

And then also, Fabrizio, if you think about what happened during the pandemic as consumers were migrating to well-known brands, exploration kind of came down a bit. But I suspect that that's starting to happen now as consumers are getting back out and exploring different brands. 
I just wanted to get your perspective on that dynamic, if that's what you're seeing? And how does Estée better prepare in the future to deal with all of these upstart brands that are starting up on social media?"

On a 2-year stack, we doubled it. And so is a very strong acceleration versus 2 years. And we see the progress to continue and the growth to continue. Obviously, in the moment where there was the opening of brick-and-mortar, the amount of growth online has slowed down, but the continuous growth is what is really encouraging. 
So the most important part of your question is what happened to the consumers' behavior. So what we saw during COVID that the consumers that were already online before, like younger consumer, continue to be online even more intensively. But there were many new consumers that just appeared online during the COVID period. There were more the ageless consumer, the more adult consumers. Now this consumer really enjoyed it, so they are staying online. And so that's what showed that the online continues to grow even when brick-and-mortar opens up. But obviously, the 2 channels' growth get rebalanced in this situation. So very optimistic for online.
The other thing that online continues to grow is that there are very different channels with level -- different level of growth. And we are growing in every single channel. And we are growing in TPP. We are growing in brand.com. We are growing in retail.com. We are growing in the pure plays. And this is very different by region because in every region, one of this channel is stronger than the others. 
So the combination of the global online growth is continued to be pretty exciting. And we count on this to continue even when brick-and-mortar will be fully recovered. And as a result, we have reached already 28% of our business in online, and this will gradually continue to grow over time. So very very strong.
In terms of -- sorry, your second question, because it was a separate question, on consumer behaviors in Asia?"

You mentioned some green shoots. Obviously, a makeup recovery, Americas recovery. Asia, some softness with some of the government lockdowns in third quarter, but it sounded like that's getting better. 
And so I'm just trying to understand unchanged local currency top line guidance for the year. Is there something specific that's giving you more caution as you look at the balance of the year? Is it more just some conservatism, given it's early in the year? How do you sort of think about that relative to the Q1 top line delivery and some green shoots?

So in terms of -- we are encouraged obviously, as we should be, by our Q1 performance. We're still only a quarter in, as you mentioned it. We did have some early shipments in the quarter that obviously came out of the second quarter. So some of the growth as we mentioned, about 1.5 points was related to that. 
But as we look at the balance of the year, we are also while we are seeing encouragement, there's still a lot of volatility in the market. We did have some markets unexpectedly that were shut down in the first quarter. We are still managing through this pandemic. 
And so we are -- we believe that certainly as you look at Q2 on a 2-year stack basis, it is -- and really versus pre-pandemic, it's really quite strong. And again, you're seeing some of the seasonality related to 11.11 continue to impact Q1. And that's reflected in the Q2 and that's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. 
But we feel that the guidance that we've given for the year is incredibly strong. The only difference between the guidance that we gave last time and this time is currency. Our outlook on currency is a bit less. So that's the 1 point change in the guidance that you see. And then from a reported EPS standpoint, our guidance actually on a constant currency basis has improved quite a bit. 
So we I would say we are seeing green shoots. We are expressing confidence in the guidance that we are providing, quite a bit when you actually look at it from a EPS standpoint, even with all of the things that we're navigating through as it relates to transport, et cetera. And that goes to the choices that we're making as an organization in terms of where to invest and where not to invest, along with the pricing actions that we're taking as well."

So we feel very good about that.
In terms of Asia Pacific, inclusive of China but other markets as well, we did see intermittent shutdowns in Asia. And that did include some traffic to Hainan being a bit curtailed in the July and August time frame and a bit into the early part of September. We saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Hainan pick up quite a bit when those travel restrictions were lifted almost immediately. So that is a positive sign.

The other interesting thing is during COVID the element of our fragrance brands that were, for example, home like candles, our personal lines pampering parts of the lineup beyond the fragrance also was accelerating.

Also skin care, which I think is a great sign of strength. skin care grew strong double-digit despite the very tough comparison with previous year, where in our case we launched the Advanced Navitaire relaunch. So it was a very big innovation in the base period. So brick-and-mortar in China also saw very strong growth. 
And our business online grew double digit, despite the fact that in quarter 1, online is a bit normally sandwiched between the 6.18 big event and the 11.11 big events. But despite that, we grew double digit. 
And the long-term fundamentals of the market in closing, namely the large and growing middle class with increasing spending per person, the remaining all these remain intact. And so the key idea is to be able to focus on the Chinese consumer in whatever channel they choose to shop at depending on the moment of the year.

So what we are learning is also the power of creative incubation and the creation of new brands. And this will have an influence on our future ability to continue developing brands. And definitely, we will leverage the strength of DECIEM also in this area."

And I think you had mentioned this on some previous calls in terms of where the growth is coming from, meaning that you weren't necessarily sourcing it from sales in the mainland. I guess I'm curious if that's still the case and kind of how you think about what has driven the growth? Especially as it seems like some of the duty-free operators are paying the duties to deliver product to mainland customers. So if that's true, kind of how do you think this all plays out in time in terms of having mainland and Hainan or kind of local duty-free work together?"
207221,685664866,2421225,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Yes. I mean keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estée Lauder, is on 140 cities. Where today with a strong social media and with a strong aspiration of values of our brand, as we speak, we can -- we have demand in more than 70",444,"Yes. I mean keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estée Lauder, is on 140 cities. Where today with a strong social media and with a strong aspiration of values of our brand, as we speak, we can -- we have demand in more than 700 cities. 
So there are many, many consumers in China that can only buy either online or traveling, and traveling domestically today and historically also traveling internationally. And so it's just the market, the -- commercially, the market is designed to have a very limited overlap between the Mainland China and the Hainan. 
Hainan serves an enormous amount of consumer that comes also from tier 3, tier 4 cities, areas where there is not a lot of brick-and-mortar distribution. And so Hainan can attract this consumer in this moment. Also is a place where people go for holidays. As part of these holidays, there is a lot of the pleasure of shopping, the pleasure of discovery. 
So the business in Hainan is proving to be a great trial builder more than in a cannibalizing business. And it's building trial of people that otherwise will not be able to trial our product, then will repurchase them. Will repurchase them maybe again in the future travel, but most of the times in their everyday life in Mainland China. 
So obviously, there is commercial competition. The market is becoming very competitive. There is a lot of players. Commercially, the region will continue to be intense competition. But there is every channel that serves frankly, a very different role. And so our strategy is to be able to leverage each one of this channel in the best possible way, with the idea of maximizing the coverage and the service to the total consumers in China that are interested in beauty, and over time to be able to better differentiate the scope of the channels and how the consumer will be served by the different channels. 
Last thing I want to say, Hainan had, at least the last number I've seen, over the 80 million visitors in the last year. So if you think that Hainan serves the entire middle class. Because it's domestic travel, you don't need to have a passport. So today is our knowledge about 12% to Chinese consumer had a passport. Even when international travel will restart, there will be even limited cannibalization versus international travel, because Hainan will serve many consumers that do not plan to travel internationally. So we are very positive on the long term and very positive on the ability to serve the consumers using different channels, which is our strategy."

So that's my first question. 
And then second thing, I know you said, Tracey, that there was only minimal sales in the first quarter from the pipeline fill into Target and Kohl's. But now that we're kind of already into November, can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing there? And especially I'm curious, what percentage of the sales that you're getting from Target and Kohl's are in makeup as opposed to skin?

We certainly expect during the upcoming holiday season that we will see increased growth, obviously, in contribution from the distribution that we have. And we're pleased thus far with the partnership.

Also, we've been gaining shares in all categories during the quarter in Clinique, in MAC, La Mer, in Bobbi, in Tom Ford, in Jo Malone. So it's a very broad growth across. We are really ready with our innovation with the strong marketing programs. We had anticipated the comeback on makeup. We have strengthened our program in what we call the makeup renaissance in anticipation on the return to back to school or back to work. We had amazing programs so that -- we have added obviously The Ordinary, which is the #4 brand in skin care in prestige U.S. to our portfolio. 
So it's a combination of factors of improvement of the strategy and improvement of the execution in our North American organization, so a terrific quarter.

We delivered excellent performance to begin fiscal year 2022, reinforcing our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow as we discussed with you in August. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to excel amid continued volatility and variability from the pandemic.  
Organic sales rose 18%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew an even stronger 31%. Encouragingly, relative to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020, our business is 13% larger on a reported basis and more profitable.  
We achieved these outstanding results with increasingly diverse growth engines as we expected. By virtue of our dynamic strategy, we could act locally amid the complexity of the pandemic to both create and capture demand. The growth engines of makeup, developed markets in the West, and brick and mortar reignited and complemented momentum in skincare, fragrance, Mainland China, Travel Retail in Asia Pacific and global online.  
13 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth, demonstrating the breadth of strength across our portfolio. Estee Lauder and MAC drove makeup emerging renaissance, while La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care. Impressively, skin care solidly outpaced its prior year organic sales growth performance despite having the far toughest comparison among the categories. fragrance showed double digits, driven by Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London. 
Let me share a few highlights by brand. Estée Lauder advanced planning for the makeup renaissance delivered significant sales growth. As social and professional usage occasion resumed in certain markets, the brand was well positioned with compelling innovation, superb merchandising and on point communication. It's Double Wear and Futurist foundation franchises rose strong double digits, while its new pure color Whipped Matte lipstick was a hit. MAC strategically engaged consumers to drive performance in makeup. In the Americas and EMEA, excellent results from in-store activations and regional MAC The Moment campaigns combined with desirable innovation like Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick and Magic Extension Mascara. The brand's new omnichannel capabilities, which leverage its freestanding stores, also contributed to the strength and demonstrate a new capability for MAC to benefit from going forward.  
La Mer performed [ magnificant ] and led the company with sales rising strong double digits. Its new The Hydrating Infused Emulsion expanded our portfolio of East to West innovation captivating consumers in every region. The product successes are many as it welcomed new and younger consumers as well as men into the brand and created a powerful halo benefit for La Mer's skin care portfolio. It is a striking example of the innovation gains we can achieve when the power of our data analytics combined with our creative talent and R&D. La Mer's iconic Crème de la Mer prospered as a new global campaign focused on its moisturizing benefit realized terrific initial results.  
Clinique strived in skin care from the strength of its Heroes. Moreover, its new Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum with powerful clinically-led claims and compelling before-and-after visualizations extended Clinique win streak with innovation and further demonstrated the brand ability to be highly relevant for consumers of all ages. In makeup, Clinique Skin Care Authority drove growth in complexion-led subcategories; while in [ lip ], the brand Brilliant leverage Black Honey viral sensation on TikTok to expand its consumer base, especially among Gen Z.  
DECIEM complemented our organic sales growth in skin care with its coveted vegan brand, The Ordinary. DECIEM is known for its transparency, which has enamored it with consumers. And in the first quarter, we launched the insightful Everything is Chemicals campaign. And the new Regimen Builder by The Ordinary on brand.com realized spectacular adoption, further enhancing the brand powerful online ecosystem.  
Fragrance momentum continued with stellar double-digit performance in every region, powered by hero products and innovation from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London in our artisanal offerings. We are excited for the Estee Lauder brand launch of its luxury collection in the second quarter as it expands our portfolio in the high-growth segment of fragrances. Our fragrance category benefits from diversification amongst our categories as well as regions with outstanding performance from both historically strong markets for fragrance and emerging fragrance opportunities. The self-care rituals related to scent, which were embraced during the pandemic, continued even as social and professional usage occasion resumed. Of note, Tom Ford Beauty performed strongly in both fragrance and makeup. such that the brand was among our top performers in the quarter. Its new Ombre Leather perfume and hero's Oud Wood and Lost Cherry fueled the brand's success.  
Our growth engines also diversified geographically, led by developed markets in the West. Our business in North America executed with excellence to deliver strong double-digit organic sales growth, powered by readiness for makeup's emerging renaissance, ongoing strength in skincare and fragrance, and recovery in hair care. Strategic go-to-market initiatives supported by on-trend innovation, increased advertising spending, and expert in-store virtual services delighted consumers. Our expanded consumer reach enhanced these initiatives as Bobbi Brown launched in Ulta Beauty exceeded expectation, and we are encouraged by the early results of the new Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's relationships.  
In Asia Pacific, many markets faced COVID-induced lockdowns and temporary store closures, which pressured performance. Despite this, the region still grew 10% organically driven by strength in Greater China and Korea. Mainland China achieved double-digit organic sales growth owing to skin care and fragrance, with online and brick-and-mortar both higher. We launched locally relevant innovation which proved highly desirable, while we also increased advertising spending, strategically extended our consumer reach to match success of JD, and designed successful activation for Chinese Valentine's Day.  
We continue to invest in the vibrant and compelling long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, led by our talented local team. We are enthusiastic for our new innovation center in Shanghai to open in the second half of this fiscal year. This new world-class innovation center will be the first of its kind for our company. With it, we will have a unique ability to grow and build on our market and consumer insights to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of Chinese consumers. What is more, we are seeing the benefits of recent investment in online fulfillment, which have led to higher service levels and better inventory manager while setting the stage for expanded omnichannel capabilities in the market.  
From a channel perspective globally brick-and-mortar grew strongly in markets which are gradually emerging from the latest wave of COVID-19. We realized excellent results across the board in brick and mortar, most especially in the Americas and EMEA. Our brands created excitement in store with enticing high-touch services and unique activations. We are encouraged by improving trends in the productivity of brick and mortar, owing to both increased traffic and our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program.  
As brick-and-mortar reignites, our global online business continued to showcase its tremendous promise, with impressive organic results despite significant organic sales growth in the year-ago period. Online grew to be nearly double the size, on a reported basis, of the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Many markets capitalized on the remarkable new consumer acquisition trend of the pandemic to deliver sustained gain in repeat purchases.  
As we seek to engage with consumers in innovative ways, we advanced our work with Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, WeChat and others to capitalize on exciting trends in social commerce. We also deployed a technology solution, which enables brands to better customize consumer outreach by leveraging data to merchandise and personalized communication. This is leading to higher conversion rates for new consumers and a deeper level of relationship building after the initial purchase to foster retention. Initiatives such as this position us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat.  
We continued to invest in online to strategically extend our consumer reach and realize promising results. For example, In the first quarter, La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia to tremendous success with differentiated merchandising, unique services, and prestige packaging, making it one of the platform's biggest brand launches ever. Our relationship with Lazada expanded in the current quarter with Jo Malone London debut. 
Before I close, I wanted to share that today we will release our fiscal year 2021 Social Impact and Sustainability Report. We are incredibly inspired by the achievements of our employees globally. The report highlights initiatives across key areas, including inclusion, diversity and equity, climate, packaging, social investment, responsible sources and green chemistry.  
I'm particularly proud of our support to employees globally who faced financial hardships due to COVID-19. The ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund awarded nearly 14,000 grants and distributed nearly $8 million through June 30, 2021.  
Here, a few among the many other highlights of the report: We are continuing to contribute to a low-carbon future. For the second year in a row, we sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations and achieved net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. The company also made strong progress in its Science-based Targets for scope 1 and 2 and made efforts towards meeting its scope 3 science-based targets.  
We achieved our existing post-consumer recycled content goal ahead of schedule and announced a more ambitious goal to increase the amount of such material in our packaging to 25% or more by the end of calendar year 2025. We also committed to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum plastic in our packaging to 50% or less by the end of calendar year 2030. 
On the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we are taking to make more progress on our commitments for racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are reflected in the report. We also deepened our work by further aligning the strategy of The Estee Lauder Companies' charitable foundation to identify and support programs at the intersection of climate, justice, human rights and well-being with a focus on equity, building upon our legacy of founding girls' education and leadership programs. In the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and aligned with our social impact commitments, we were pleased to announce a 3-year partnership with Amanda Gorman, activist, award-winning writer and the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history. The Estée Lauder Companies will contribute $3 million over 3 years to support WRITING CHANGE, a special initiative to advance literacy as a pathway to equality, access and social change. In addition, Mrs. Gorman will bring her Voice of Change to the Estee Lauder brand, debuting her first campaign in the second half of this fiscal year. 
In closing, we delivered outstanding performance to begin the new fiscal year amid the volatility and variability of the pandemic, while continuing to invest in sustainable long-term growth drivers. We are focusing on fundamental capabilities for product quality and the consumer-centric elements of acquisition, engagement and high-touch experiences and services. We are doing this while improving our cost structure, diversifying our portfolio and its distribution, investing behind the best growth opportunities and leading our values. Our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our company is reflected in the announcement today to raise the quarterly dividend. I'm forever grateful to the grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employees globally, who are making us a stronger company each and every day. 
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

We are off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically, driven by the nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the p",1590,"Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. We are off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically, driven by the nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the prior year. Global logistics constraints caused some retailers, primarily in North America, to order earlier to ensure popular sets and products would be on counter for holiday. We estimate that this contributed approximately 1.5 points to our first quarter sales growth that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 3 points to reported net sales growth, and currency added just over 2 points.  
From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas climbed 27% as COVID restrictions eased throughout the region. Brick-and-mortar retail grew sharply across all formats compared to the prior year period when many stores were temporarily shut down. Distribution in Kohl's with Sephora and in Target with Ulta Beauty began its phased rollout to initial stores and online in mid-August, with minimal impact on net sales growth for the quarter.  
With the strong resurgence of brick-and-mortar traffic, online organic sales growth in the Americas declined single digits against a sharp increase last year, while organic online penetration remained solid at 31% of sales. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 9 points to the overall reported growth in the region.  
In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 19% with virtually every market contributing to growth, led by the emerging markets in the Middle East, Turkey and Russia as well as the U.K. Most markets throughout the region saw COVID restrictions lifted, and some tourism resumed during the peak summer months. By channel, the region saw more balance between brick and mortar and online growth. All major categories grew this quarter, and the region saw the strongest growth in fragrance and makeup as social occasions increased.  
Our global Travel Retail business grew double-digit as China and Korea continue to be strong. Internal travel restrictions during the quarter in China slowed Hainan sales temporarily, but restrictions lifted in early September and traffic rebounded. Retailers also responded to the August dip by driving post-travel consumption online. Summer holiday travel in Europe and the Americas picked up, but international travel still reached only 40% of pre-COVID levels.  
In our Asia Pacific region, organic net sales rose 10%, driven by Greater China and Korea. The region overall experienced higher levels of COVID lockdowns this quarter compared to last year's quarter due to the rise of the Delta variant, although online remains strong. Sales growth in Mainland China was somewhat slower due to COVID restrictions during July and August. And the pace of online sales growth slowed following the successful 6-18 programs last quarter and in anticipation of the 11.11 shopping festival. As we've mentioned before, these key shopping moments have created some additional seasonality in our business in this region. More than half of our brands in virtually all channels rose double-digit in Mainland China.  
Hong Kong and Macau were bright spots this quarter. They benefited from strong new product launches from La Mer and Jo Malone and successful marketing campaigns from several other brands.  
From a category perspective, net sales growth in fragrance jumped nearly 50%. Virtually every brand that participates in the category contributed to growth, with exceptional double-digit increases from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Perfumes and colognes led the category growth; and bath, body and home fragrances continue to perform well.  
Net sales in makeup rose 18% as markets in the Americas and Europe began to recover from COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in makeup versus pre-COVID levels. However, makeup sales in the quarter were still 19% below 2 years ago. Nonetheless, Estee Lauder foundations continue to resonate strongly with consumers, and MAC leaned into the makeup recovery with a number of fun and compelling campaigns.  
Skin care sales remained strong during the quarter. Organic net sales grew 12%, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 6 percentage points to reported growth. Nearly all of our skin care brands contributed to growth, although Estee Lauder had a tough comparison with the prior year launch of its improved Advanced Night Repair Serum.  
Our hair care net sales rose 8% as traffic in salons and stores in the U.S. and Europe began to return. Both Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw growth in hero products as well as continued strength from innovation.  
Our gross margin declined 100 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing and currency were more than offset by higher obsolescence costs for both basic and holiday product sets and the inclusion of DECIEM.  
Operating expenses decreased 240 basis points as a percent of sales. Our strong sales growth was partly due to earlier orders from some North America retailers concerned about logistics constraints, and costs related to these sales are expected to be incurred in our second quarter. We do continue to manage costs with agility, realizing savings from our cost initiatives, while also investing to support a continued brick-and-mortar recovery as well as our strategic initiatives. Our operating income rose 32% to $941 million, and our operating margin rose 140 basis points to 21.4% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.89 increased 31% compared to the prior year.  
During the quarter, we used $81 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year. This reflects a more normalized first quarter where we typically have seasonally higher working capital needs. We invested $205 million in capital expenditures as we ramped up our investment to build a new manufacturing facility in Japan. And we returned $749 million in cash to stockholders through both share repurchases and dividends. We also announced this morning an increase in our quarterly dividend. 
So now let's turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing around the world, even in the context of an environment of increased volatility. Our strong performance reflects our ability to navigate through the volatility while leveraging our multiple engines of growth. At the same time, we are mindful that recovery is tenuous and likely to be uneven. Nevertheless, we are cautiously optimistic, and our assumptions for fiscal 2022 remain consistent.  
We continue to expect an emerging renaissance in the makeup category as restrictions are safely lifted and social occasions increase. We welcome the resumption of some travel in the Americas and EMEA in the first quarter. And as intercontinental restrictions are lifted, we expect international passenger traffic to build toward the end of the fiscal year.  
We began taking strategic pricing actions in July, and overall, pricing is expected to add at least 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary pressures. 
On the costs side, we plan to continue to increase advertising to support our brands and drive traffic in all channels. Selling costs are expected to rise to support the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail. We also continue to invest behind key strategic capabilities like data analytics, innovation, technology and sustainability initiatives.  
As you are all aware, global supply chains are being strained by COVID and its related effects in some markets, resulting in port congestion, higher fuel costs and labor shortages at a time when demand for goods is rising. This is causing us to experience inflation in freight and procurement, which we expect to impact our cost of goods and operating expenses beginning next quarter.  
Based on what we see through October, the expected benefit of pricing, combined with good cost discipline elsewhere, are enabling us to maintain our expectations for the year.  
For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on rates of 1.163 for the euro, 1.351 for the pound and 6.471 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full fiscal year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM.  
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.04 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise 11% to 14%.  
At this time, we expect organic sales for our second quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be neutral.  
Operating expenses are expected to rise in the second quarter as we support holiday activations and the continued recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world. Additionally, the prior year quarter included some benefit of government subsidies, which are not anticipated in the current year quarter.  
We expect second quarter EPS of $2.51 to $2.61. Both currency and the inclusion of DECIEM are expected to be immaterial to EPS. Notably, our EPS forecast also reflects a 23% tax rate compared to 15.9% in the prior year when we benefited from certain onetime items. 
In closing, we are pleased with the terrific start to the year and are proud of the continued efforts of our global team. We remain confident in our corporate strategy with its multiple growth engines to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Our holiday sets, we had anticipated some of the supply chain challenges earlier in the year when clearly our supply chain, and more publicly there were discussions about supply chain challenges. And so we did order some products early. We produced some products early, and we landed many of our gift sets early. And that set us up pretty well for Q2. 
So we are experiencing some inflation in transport. We're managing it as best we can. One of the things that certainly we have the benefit of is we are a luxury company, so we do have pricing power. And we have pricing power not only in our in-line products but also in our innovation as well. So we do have the opportunity and have taken the opportunity to offset some of the cost inflation with some of the pricing that we've taken this year."

We were encouraged at the end of last year and encouraged through the first quarter with MAC performance in both the Americas, so both North America as well as Latin America and also EMEA. So we really, with a return to brick-and-mortar as we had indicated before, we saw higher productivity of the remaining brick-and-mortar doors that we had opened. And we saw a bit of softness more in North America than in EMEA, but a bit of softness in online as traffic returned to brick-and-mortar. We think that will normalize out a bit in Q2, and we'll see a bit more balance. But as I think all of us can imagine, I think consumers are very excited about going back to brick-and-mortar stores in markets where restrictions were lifted and people felt more comfortable going out and socializing."

And then also, Fabrizio, if you think about what happened during the pandemic as consumers were migrating to well-known brands, exploration kind of came down a bit. But I suspect that that's starting to happen now as consumers are getting back out and exploring different brands. 
I just wanted to get your perspective on that dynamic, if that's what you're seeing? And how does Estée better prepare in the future to deal with all of these upstart brands that are starting up on social media?"

On a 2-year stack, we doubled it. And so is a very strong acceleration versus 2 years. And we see the progress to continue and the growth to continue. Obviously, in the moment where there was the opening of brick-and-mortar, the amount of growth online has slowed down, but the continuous growth is what is really encouraging. 
So the most important part of your question is what happened to the consumers' behavior. So what we saw during COVID that the consumers that were already online before, like younger consumer, continue to be online even more intensively. But there were many new consumers that just appeared online during the COVID period. There were more the ageless consumer, the more adult consumers. Now this consumer really enjoyed it, so they are staying online. And so that's what showed that the online continues to grow even when brick-and-mortar opens up. But obviously, the 2 channels' growth get rebalanced in this situation. So very optimistic for online.
The other thing that online continues to grow is that there are very different channels with level -- different level of growth. And we are growing in every single channel. And we are growing in TPP. We are growing in brand.com. We are growing in retail.com. We are growing in the pure plays. And this is very different by region because in every region, one of this channel is stronger than the others. 
So the combination of the global online growth is continued to be pretty exciting. And we count on this to continue even when brick-and-mortar will be fully recovered. And as a result, we have reached already 28% of our business in online, and this will gradually continue to grow over time. So very, very strong.
In terms of -- sorry, your second question, because it was a separate question, on consumer behaviors in Asia?"

You mentioned some green shoots. Obviously, a makeup recovery, Americas recovery. Asia, some softness with some of the government lockdowns in third quarter, but it sounded like that's getting better. 
And so I'm just trying to understand unchanged local currency top line guidance for the year. Is there something specific that's giving you more caution as you look at the balance of the year? Is it more just some conservatism, given it's early in the year? How do you sort of think about that relative to the Q1 top line delivery and some green shoots? And maybe specifically also, you can touch on the 11.11 shopping festival in China and what you're seeing there in terms of initial signs heading into that festival."

So in terms of -- we are encouraged obviously, as we should be, by our Q1 performance. We're still only a quarter in, as you mentioned it. We did have some early shipments in the quarter that obviously came out of the second quarter. So some of the growth as we mentioned, about 1.5 points was related to that. 
But as we look at the balance of the year, we are also while we are seeing encouragement, there's still a lot of volatility in the market. We did have some markets unexpectedly that were shut down in the first quarter. We are still managing through this pandemic. 
And so we are -- we believe that certainly as you look at Q2 on a 2-year stack basis, it is -- and really versus pre-pandemic, it's really quite strong. And again, you're seeing some of the seasonality related to 11.11 continue to impact Q1. And that's reflected in the Q2 and that's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. 
But we feel that the guidance that we've given for the year is incredibly strong. The only difference between the guidance that we gave last time and this time is currency. Our outlook on currency is a bit less. So that's the 1 point change in the guidance that you see. And then from a reported EPS standpoint, our guidance actually on a constant currency basis has improved quite a bit. 
So we I would say we are seeing green shoots. We are expressing confidence in the guidance that we are providing, quite a bit when you actually look at it from a EPS standpoint, even with all of the things that we're navigating through as it relates to transport, et cetera. And that goes to the choices that we're making as an organization in terms of where to invest and where not to invest, along with the pricing actions that we're taking as well."

So we feel very good about that.
In terms of Asia Pacific, inclusive of China but other markets as well, we did see some intermittent shutdowns in Asia. And that did include some traffic to Hainan being a bit curtailed in the July and August time frame and a bit into the early part of September. We saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Hainan pick up quite a bit when those travel restrictions were lifted almost immediately. So that is a positive sign.

So we manage this with agility, depending what is the commercial model that is emerging in China. We focus more on one China [ on another ], also depending by the season and by the moment. 
Also skin care, which I think is a great sign of strength. Skin care grew strong double-digit despite the very tough comparison with previous year, where in our case we launched the Advanced Night Repair relaunch. So it was a very big innovation in the base period. So brick-and-mortar in China also saw very strong growth. 
And our business online grew double digit, despite the fact that in quarter 1, online is a bit normally sandwiched between the 6.18 big event and the 11.11 big event. But despite that, we grew double digit. 
And the long-term fundamentals of the market in closing, namely the large and growing middle class with increasing spending per person, the remaining -- all these remain intact. And so the key idea is to be able to focus on the Chinese consumer in whatever channel they choose to shop at depending on the moment of the year.

First of all, DECIEM is an extraordinary company, and The Ordinary is a brand with enormous success and traction. And so first of all, we are collaborating with the management team of DECIEM to continue building both The Ordinary and to continue building the overall DECIEM company with their extraordinary incubation capability they have and new brands that they are creating for the future. So both of these activities. 
So the big learning is obviously the ability to create buzz and interest and the relationship between The Ordinary brand and the consumer is [ really restored ]. Obviously, we can learn a lot from this. But apart from learning, we can support them in the implementation of the global commercial strategies in increasing the reach of the brand, and obviously in leveraging the powerful connection with the consumer in the best possible way in supply chain, in R&D in many, many areas. So we can learn and we can support, and this exchange is proving to be very successful. 
Then on top of The Ordinary, there are other brands. They are building other ideas and creating for the future. So what we are learning is also the power of creative incubation and the creation of new brands. And this will have an influence on our future ability to continue developing brands. And definitely, we will leverage the strength of DECIEM also in this area."

And I think you had mentioned this on some previous calls in terms of where the growth is coming from, meaning that you weren't necessarily sourcing it from sales in the mainland. I guess I'm curious if that's still the case and kind of how you think about what has driven the growth? Especially as it seems like some of the duty-free operators are paying the duties to deliver product to mainland customers. So if that's true, kind of how do you think this all plays out in time in terms of having mainland and Hainan or kind of local duty-free work together?"
207221,685664866,2421396,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.","Executives","Yes. I mean keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estée Lauder, is on 140 cities. Where today with a strong social media and with a strong aspiration of values of our brand, as we speak, we can -- we have demand in more than 70",444,"Yes. I mean keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estée Lauder, is on 140 cities. Where today with a strong social media and with a strong aspiration of values of our brand, as we speak, we can -- we have demand in more than 700 cities. 
So there are many, many consumers in China that can only buy either online or traveling, and traveling domestically today and historically also traveling internationally. And so it's just the market, the -- commercially, the market is designed to have a very limited overlap between the Mainland China and the Hainan. 
Hainan serves an enormous amount of consumer that comes also from tier 3, tier 4 cities, areas where there is not a lot of brick-and-mortar distribution. And so Hainan can attract this consumer in this moment. Also is a place where people go for holidays. As part of these holidays, there is a lot of the pleasure of shopping, the pleasure of discovery. 
So the business in Hainan is proving to be a great trial builder more than in a cannibalizing business. And it's building trial of people that otherwise will not be able to trial our product, then will repurchase them. Will repurchase them maybe again in the future travel, but most of the times in their everyday life in Mainland China. 
So obviously, there is commercial competition. The market is becoming very competitive. There is a lot of players. Commercially, the region will continue to be intense competition. But there is every channel that serves frankly, a very different role. And so our strategy is to be able to leverage each one of this channel in the best possible way, with the idea of maximizing the coverage and the service to the total consumers in China that are interested in beauty, and over time to be able to better differentiate the scope of the channels and how the consumer will be served by the different channels. 
Last thing I want to say, Hainan had, at least the last number I've seen, over the 80 million visitors in the last year. So if you think that Hainan serves the entire middle class. Because it's domestic travel, you don't need to have a passport. So today in our knowledge about 12% to Chinese consumer had a passport. Even when international travel will restart, there will be even limited cannibalization versus international travel, because Hainan will serve many consumers that do not plan to travel internationally. So we are very positive on the long term and very positive on the ability to serve the consumers using different channels, which is our strategy."

As it relates to Kohl's and Target and also within Target and Sephora within Kohl's, we have seeded the initial doors. We certainly expect during the upcoming holiday season that we will see increased growth, obviously, in contribution from the distribution that we have. And we're pleased thus far with the partnership.

Also, we've been gaining shares in all categories during the quarter in Clinique, in MAC, La Mer, in Bobbi, in Tom Ford, in Jo Malone. So it's a very broad growth across. We are really ready with our innovation with the strong marketing programs. We had anticipated the comeback on makeup. We have strengthened our program in what we call the makeup renaissance in anticipation on the return to back to school or back to work. We had amazing programs so that -- we have added obviously The Ordinary, which is the #4 brand in skin care in prestige U.S. to our portfolio. 
So it's a combination of factors of improvement of the strategy and improvement of the execution in our North American organization, so a terrific quarter.

I hope you and your families are in good health, and our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19.
We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter and powered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees cared for each other, their families and our company with compassion, creativity and [ resolve ]. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin fiscal year 2022 as a stronger company, full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow.
For fiscal year 2021, sales rose 11% as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail in Asia/Pacific and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double digits, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variants of COVID-19 to the extent the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year.
We saw reopenings revert to closing, and reopenings in one market meant with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter.
Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skin care and fragrance. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 basis points above fiscal year 2019 as we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment.
First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work toward our racial equity commitments.
Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net 0 carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reduction target, addressing Scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of Scope 3 for our value chain, signaling our new level of ambition for climate actions.
We launched ingredient glossaries for 7 additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer this insightful content. We transformed our traditional inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience, with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including 4 antiracism and inclusive leadership. We expanded our [ growth road-led ] employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the tumult of last year.
The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global, with its expansion into Latin America and Asia/Pacific. We created 2 new leadership programs for women and black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique intensive course to develop our next generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the Opening Doors collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world.
[ The form ] every chair leadership and development program is successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership trainings, mentorships, career development and advancement opportunity as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants.
Our new partnership with Howard University focused on its alumina-hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training and self-empowering networking.
Let me now turn to product innovation, which serve as an impactful catalyst for growth in fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combine data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends across categories. The Estée Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products, along with innovation, were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris and now Sao Paulo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil.
Advanced Night Repair newly reformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supreme's new Supreme+ Bright Moisturizer, further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while Re-Nutriv new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand.
In makeup, the brand's double wear Futurist and pure Pure Color franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter and exciting early signs of makeup renaissance. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth in the fiscal year as innovation soared and engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient-based narratives drove demand for its hero products.
The new Genaissance de la Mer Concentrated Night Balm proved highly sought-after and expanded the brand's ultra-luxury franchise as it both welcomed new consumers and captivated loyal consumers globally.
Clinique skin care excelled in fiscal year 2021. Sales rose double digits and powered the brands to high single-digit sales growth. The brand successfully met consumer needs through the launch of Moisture Surge 100 Hour with its unique hydration benefits and target solution for hard-to-solve skin care problem like Even Better Clinical Interrupter. Clinique showcased its promise for makeup renaissance with stellar double-digit category growth in the fourth quarter with the new Even Better Clinical serum foundation and Even Better concealer capitalizing on its skin care authority.
All told, our robust skin care portfolio from entry prestige to luxury and across subcategories is fulfilling the [indiscernible] needs around the world. Dr. Jart+ with its [indiscernible] derma brand positioning and hero products delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth in the second half of fiscal year 2021. In May, we amplified the strength of our skin care portfolio as we became a majority owner of DECIEM with its coveted ingredient-based brand, The Ordinary, and emerging science-driven NIOD brand as part of its portfolio.
Complementing skin care strength, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frédéric Malle in both established fragrance markets of the West and emerging fragrance market of the East. Tom Ford Beauty's private blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving strong repeat in markets newly embracing the category, with the brand's [ drag ] and sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year.
The Asia/Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in fiscal year 2021 as annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22% led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia/Pacific's strengths. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolves with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia, particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered as we invested in its vibrancy of today, an opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence in specialty-multi, opened the freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending.
Skin care and fragrance sales grew strong double digit for the fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half.
Our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of Tmall's 11.11 Global Shopping Festival and 6.18 Mid-year Shopping Festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 6.18 among Tmall beauty flagship stores, the Estée Lauder brand ranked #1 in total beauty, while La Mer ranked first in luxury beauty and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market [indiscernible] online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographic by launching on JD in July.
With international travel largely curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic travel retail development of Hainan [ island ] to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way given the island tremendous traffic growth and higher duty free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the in-store and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth.
Looking at channels. Online strive globally in fiscal year 2021, characterized by strong double-digit sales gain and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was 2 years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com third-party platforms, retail.com and pure-play retailers delivered outstanding performance.
During the year, brand.com came to epitomize the allure of a luxury flagship store for each brands, localized by market and reimagined with our classic high-touch services. We expanded virtual trainer, live streaming, omnichannel capabilities and consultations with our expert beauty advisers. Consumers at all ages explored, replenished and engaged in an immersive environment of entertainment and community. Our brands increasingly leveraged the exciting trends in social commerce by integrating with Instagram, WeChat, Snapchat and others. Estée Lauder launched on TikTok with the Night Done Right hashtag, driving nearly 12 billion views and the creation of almost 2 million videos. It challenge [indiscernible] diverse creators to educate a younger audience on how important is to take care of your skin at night, showcasing Advanced Night Repair.
Clinique zit happens campaigns on TikTok became a viral sensation, highlighting the brand acne solution, [ exposing ] the creation of nearly 700,000 videos on the app. Together, these and other strategic actions delivered exceptional results for brand.com as new consumers, conversion, basket size, repeat and loyalty members grew considerably. Beyond the favorable growth rates, the direct relationship we fostered with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities.
We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize prestige beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about having expanded our presence with pure-play retailers, which continued into the fourth quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China.
For fiscal year 2022, we expect these growth engines of skin care, fragrance, Asia/Pacific, travel retail Asia/Pacific and global online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics, drive consumer acquisitions and retention, high-touch online services and robust innovation pipeline.
Three compelling skin care innovation recently launched: Estée Lauder new Advanced Night Repair Eye Matrix is focused on lines in every eye zone, while La Mer The Hydrating Infused Emulsion is designed to replenish, strengthen and stabilize skin with healing moisture and has already proven to attract new consumers. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is designed to visibly reduce stubborn lines.
Our Shanghai innovation center is expected to open in the second half of this fiscal year, enriching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estée Lauder Futurist Hydra or Supreme+ Bright and La Mer, The Treatment Lotion.
As the world emerge from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure-play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies and channels.
Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines as our developed markets in the West and brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening and increase in socially professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeup started to improve to the end of fiscal year 2021 driven by our hero subcategories of foundation and mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of MAC Magic Extension mascara, Too Faced lip plumper, Smashbox Halo tinted moisturizer and Bobbi Brown Sheer pressed powder. Contributing to makeup emerging renaissance, MAC launched MAC The Moment, a campaign linking its makeup products and artists inspire trends to key experiences such as dead night parties, weddings and back-to-school shopping.
Too Faced expanded into browse in July with a collection that includes an innovative brow gel that add color and texture. Similar to makeup, hair care is set to benefit from the rise of socially professional user education as well as salon reopenings. Aveda, which is now 100% vegan, and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum, owing to desirable innovation and rich consumer engagement from strong online performance globally over the past year.
As makeup and hair care reunite, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the West and, over time, by emerging markets.
In the United States, the fourth quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and in-store activations as consumers returned to stores eager to explore beauty and experience high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty-multi and freestanding stores, our business in the United States prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations.
As we start our new fiscal year, Bobbi Brown recently debuted in Ulta Beauty. Several of our brands launched online and in-store with Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta Beauty at Target.
In closing, we leveraged the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy to elevate the company to new heights in fiscal year 2021. We did this while living our values with the health and well-being of our employees as primary focused and making important progress on our social impact commitment and sustainability goals.
Our success and agility in operating amid the challenges of the past year give us confidence for fiscal year 2022 as we expect volatility and variability from the pandemic to persist for some time to come.
This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a company and beginning our next 75 years incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude.
I will now turn the call over to Tracey."

I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility, and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the fiscal year while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability.
We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year period. The inclusion of 6 weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the prepandemic levels of the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skin care and fragrance categories, global online and travel retail in Asia. All 3 regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the quarter.
Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong programs supporting recovery, new product launches and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remain below fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly $170 million in annual sales.
Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recoup sales lost during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected.
Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 65%, with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the quarter.
Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international passenger traffic but grew strong double digits in the quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan, remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up, and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the quarter driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above fiscal '19 levels for the quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail.
Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varies widely among the markets, and the resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double digits in the region driven by the successful 6.18 Shopping Festival Campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, grew exceptionally against prior year brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year.
Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales in fiscal 2019.
Fragrance led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence and among Chinese consumers increasingly attracted to the category. Home, Bath & Body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and help to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to prepandemic levels in brick-and-mortar. And the brand's blossom and brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of Tubéreuse Nue and the continued strength of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick.
Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estée Lauder saw strong growth of Futurist and double wear foundations in Asia, and MAC liquid lip color and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed.
Hair care net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of the Aveda's blonde revival shampoo and conditioner also contributed to category growth, adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda.
Net sales in skin care continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer, Estée Lauder, Clinique and Dr. Jart+ brands, particularly in Asia. Skin care sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4 percentage points.
Our gross margin improved 650 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations.
Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic, and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation.
We delivered operating income of $385 million for the quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth while effectively managing both costs and cash.
The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skin care and fragrance categories and the momentum we drove in our online channels all supported our growth.
Our distribution mix continued to evolve even as brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continue to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the travel retail channel grew, ending fiscal 2021 at 29% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, specialty-multi and perfumeries grew, while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year.
Our gross margin rose 120 basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost for testers and stores, and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased, while advertising investments, primarily digital media, rose faster than sales to support our brands and the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the post-COVID business acceleration program, and this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorb some of the inflation in media and logistics costs as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic.
Our full year operating margin was 18.9%, representing a 420 basis point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable onetime adjustment for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI tax regulations. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ and DECIEM.
In fiscal 2021, we recorded $148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brand as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the post-COVID business acceleration program were $176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the onetime gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of $847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share.
The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly, with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We are also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and RODIN. These actions are expected to continue into fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested.
We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized $637 million for capital improvement, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid $750 million of debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued $600 million of new long-term debt and retired $450 million of debt. We used $1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM, and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via increased dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activity in the second half of the fiscal year.
So looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic in brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly, and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business.
Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic, and therefore, providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the fiscal year, caveated with the following underlying assumptions: progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mask-wearing abates in Western markets during the first half of the fiscal year; beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the fiscal year; the addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online; the inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions and in the skin care category; pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk in freight, media, labor and commodities; increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere.
We forecast increasing benefits from our post-COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately $200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence and compensation.
In addition to these assumptions, there are a few nonoperating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefit of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18, 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM, and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct the portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in fiscal 2022.
Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected sales as we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America, increase investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our CapEx plan for the year also includes some spending deferred from last year.
Also, beginning in fiscal 2022, we plan to introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations. Organic growth adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure such as acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business.
Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on August 13 spot rates of 1 17 for the euro, 1.381 for the pound, 11 64 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to add 1 point to reported sales growth for the full fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM.
Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM.
At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 3 points.
Operating expenses are expected to rise in the first quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05, and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact.
In closing, while we are cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estée Lauder Companies leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

But this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is -- continue to grow, and we expect this to continue to grow for many years to come, and the trend will not stop after COVID. Also our online mix, which is 3PP in China, for example, which, as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying our last 18.6 event, was really strong. And then retail.com for many retailers around the world is booming, pure-play, which is very much growing and then brand.com. And obviously, brand.com, in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment, there is the big reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease but then will start growing again. That's our expectation.
So overall, all in all, our online business will continue to progress as a percentage of total business over the next years."

As it relates to technology, we are investing quite a bit in our e-commerce platform to enable capabilities, many of which we have spoken about, whether it's virtual try-on, our data analytics that certainly support are being able to more personalize experiences for consumers and many other capabilities and beyond online where we continue to invest in the consumer experience in our stores and in other areas as well. So we do have a robust technology investment plan that I would expect to continue over the next couple of years.

So it will leverage quite a bit of technology also."

So a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But overall, Asia/Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China whose progress we will continue to develop in our opinion. And also, that's what's happening so far.
Now the -- what you call variability of sales, meaning up and downs of sales in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, frankly, it's more about seasonality. There is a clear seasonality like there is in the U.S., like there is in Europe. And there are holiday moments, Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which they are more home, moment where there are festivities and there are moments of the year where certain products, particularly in skin care, more used than others, obviously, there is important elements of seasonality. Now the good news, we are completely on top of those, and we manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter year programs are pretty well articulated and recognized consumer seasonality and trade promotionality period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue. That's why I will not call it variability but rather seasonality."

The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we are having on innovation and the kind of very attractiveness of our innovation, that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great grade quality that we are deploying to the consumers. And at the moment, you have between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our intent and the power of our innovation.

The proof that what [ will work happen ] in the U.S. in this last quarter is very encouraging. In this last quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong, for example, in countries where there was a recovery reopen like the U.S. And we saw great results on MAC, on Too Faced and many other brands. And we saw particularly the recovery start from foundation and lipsticks, which is a very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is, first of all, we are preparing programs -- marketing programs and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we tie those to the expected recovery trend.
They will be gradual, but we will be, as you know, will be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world, and we find our marketing action, our advertising relaunch actions, our innovation actions to the different expected recovery moments. So it's a pretty complex elaboration plan, but it's very effective, and so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on investment that we wanted when you time it correctly.
The second thing that we are doing, obviously, is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and as I said, by makeup subcategories that are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the user education gets restated. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas.
So all in all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China. And we are well organized to follow up on the recovery gradually in the course of 2022."

First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future, and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the come back to international travel. Let me explain that. If you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving toward the 15% from the information, which are available, and you assume that only a percentage of those consumers with the passport travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population. Hainan is domestic travel. So it's open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically goes well beyond international travel because it's domestic travel and appeals 100% to the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long term, that will continue to grow even when international travel will restart.
As far as the international travel question, we are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our fiscal year -- '22 fiscal year. And this is obviously -- this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions and how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic. So it's -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we are currently estimating. And we have seen already some -- for example, in summer in Europe, we are seeing some new travels and new movements and some increase, but obviously, relatively still very much below what was before COVID. And then in fiscal year 2023, we assume there will be a more robust international travel acceleration."

And the other thing I want to say on travel retail on the long term, as I said, is the travel retail as this addition of the domestic travel in China, which is a very important additions. And so the development of the business with the Chinese consumers is extraordinary. And then the Chinese consumer, depending on the period of the year, their choices, some of them would travel, travel to Hainan, [ buy there ], others would buy in their cities. And so you will see this spending growth of the Chinese consumers in the China region or in the travel retail Hainan depending on what the Chinese consumer decide to do.
Our strategy is very simple. We are going to serve the growing demand of Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop. And so we are online. We are in the outstanding quality department stores in China. We are in Hainan. And in all these areas where they shop, we tend to be present with outstanding execution, great luxury quality of services and to really give justice to our elevated luxury positioning in these positions. And that's the strategy to cover the Chinese consumer shopping.
And as far as the when the international traveling will restart will obviously also cover the international travels in the best possible way.
In terms of your second part of the question is -- I would like to clarify one thing. I think fiscal year 2021 was an extraordinary year to build our luxury position and to elevate our consumer expression in a very luxury way. If you think that the core investment that we have done has been in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online, and we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury experience services than in the past were only in the best department stores or in the best brick-and-mortar locations. So this now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business. Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in [ TR ]. It's been for since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now it's in Hainan where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world. And that's the key areas where we invest.
We have also taken the opportunity where there is the opportunity to source from [ us ] and to continue growing the prestige segment to bring some of our brands that have the power of sourcing from [ us ] closer to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop at once to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality. And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and the Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from us and further serve more consumers and consumers that we didn't access before with our best experience and best quality products."
