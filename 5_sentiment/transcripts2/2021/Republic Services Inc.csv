Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation",526,"Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation, and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication and commitment, we delivered record-setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high end of the original guidance we provided last February. 
During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year; generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes; expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%; improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%; increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%; and achieved record-setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our #1 strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. 
We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full, and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provide the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call. 
Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to again thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jon."

Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was",757,"Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years. 
Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yields to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021. 
During the fourth quarter, volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter, with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels. 
Fourth quarter small-container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large-container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. 
Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021. 
Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in implant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above-average growth rates. 
We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. 
Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased [ 67% ] to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to [ $66 ] per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume. 
Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience. 
I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021. 
Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long term. 
As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future. 
In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond. 
Our sustainability performance continues to be well-regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America Indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time. 
I will now turn the call over to Brian."

Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1. This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56.

This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was [ $0.16 ] above the high end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 of the beat resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working and utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile. 
We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased [ $62 ] million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital. 
Working capital included a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and a 2.5-day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes. 
Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid-40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI-based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison. 
During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately [ $60 ] million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. 
With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately [ 16% ] for the year. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021 made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of noncash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth. 
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

We continue to see more increases and decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. 
I mentioned the pipeline being strong. So we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked, as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in '20 we expect to hold on to. 
But look at pricing, pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market is coming back, and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it as we go through time. But that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as -- alongside of it. 
And then I think there's a little bit of talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business. A little inflation will help CPI tick up. So we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business. 
Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here in '21 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now, and it's the matter of the pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year. 
But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think."

One of the things, I think, you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple-digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers. And we're talking about further margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through '21. 
But if you take a look at the puts and takes, what's underlying that 29.5, we're looking at underlying expansion of, call it, somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together. To your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those 2 is about a 20 basis point headwind to margin. 
And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year 1. That's predominantly just from the integration, the transaction and the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So while it's dilutive in year 1, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year 2 and beyond."

One, it's truly the only zero-based emission technology out there. CNG is incrementally better than diesel, but only incrementally better than that. So it's the right technology long term. And our application tends to be a perfect one for electrification because range anxiety is a big issue in trucking for electrification, and we don't have that as our trucks come home to the same location every night, and you can get into overnight charging. So we're really excited about the technology. And we're going to get there. We've always said there's going to be multiple paths to get there, and there's going to be some uncertainty. The destination is clear. The path to get there has some uncertainty. So we've got a number of different relationships going on. Pilots with multiple manufacturers. We talked about the Romeo investment. And in terms of the specific partnership that we exited, right, disappointing for us, but that didn't cost us anything. That contract was very intentionally designed. It was performance-based. And the extent they couldn't execute against the performance, it costs us nothing on that front. So disappointing again because we're cheering for everybody to get there because we think it's good for the planet, but we are confident that we've got the right set of partners, and we're going to be excited to update you on our progress as we move forward."

What's your thought on how you weather this pandemic and what you can do to perhaps press the accelerate a little bit, especially with your pipeline that you just mentioned is full and balanced?

So as it relates to leverage, we've always stated what our optimal leverage is, and we've been, for the last couple of years now, kind of keeping right in that 3x. The good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow and even increase the overall debt level, but keep your leverage pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right? 
So we are -- we have in the past, for the right deal, increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 or 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to overlever the company by any means. But we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done. Getting deals through DOJ accordingly, getting assets sold if necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that improving capability within our team. 
So yes, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change the regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling, a lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time, and they start to think about selling their business as their retirement. So we are right there to pick them up. 
Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position but with the appetite to move into that #1 or #2 spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So the pipeline is strong. The ability to get deals done and integrate deals are strong, and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place."

As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we are no longer tolerating, right, we're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. 
And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned, that's good for us is because, again, we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, puts upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or CPI or water store trash-related indices. And I think even in the open market, just put upward pressure on pricing and what customers are willing to pay."

The waste service providers in America didn't get near enough respect or appreciation from people at large. They showed up every day with very little complaining and were true heroes. And to Jon's point, we're going to continue to reward that over time. And a fair rate works. And the underlying issue is really the market is rational, and it's allowing us to continue to move that needle little by little by little, and we've got a big portion of our book now corrected."

The RISE platform, while we've got it rolled out, it's only in sort of the early phases of that. That is going to be something that we'll build on. Once we get connected digitally to customers and all different parts of our business, we'll just continue to add enhancements that drive margin, that drive quality, customer experience, that drive customer loyalty, will drive price, right? The safety story is a good story. 
Fleet is a good story. And then M&A, right? As we build, we're going to do a nice balance of new platform acquisitions, new markets, but also our bread and butter is still tuck-ins in markets we're already in. It's come at a higher margin. They're quicker to integrate. So there's just a handful of things that are in our favor. And we'll continue to invest properly in the business. 
We told you we had 30% in our site as we're right there. And a 30% margin will be here before you know it. How's that?"

And then it gets a little bit tougher as you move into the second half, but our expectation is that it still remains positive. 
So again, we are projecting that the economy continues to gradually improve, and that is baked into our guide on the top line. But as you kind of said, meaningful type volume recovery to get there, I would say, no. Most of that has already occurred based on what we've seen in '20 with some modest improvement going forward in unit recovery."

One, it certainly even strengthens our result to go into city hall and get a pricing mechanism that we think works for both parties. Historically, the industry is price recycling on the back end, which has caused a lot of volatility in the business that is otherwise quite stable. And we think the fairest pricing model that we get paid a fair return to pick it up, a fair return to process it, and then we share in the commodity value on the back end. And as commodity prices get higher, it's easier to talk to customers, particularly in municipalities, about getting that model right. 
And then, listen, long term, we're bullish on recycling, right? We see a world that has population growth and material scarcity and a big desire from a lot of different aspects around reuse and recycle. And we think we're going to be a big part of that and a big player in that. We just have to make sure that to be environmentally sustainable, it's economically sustainable, and we get a fair return for the work that we do."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation, and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication and commitment, we delivered record-setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high end of the original guidance we provided last February. 
During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year; generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes; expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%; improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%; increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%; and achieved record-setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our #1 strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. 
We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full, and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provide the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call. 
Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to again thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jon."

Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years. 
Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yields to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021. 
During the fourth quarter, volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter, with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels. 
Fourth quarter small-container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large-container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. 
Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021. 
Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in implant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above-average growth rates. 
We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. 
Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased [ 67% ] to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to [ $66 ] per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume. 
Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience. 
I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021. 
Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long term. 
As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future. 
In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond. 
Our sustainability performance continues to be well-regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America Indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time. 
I will now turn the call over to Brian."

This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was [ $0.16 ] above the high end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 of the beat resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working and utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile. 
We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased [ $62 ] million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital. 
Working capital included a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and a 2.5-day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes. 
Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid-40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI-based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison. 
During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately [ $60 ] million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. 
With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately [ 16% ] for the year. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021 made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of noncash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth. 
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. 
I mentioned the pipeline being strong. So we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked, as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in '20 we expect to hold on to. 
But look at pricing, pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market is coming back, and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it as we go through time. But that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as -- alongside of it. 
And then I think there's a little bit of talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business. A little inflation will help CPI tick up. So we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business. 
Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here in '21 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now, and it's the matter of the pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year. 
But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think."

One of the things, I think, you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple-digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers. And we're talking about further margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through '21. 
But if you take a look at the puts and takes, what's underlying that 29.5, we're looking at underlying expansion of, call it, somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together. To your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those 2 is about a 20 basis point headwind to margin. 
And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year 1. That's predominantly just from the integration, the transaction and the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So while it's dilutive in year 1, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year 2 and beyond."

So as it relates to leverage, we've always stated what our optimal leverage is, and we've been, for the last couple of years now, kind of keeping right in that 3x. The good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow and even increase the overall debt level, but keep your leverage pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right? 
So we are -- we have in the past, for the right deal, increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 or 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to overlever the company by any means. But we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done. Getting deals through DOJ accordingly, getting assets sold if necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that improving capability within our team. 
So yes, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change the regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling, a lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time, and they start to think about selling their business as their retirement. So we are right there to pick them up. 
Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position but with the appetite to move into that #1 or #2 spot before too long, and that's still our approach.

And so -- from the operations side, and that's where -- that's the team that really builds routes and directs the trucks out every morning and adjust those trucks sometimes in the middle of the day so that we can service our customers. And we got them into a very visual-based mapping structure that allows us to build routes more efficiently and, frankly, more effectively for customers to improve our delivery time and speed. We're now in the process of rolling that technology into all of our vehicles. And so now we'll have 2-way communication between dispatch and the vehicle. And we think that has a number of benefits. One, it allows us to provide a better employee experience. It certainly allows us to take more costs out of the system because we're more efficient. And then it'll also allow us to connect to all of the customer-facing investments we've made over time that allow us to provide service notification, verification and reporting and a number of the benefits that customers want, which we think will help further differentiate our offering in the marketplace."

And even in a low inflationary environment, we have a strong belief that our people need to raise every year. Their expenses are going up. And so we want something that covers that cost increase and then hopefully increase a little more. That allows us to expand margins over time. 
Our broad view is that we don't want to get too concentrated on any single indice, whether that be fixed or water through trust or anything else. So we like a balanced approach. As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we are no longer tolerating, right, we're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. 
And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned, that's good for us is because, again, we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, puts upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or CPI or water store trash-related indices.

Outstanding. I guess I have a little bit of a long-term or even the medium-term growth strategy question here, which is I think we understand that there's always a component of churn that is structural and driven by bankruptcies. I think if you had tested back in April that you'd be exiting the year at a 93% retention rate, we would have been surprised. It's interesting to note, commercial bankruptcies are actually down year-over-year in the U.S. and still just listening to what you said about your own cost structure. I mean, if more companies act like Republic and continue to not spend on hospitality, travel and some of the other expense in the past, where business formation and where growth happens in the economy is still going to change from what we might have expected previously. So how do you calibrate for that? How do you position the business to capture where the growth is going to be?"

We have a good concentration in what I would call [ Sunbelt ] markets, but markets that people move to, whether it's the Northwest, down the West Coast, across the South and up into the Carolinas. We're well positioned in places like Texas and Florida, right? A lot of people move in there these days. So we've still got strong positions in metro markets, right? 
This thing is going to settle down. People are going to become more rational in their behavior again, and we are well positioned to pick up all the growth in the markets we're in. So the way that growth comes will change. Downturns and these kind of shocks to the economy that we've lived through for our entire lives here and there are different. This one is different than the last one. So there's still strong demand for housing, right? And we've always talked about how single-family home housing starts and household formation clearly tracks with our growth. So that paints a pretty strong picture. 
Household formation lends to business formation. There's a lot, I think, pent-up demand in the consumer. Consumer is in pretty good shape, right? When you think about wage growth, you think about what's happened in savings accounts across the nation, I think there's a lot of people just chomping at the bit to get out. And so while we may have pulled in a little bit on T&E, it doesn't mean the average consumer is going to -- I think they're going to get out there and rush to some new opportunity, right? And so we're not too concerned and -- about that. The free market always finds a way, and we're right smack to have in the middle of the free market, right?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation, and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication and commitment, we delivered record-setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high end of the original guidance we provided last February.
During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year; generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes; expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%; improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%; increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%; and achieved record-setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our #1 strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.
We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full, and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. 
As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provide the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call.
Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to again thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jon."

Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was",754,"Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years.
Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yields to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021.
During the fourth quarter, volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels.
Fourth quarter small-container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large-container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business.  
Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021.
 
Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in in-plant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above-average growth rates. We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform.  
Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 67% to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to $66 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume.
Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience.
I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021.
Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long term.
As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future.
In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond.
Our sustainability performance continues to be well regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America Indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time.  
I will now turn the call over to Brian."
386225,700849981,2218967,"Republic Services, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2021",2021-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1. This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56.

This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was $0.16 above the high end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 of the beat resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working and utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile.
We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased $62 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital.
Working capital included a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and a 2.5-day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes.
Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid-40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI-based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison.
During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately $60 million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range.
With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately 16% for the year. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021 made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of noncash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth.
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

We continue to see more increases than decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing.  
I mentioned the pipeline being strong, so we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked, as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in '20 we expect to hold on to.  
But look at pricing. Pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market's coming back, and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it as we go through time. But that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as -- alongside of it.
And then I think there's a little bit talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business. A little inflation will help CPI tick up. So we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business.
Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here in '21 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now, and it's the matter of the pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year.
But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think."

Look, I'll give you the puts and takes here in a second, but just kind of to further Don's comment, one of the things, I think, you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple-digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers. And we're talking about further margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through '21.
But if you take a look at the puts and takes, what's underlying that 29.5%, we're looking at underlying expansion of, call it, somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together. To your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those 2 is about a 20 basis point headwind to margin.
And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year 1. That's predominantly just from the integration, the transaction and the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So while it's dilutive in year 1, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year 2 and beyond."

So again, we're guiding on the top line to organic growth, which is that combination of yield and volume. How much revenue we get in '21 again on the $600 million will be more timing-based than anything else."

We're also looking at new geographies and have gotten into different extended geographies in the last 2 to 3 years, which, again, provides new growth opportunities and then also into new parts of the business.
So we mentioned environmental solutions, and those are actually core customers of ours. We've done work for them for a long period of time. It's really expanding our product line into those customers because they've asked us to do it. They want a provider who can provide digital solutions, who's got a great track record on safety and sustainability, and we're finding it attractive to expand our product set through acquisitions there as well."

What's your thought on how you weather this pandemic and what you can do to perhaps press the accelerate a little bit, especially with your pipeline that you just mentioned is full and balanced? Could we see a little bit of higher leverage now that it seems that you can tolerate a little bit higher leverage to take advantage of that M&A opportunity?"

So as it relates to leverage, we've always stated the way that our optimal leverage is, and we've been, for the last couple of years now, kind of keeping right in that 3x. The good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow and even increase the overall debt level but keep your leverage pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right?
So we are -- we have, in the past, for the right deal, increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 or 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to over lever the company by any means. But we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done, getting deals through DOJ accordingly, getting assets sold if necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that improving capability within our team.
So yes, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change the regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling, a lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time, and they start to think about selling their business as their retirement. So we are right there to pick them up.
Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position but with the appetite to move into that #1 or #2 spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So the pipeline is strong. The ability to get deals done and integrate deals is strong, and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place."

And look, we remain open minded, right, as the technologies emerge and evolve, but I think it's -- we're pretty confident electrification is going to be the right technology for our application. And then we're working through the alliance with Romeo. They're not going to become an exclusive supplier to us by any means. That wasn't the nature of the relationship and deal. However, we are working on proprietary things together, including a pilot where we retrofit one of our vehicles because that's what's electrification.

I think if you had tested back in April that you'd be exiting the year at a 93% retention rate, we would have been surprised. It's interesting to note, commercial bankruptcies are actually down year-over-year in the U.S.
And still just listening to what you said about your own cost structure.

We're well positioned in places like Texas and Florida, right? A lot of people move in there these days. So we've still got strong positions in metro markets, right?
This thing is going to settle down. People are going to become more rational in their behavior again, and we are well positioned to pick up all the growth in the markets we're in. So the way that growth comes will change. Downturns and these kind of shocks to the economy that we've lived through for our entire lives here and there are different. This one's different than the last one. So there's still strong demand for housing, right? And we've always talked about how single-family home housing starts and household formation clearly tracks with our growth. So that paints a pretty strong picture.
Household formation lends to business formation. There's a lot, I think, pent-up demand in the consumer. The consumer's in pretty good shape, right? When you think about wage growth, you think about what's happened in savings accounts across the nation, I think there's a lot of people just chomping at the bit to get out. And so while we may have pulled in a little bit on T&E, it doesn't mean the average consumer is going to -- I think they're going to get out there and rush to some new opportunity, right?

One, it certainly even strengthens our resolve to go into city hall and get a pricing mechanism that we think works for both parties. Historically, the industry is price recycling on the back end, which has caused a lot of volatility in a business that is otherwise quite stable and we think the fairest pricing model that we get paid a fair return to pick it up, a fair return to process it, and then we share in the commodity value on the back end. And as commodity prices get higher, it's easier to talk to customers, particularly in municipalities, about getting that model right.
And then, listen, long term, we're bullish on recycling, right? We see a world that has population growth and material scarcity and a big desire from a lot of different aspects around reuse and recycle.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation, and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication and commitment, we delivered record-setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high end of the original guidance we provided last February.
During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year; generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes; expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%; improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%; increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%; and achieved record-setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our #1 strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.
We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full, and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. 
As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provide the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call.
Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to again thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jon."

Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was",754,"Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years.
Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yields to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021.
During the fourth quarter, volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels.
Fourth quarter small-container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130 basis point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large-container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. 
Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021.
 
Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in in-plant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above-average growth rates. We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. 
Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 67% to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to $66 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume.
Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience.
I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021.
Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long term.
As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future.
In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond.
Our sustainability performance continues to be well regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America Indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time. 
I will now turn the call over to Brian."

This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was $0.16 above the high end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 of the beat resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working and utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile.
We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased $62 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital.
Working capital included a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and a 2.5-day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes.
Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid-40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI-based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison.
During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately $60 million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range.
With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately 16% for the year. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021 made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of noncash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth.
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

We continue to see more increases than decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. 
I mentioned the pipeline being strong, so we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked, as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in '20 we expect to hold on to. 
But look at pricing. Pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market's coming back, and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it as we go through time. But that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as -- alongside of it.
And then I think there's a little bit talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business. A little inflation will help CPI tick up. So we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business.
Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here in '21 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now, and it's the matter of the pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year.
But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think."

But if you take a look at the puts and takes, what's underlying that 29.5%, we're looking at underlying expansion of, call it, somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together. To your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those 2 is about a 20 basis point headwind to margin.
And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year 1. That's predominantly just from the integration, the transaction and the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So while it's dilutive in year 1, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year 2 and beyond."

One, it's truly the only 0-based emission technology out there. CNG is incrementally better than diesel but only incrementally better than that, so it's the right technology long term.

So we're really excited about the technology.
And we're going to get there. We've always said there's going to be multiple paths to get there, and there's going to be some uncertainty. The destination is clear. The path to get there has some uncertainty.
So we've got a number of different relationships going on, pilots with multiple manufacturers. We talked about the Romeo investment. And in terms of the specific partnership that we exited, right, disappointing for us, but that didn't cost us anything. That contract was very intentionally designed. It was performance-based.

So as it relates to leverage, we've always stated the way that our optimal leverage is, and we've been, for the last couple of years now, kind of keeping right in that 3x. The good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow and even increase the overall debt level but keep your leverage pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right?
So we are -- we have, in the past, for the right deal, increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 or 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to over lever the company by any means. But we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done, getting deals through DOJ accordingly, getting assets sold if necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that improving capability within our team.
So yes, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change the regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling, a lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time, and they start to think about selling their business as their retirement. So we are right there to pick them up.
Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position but with the appetite to move into that #1 or #2 spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So the pipeline is strong. The ability to get deals done and integrate deals is strong, and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place."

We've always talked about in election year, some of those jobs tend to stall out just given the uncertainty, and our pipeline remains strong through 2020. But we did see some of those jobs push out, and those jobs are now hitting. So as special waste gets more busy, that should put some upward pressure on pricing on the landfill side."

But also keep in mind, we're always looking at the income statement and the balance sheet. We're going to make the optimal trade-off on the asset. And so you could have 0 time -- or 0 overtime by running a truck 40 hours a week, but that wouldn't be a very good capital trade-off, right?
So we think in the low 50s is really the optimal spot from hours per week where that truck should be running, and that balances out customer service and safety and employee experience and all those things.

And so we want something that covers that cost increase and then hopefully increase a little more that allows us to expand margins over time.
Our broad view is that we don't want to get too concentrated on any single indice, whether that be fixed or water, sewer, trash or anything else. So we like a balanced approach. As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we are no longer tolerating, right, we're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. 
And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned that's good for us is because, again, we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, puts upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or CPI or water, sewer, trash-related indices.

There's probably some people that have some of that feeling about COVID, but we went from, hey, surprise, COVID here to the bottom falling out across the market, defining that bottom in a pretty short order and then battling back. It wasn't this ongoing 3-, 4-year slump of this abyss. We're coming out of it, right?
And there are still people who are dealing with tragedy. There are people dealing with hardship, and we're not minimizing any of that. But all in all, over the top of it, the economy is coming out of it, and we're coming out of it with it. And we're seeing those things reflect in our business.

I appreciate the kind words, and I'm honored to have this opportunity to be Republic's next CEO. Now turning to the first quarter results. We continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive revenue growth for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. The pricing environment remains strong, which allowed us to deliver double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion. Total core price was 4.3% and average yield was 2.3%. The core price included open market pricing of 5.2% and restricted pricing of 2.8%. As discussed in our last earnings call, average yield was expected to be relatively lower in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to achieve average yield of at least 2.5% for the full year. 
During the first quarter, volume decreased 80 basis points versus the prior year. This is a 100 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter with nearly all lines of business showing improvement. We expect volume to turn positive in the second quarter and remain positive for the remainder of the year. We continue to drive profitable growth and believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. Earlier today, we closed the acquisition of Santek. We welcome these new employees to the Republic team, and we look forward to integrating these high-quality assets into our business. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is strong, and we remain on track to invest at least $600 million in acquisitions for the full year. 
Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue decreased $17 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 70 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. We continue to focus on the downstream portion of this business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. Moving on to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 75% to $133 per ton in the first quarter. This compared to $76 per ton in the prior year. Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 30.7% and increased 270 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to successfully manage our costs for changes in underlying demand and leverage our new, more efficient ways of working. This includes utilizing our RISE platform and accelerating the use of technology to drive efficiencies and improve the customer and employee experience. In the first quarter, we continued our high-performing safety record reducing safety incidents 18% versus the prior year. We continue to see the positive contribution from our maniacal focus on the customer experience. In the first quarter, our NPS increased 4 points over the prior year, and we achieved a record set in customer retention at 94%. During the first quarter, we made further progress towards our long-term sustainability goals. As part of our sustainability platform, we recognize the importance of identifying and managing opportunities and risks related to climate change. We remain committed to transparency on metrics that are important to all our stakeholders. We are proud to be the first in the industry to disclose our climate-related opportunities and risks through a comprehensive TCFD report. We were also recently named to Fortune's 2021 most Admired companies list. This is an award recognizing our team focused management, innovation and socially responsible business practices. Looking ahead, we expect to outperform our original guidance due to our strong start and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year financial guidance as follows: adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.74 to $3.79, and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.4 billion.

Additionally, there was 1 less workday, which reduced revenue by 50 basis points compared to the prior year. The components of volume included a decrease in small container volume of 2.8%. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. A decrease in large container volume of 2.1%. This represents a 130 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter and an increase in landfill volume of 2.5%. And the increase in landfill volume includes a 3.5% increase in MSW volume and a 1.9% increase in special waste. Within the quarter, volume performance was negative in January and February and turned positive in March. We expect volume will remain positive for the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 30.7% and increased 270 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 210 basis points, a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices and a 40 basis point benefit from 1 less workday. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and effective cost management. SG&A expense for the first quarter was 10.2% of revenue, an improvement of 70 basis points over the prior year. While SG&A costs have decreased, expressed in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue, we continue to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million and increased $178 million compared to the prior year. This increase is the result of EBITDA growth, positive contribution from working capital and the timing of capital expenditures. Working capital included a 1-day improvement in DSO and a 2-day improvement in DPO. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million during the first quarter, represents 17% of our projected full year spend. The timing benefit of capital expenditures will flip over the remainder of the year. During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion and total liquidity was $3 billion. Interest expense decreased $18 million as a result of our refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio decreased to 2.9x. With respect to taxes, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 26%. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 28.4%.

Don will always be known as a visionary who successfully integrated the several hundred acquisitions and have formed the current Day Republic. He strengthened Republic foundation while investing in the capabilities that allow us to drive profitable growth and shareholder value. During the last 10 years, Don has led the company to more than triple our stock price and market capitalization, which now approaches $35 billion. Among everything that has accomplished, as big as achievement is the culture he created. He made Republic Service as a place where the best people come to work. He professionalized our company and motivated our talent along the way by modeling a purpose-driven approach to the business. He took care of the team, and in turn, they are taking care of one another. We should all be so lucky to have a career like this, 35 years of service to a company that has created tremendous value for all. No one has driven value creation for their employees, customers, communities and shareholders like Don. So on behalf of our 35,000 team members across the country as well as our industry, thank you, Don, for your leadership, your perseverance and your vision. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. We will now begin a question-and-answer session."

And all the hard work we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of building the foundation, has produced a level of performance that allows us, we think, to move faster going forward. So you're going to see us focus a lot on 3 core capabilities: customer zeal, digital and sustainability. And we think that's going to allow us to drive growth opportunities certainly in our traditional waste and recycling business, but also more broadly in environmental services over time. And we're going to do that again with a balanced approach on organic and inorganic growth, always with a high toward returns and putting the shareholder at the top of our priority list in terms of how we think about making investments."

But we used to argue about silly things that took time and energy, we don't do anything anymore. So the speed that Jon talks about speed becomes a differentiator, speed becomes a strategic strength. And the speed at which our team now can change. And roll out new things and rise is an example of that speed. So we're gaining speed all the time. And so Jon is starting his new position from a running start. And that really bodes well for the future of the company.

So we remain very disciplined and very focused on price. I think the outlook on price is certainly very strong. As we go forward, I think you're going to see continued momentum on landfill pricing. If that's a place where we're making major investments right in those assets, we continue to prioritize environmental compliance, which is the top of our list, and we need to get a return on those assets. And that's where pricing emanates from the collection side of our business. And then I think just nominally, you'll see our large container pricing improve.

So the weights that are in the large container system. So about 70% of our large container business has a combination of both the hall plus the disposal charge. So lighter container rates drive the average yield calculation, that anniversary is beginning in Q2, which is why we made the commentary that we believe we're going to achieve at least a 2.5% average yield for the full year.

We are very pleased with our strong start to 2021. The momentum in our business is undeniable. Our strong foundation and consistent execution have allowed us to turn that momentum into meaningful sustainable results and shareholder value. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, which represents a 24% increase over the prior year, generated $464 million of adjusted free cash flow and expanded EBITDA margin 270 basis points to 30.7%.
As you know, next month will be my last as CEO at Republic Services. So this will be my final quarterly earnings call with the company. Having said that, I expect the bulk of the questions on today's call to be taken by Jon and Del as they tell you about the solid results in Q1. But also, they will share a glimpse of the future and the exciting trajectory of Republic. I am more than proud of what this team has accomplished over the last decade, and I'm extremely confident in how we are positioned to go forward from here.
Now I could give you a long list of accomplishments and important milestones that we have achieved and frankly, surpassed. I could go on and on about the foundation we have built. More importantly, let me tell you this. The team we have in place is the strongest team in the history of the company. Not only did they establish this foundation we are standing on, but they have the energy and the capability to build it from here. Republic has been tested many times. 2020 was no different. The stability of our business, the power of the portfolio, the capability and dedication of our people were all once again defined and proven. The resiliency and predictability of our operating model and the strength of our culture and the spirit of our people shined brightly.
I have a poster that hangs in my home gym. It's been there for 20 years. It is a simple photograph of an old brick wall with a pair of well-worn boxing gloves hanging on a hook. It displays one of my all-time favorite quotes, ""The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses, behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road long before I dance under those lights."" Those words were attributed to the great and one and only Muhammad Ali. This team, this Republic team, also knows how to prepare for and how to win the fight, and you are seeing that in these results.
Now the 5 most enjoyable things for me as a leader are these: first, casting and collaborating towards a shared vision; second, assembling a purpose-built team; third, creating an effective work environment; fourth, ushering in the future, along with necessary change, new energy and next-gen leaders; fifth and finally, keeping a promise. And so appropriately, this is where I leave you. Republic is on solid ground and operating from a position of strength. Republic has plenty of traction, horsepower and motivation. Republic's leadership is proven, aligned and invigorated. Republic's workforce is professional, well equipped and highly engaged. Republic looks pretty darn good under those lights.
I am so very grateful for the opportunity I've had to serve and to lead here at Republic. To all my teammates and trusted advisers, thank you for your perseverance, passion and your friendship over the years. And to those of you on the phone with us today, the analysts and our investors, I appreciate you putting your faith in us. And thank you for constructively challenging us along the way. It makes us better.
As I have said before, at Republic, we all have the same job. We may have different roles, but we all have the same job. All 35,000 of us are united in support of each other everyday as we safely and reliably serve our customers and our communities and as we responsibly steward our resources.
I know Jon feels the same way. Jon has a clear vision for the road ahead. He also has the strong character and relentless focus to do the hard work that ultimately delivers the victory, which means my role at Republic is concluded and my purpose here is complete. Jon and his team are well on their way to write a wonderful and rewarding new chapter of the Republic story. With that, I'll turn things over to Jon."

I appreciate the kind words, and I'm honored to have this opportunity to be Republic's next CEO.
Now turning to the first quarter results. We continue to see improvement in the business and reported positive revenue growth for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. The pricing environment remains strong, which allowed us to deliver double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion. Total core price was 4.3% and average yield was 2.3%. The core price included open market pricing of 5.2% and restricted pricing of 2.8%. As discussed in our last earnings call, average yield was expected to be relatively lower in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to achieve average yield of at least 2.5% for the full year.
During the first quarter, volume decreased 80 basis points versus the prior year. This is a 100 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter with nearly all lines of business showing improvement. We expect volume to turn positive in the second quarter and remain positive for the remainder of the year. We continue to drive profitable growth and believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.
Earlier today, we closed the acquisition of Santek. We welcome these new employees to the Republic team, and we look forward to integrating these high-quality assets into our business. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is strong, and we remain on track to invest at least $600 million in acquisitions for the full year.
Now turning to our environmental solutions business. First quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $17 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 70 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. We continue to focus on the downstream portion of this business, where customers are looking for integrated solutions and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform.
Moving on to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 75% to $133 per ton in the first quarter. This compared to $76 per ton in the prior year.
Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 30.7% and increased 270 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to successfully manage our costs for changes in underlying demand and leverage our new, more efficient ways of working. This includes utilizing our RISE platform and accelerating the use of technology to drive efficiencies and improve the customer and employee experience.
In the first quarter, we continued our high-performing safety record, reducing safety incidents 18% versus the prior year. We continue to see the positive contribution from our maniacal focus on the customer experience. In the first quarter, our NPS increased 4 points over the prior year, and we achieved a record set in customer retention at 94%.
During the first quarter, we made further progress towards our long-term sustainability goals. As part of our sustainability platform, we recognize the importance of identifying and managing opportunities and risks related to climate change. We remain committed to transparency on metrics that are important to all our stakeholders. We are proud to be the first in the industry to disclose our climate-related opportunities and risks through a comprehensive TCFD report. We were also recently named to Fortune's 2021 Most Admired Companies list. This is an award recognizing our team-focused management, innovation and socially responsible business practices.
Looking ahead, we expect to outperform our original guidance due to our strong start and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year financial guidance as follows: adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.74 to $3.79; and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion.

Additionally, there was 1 less workday, which reduced revenue by 50 basis points compared to the prior year. The components of volume included a decrease in small container volume of 2.8%. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. A decrease in large container volume of 2.1%. This represents a 130 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. And an increase in landfill volume of 2.5%. The increase in landfill volume includes a 3.5% increase in MSW volume and a 1.9% increase in special waste.
Within the quarter, volume performance was negative in January and February and turned positive in March. We expect volume will remain positive for the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 30.7% and increased 270 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 210 basis points, a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices and a 40 basis point benefit from 1 less workday. The outsized margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation and effective cost management.
SG&A expense for the first quarter was 10.2% of revenue, an improvement of 70 basis points over the prior year. While SG&A costs have decreased, expressed in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue, we continue to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million and increased $178 million compared to the prior year. This increase is the result of EBITDA growth, positive contribution from working capital and the timing of capital expenditures. Working capital included a 1-day improvement in DSO and a 2-day improvement in DPO. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million during the first quarter represent 17% of our projected full year spend. The timing benefit of capital expenditures will flip over the remainder of the year.
During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion and total liquidity was $3 billion. Interest expense decreased $18 million as a result of our refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio decreased to 2.9x.
With respect to taxes, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 26%. When you further consider noncash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 28.4%.
I will now turn the call back over to Jon."

He strengthened Republic's foundation while investing in the capabilities that allow us to drive profitable growth and shareholder value.
During the last 10 years, Don has led the company to more than triple our stock price and market capitalization, which now approaches $35 billion.

At the same time, we're at an inflection point, and all the hard work we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of building the foundation has produced a level of performance that allows us, we think, to move faster going forward.
So you're going to see us focus a lot on 3 core capabilities: customer zeal, digital and sustainability. And we think that's going to allow us to drive growth opportunities certainly in our traditional waste and recycling business, but also more broadly in environmental services over time. And we're going to do that again with a balanced approach on organic and inorganic growth, always with an eye toward returns and putting the shareholder at the top of our priority list in terms of how we think about making investments."

We want to wait and see that normal seasonal uptick before we address some of those other assumptions like the price and the volume and the margin. So right now, we feel optimistic about what we see coming out of the first quarter, but we want to see it before we address those assumptions, which we plan to do in July on our second quarter call."

On the operating side, listen, we'll have to see what happens with work-from-home going forward and what traffic patterns do.

And yes, listen, the Santek in terms of the DOJ process and that taking longer, and we said, not really, right, we're still targeting those types of opportunities. There's not a ton of those opportunities versus the smaller tuck-ins, obviously. That's just a kind of a numbers game, but we're not deterred at all from pursuing those types of opportunities. And again, we'll go in eyes wide open in terms of the length of time.

We focus on building the best place, the best people come to work. We're not done yet, you're never done because the world turns, right?

There's waves and waves and generations of really top, talented people here and many who Jon has got his eye on to do their next assignment. So they're really talking a lot about that. That's not ever going to go away. That is embedded in the Republic Way.
They're a broader Republic Way of really getting the best out of our scale and then getting the best out of our local density. When we first started a decade ago, that was -- we were a collection of various companies with -- the trucks were 40 different colors and 35, 50 different names, I don't remember anymore. But we used to argue about silly things that took time and energy. We don't do any of that anymore. So the speed that Jon talks about, speed becomes a differentiator, speed becomes a strategic strength and the speed at which our team now can change and roll out new things. And RISE is an example of that speed. So we're gaining speed all the time.
And so Jon is starting his new position from a running start. And that really bodes well for the future of the company. Many of the things that we've been doing over the last several years, Jon was very involved in. The operating structure of the team that he's inheriting, he has been playing a big part of developing and choosing and directing. So back to speed is going to be a big deal. But Republic Way is not going away. It's just going to get bigger and brighter. It's going to help us -- now he talks about things like customer zeal. We're going to be the best service provider in the space, and people are going to compare us to world-class in the same way they do on safety today and fleet operations and those other things.

Restaurants have been shockingly resilient from our perspective. It doesn't mean there haven't been any closures, but there's been some openings, too. People have expanded their capacity at restaurant as they've started to have outdoor dining combined with their indoor dining, and they're probably going to try to maintain that ground.
And then entertainment, I think that that's going to move, probably going to be the most interesting to watch. I think you're going to see a boom back in some pent-up business travel and personal travel. And everyone's got the Disney vacation and the business conference that has gotten pushed out now for 18 months. That will come back.

Like what are you baking in for cost inflation for the year to be able to get this type of margin expansion but with a yield of 2.5%?"

Look, we're seeing, I would say, in small pockets, so container pricing is going up, for example. And I think regards the outlook for the year, we'll see whatever else happens on the balance of the year. But from a labor standpoint, we feel good. Our turnover number, we think, is in a really attractive spot for us. Again, small pockets here with some subsidization going on with the federal government. We think that abates over the next quarter or beyond. So we feel pretty good on that front. And to the extent the inflation comes in, we'll continue to price in the open market. And so we feel confident that for whatever inflationary pressures we see on the purchased goods side, that we'll certainly be able to recover that more from our open market price."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect strong execution and continued momentum on our strategic priorities which are building capabilities to further differentiate us from competitors. These capabilities include driving growth and building customer loyalty through a maniacal focus on the customer, which we call Customer Zeal, leveraging digital tools to the experience for our customers and employees, which we believe drives growth and generates operational efficiencies and  prioritizing sustainability by offering environmentally responsible solutions to our customers while protecting the planet. 
During the second quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which represents a 36% increase over the prior year, expanded EBITDA margin of 110 basis points to 30.6% and generated $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders. 
Year-to-date, we invested $567 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust with opportunities in both solid waste and the Environmental Solutions portion of our business. We expect to invest well over $600 million in acquisitions for the full year. 
Year-to-date, we returned $363 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and  our Board recently approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. The strength of the underlying business is irrefutable, and we continue to see the proof points that our strategy is working. Retention in our small and large container business remains at historically high levels at 94%. 
If you further consider all permanent units of service, retention is even higher at 95%.  As anticipated, the pricing environment was strong in the second quarter. Total core price was 5.2% and average yield was 2.6%. This level of core price matches the highest level in our company's history. 
During the second quarter, we delivered outsized growth in our business as the economy improved. Second quarter volume increased 8.1% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations. The outlook for growth in the remainder of the year, both organically and through acquisitions is strong. 
Turning to digital. We continue to see the benefit of our investments in technology and are well underway on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. Through the second quarter, we implemented tablets in approximately 40% -- 47% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022. 
The in-cab tablets enable automated customer notifications, which provides customers real-time information about their service. Next,  we believe sustainability is more than environmental stewardship but also a platform for growth. We recently published our new sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making in our most significant opportunities to positively impact our stakeholders and the environment. For example, we are proud to report a 5% reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to the prior year. This year, we expanded and converted a landfill gas energy plant to high BTU and have 15 additional projects in the pipeline. These projects reduce landfill emissions generate more renewable and improve our economics. We are also making the communities in which we operate better places to live. 
So far this year, we've supported more than 25 charitable efforts and neighborhood revitalization projects through financial contributions and volunteer efforts. This is in addition to the ongoing support of our local divisions to provide to their communities. In recognition of our ESG performance and transparency, we were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the second consecutive year. 
Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect continued strength in our business and to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. According, we are updating full year financial guidance as follows:  adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $4 to $4.05 and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in a range of [ $1.45 billion to  $1.475 billion ]. This represents an increase of over 6% from the midpoint of the prior guidance. 
I will now turn the call over to Brian."
386225,718895909,2355406,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Second quarter core price was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 3%. Core price in the open market was the highest level in company history.

Second quarter core price was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 3%. Core price in the open market was the highest level in company history. The components of core price included small container of 7.9%, large container of 5.3% and residential of 5%. Average yield was 2.6%, which increased 30 basis points from the first quarter. This level of performance was in line with our expectations. 
Second quarter volume increased 8.1%. While we expected second quarter to be the highest reported volume for the year, the 8.1% growth exceeded our expectations. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 8.6% and an increase in large container of 13.7% and an increase in landfill of 12.6%. 
For reference, Second quarter volumes in our small and large container businesses were down less than 1% from a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. And MSW and C&D landfill volumes were both above the pre-pandemic baseline. 
Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices increased to $170 per ton in the second quarter. This compared to $101 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 100 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. 
Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was essentially flat with the prior year. Approximately 30% of our Environmental Solutions business is in the upstream oil and gas sector and 70% is in the downstream petrochemical and broader industrial manufacturing sectors. The downstream petrochemical and industrial manufacturing portion of this business grew 8% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 30.6% and increased 110 basis points over the prior year. This included 130 basis points, a 50 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel. The margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation realizing operating leverage as volumes return and continued effective cost management. 
SG&A was 10.7% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year. SG&A included higher levels of incentive compensation due to projected financial outperformance. SG&A would have been approximately 10%, excluding the additional incentive compensation expenses. 
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion, and increased $276 million or 38% compared to the prior year. The drivers of growth included EBITDA growth in the business, a positive contribution from a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and the timing of capital expenditures. We received approximately 40% of our projected full year FX during the first half of the year. 
During the quarter, total debt was $9 billion and total liquidity was $2.9 billion. Interest expense decreased $13 million due to refinancing activities completed last year. And our leverage ratio was 2.9x. 
With respect to taxes, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 23.7%,  which include noncash charges from solar investments. We'll expect a full year equivalent tax impact of 26% and which includes the effective tax rate and noncash solar charges. 
With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter. Our results reflect strong execution and continued momentum on our strategic priorities which are building capabilities to further differentiate us from competitors. These capabilities include: driving growth and building customer loyalty through a maniacal focus on the customer, which we call Customer Zeal; leveraging digital tools to the experience for our customers and employees, which we believe drives growth and generates operational efficiencies; and  prioritizing sustainability by offering environmentally responsible solutions to our customers while protecting the planet. 
During the second quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which represents a 36% increase over the prior year, expanded EBITDA margin of 110 basis points to 30.6%, and generated $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders. 
Year-to-date, we invested $567 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust, with opportunities in both solid waste and the Environmental Solutions portion of our business. We expect to invest well over $600 million in acquisitions for the full year. 
Year-to-date, we returned $363 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and our Board recently approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. The strength of the underlying business is irrefutable, and we continue to see the proof points that our strategy is working. Retention in our small and large container business remains at historically high levels at 94%. If you further consider all permanent units of service, retention is even higher at 95%. 
As anticipated, the pricing environment was strong in the second quarter. Total core price was 5.2%, and average yield was 2.6%. This level of core price matches the highest level in our company's history. During the second quarter, we delivered outsized growth in our business as the economy improved. Second quarter volume increased 8.1% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations. The outlook for growth in the remainder of the year, both organically and through acquisitions, is strong. 
Turning to digital. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in technology and are well underway on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. Through the second quarter, we implemented tablets in approximately 40% -- 47% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022. The in-cab tablets enable automated customer notifications, which provides customers real-time information about their service. 
Next, we believe sustainability is more than environmental stewardship but also a platform for growth. We recently published our new sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making in our most significant opportunities to positively impact our stakeholders and the environment. For example, we are proud to report a 5% reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to the prior year. This year, we expanded and converted a landfill gas energy plant to high BTU and have 15 additional projects in the pipeline. These projects reduce landfill emissions, generate more renewable and improve our economics. 
We are also making the communities in which we operate better places to live. So far this year, we've supported more than 25 charitable efforts and neighborhood revitalization projects through financial contributions and volunteer efforts. This is in addition to the ongoing support of our local divisions provide to their communities. In recognition of our ESG performance and transparency, we were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the second consecutive year. 
Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect continued strength in our business and to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we are updating full year financial guidance as follows. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $4 to $4.05, and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.475 billion. This represents an increase of over 6% from the midpoint of the prior guidance. 
I will now turn the call over to Brian."

Second quarter core price was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 3%. Core price in the open market was the highest level in company history. The components of core price included small container of 7.9%, large container of 5.3% and residential of 5%. Average yield was 2.6%, which increased 30 basis points from the first quarter. This level of performance was in line with our expectations. 
Second quarter volume increased 8.1%. While we expected second quarter to be the highest reported volume for the year, the 8.1% growth exceeded our expectations. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 8.6%, an increase in large container of 13.7% and an increase in landfill of 12.6%. For reference, second quarter volumes in our small and large container businesses were down less than 1% from a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, and MSW and C&D landfill volumes were both above the pre-pandemic baseline. 
Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices increased to $170 per ton in the second quarter. This compared to $101 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 100 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. 
Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was essentially flat with the prior year. Approximately 30% of our Environmental Solutions business is in the upstream oil and gas sector, and 70% is in the downstream petrochemical and broader industrial manufacturing sectors. The downstream petrochemical and industrial manufacturing portion of this business grew 8% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 30.6% and increased 110 basis points over the prior year. This included 130 basis points, a 50 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel. The margin expansion is a direct result of pricing in excess of our cost inflation realizing operating leverage as volumes return, and continued effective cost management. 
SG&A was 10.7% of revenue, which was flat with the prior year. SG&A included higher levels of incentive compensation due to projected financial outperformance. SG&A would have been approximately 10%, excluding the additional incentive compensation expenses. 
Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion and increased $276 million or 38% compared to the prior year. The drivers of growth included EBITDA growth in the business, a positive contribution from a 1.5-day improvement in DSO and the timing of capital expenditures. We received approximately 40% of our projected full year CapEx during the first half of the year. 
During the quarter, total debt was $9 billion, and total liquidity was $2.9 billion. Interest expense decreased $13 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.9x. 
With respect to taxes, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.6%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 23.7% if you include noncash charges from solar investments. We'll expect a full year equivalent tax impact of 26%, which includes the effective tax rate and noncash solar charges.

Well, broadly speaking, we'll look to partner, not because we can't do it ourselves. We do, do that in a handful of cases. I just think about our resources and it's less financial capital, it's more of our talent. I don't want to tie up all of our time and energy in a place where I think it will be a nice ancillary revenue stream, certainly profitable for us, but it doesn't provide exponential growth, right?

We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities of customer zeal, digital and sustainability to drive growth and value for our stakeholders. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 14% compared to the prior year. Generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year and produced $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. 
We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've invested over $900 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. On August 31, we completed the acquisition of [indiscernible]. This strategic acquisition broadens our capabilities and offerings in the environmental services industry. 
It also provides us with a platform to pursue additional growth. We are excited to welcome ACV to the Republic team. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in both the recycling and solid waste and the environmental solutions businesses. We now expect to invest over $1 billion in acquisitions for the full year. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we have returned $622 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize customer zeal to drive profitable growth. This includes increasing customer loyalty, driving willingness to pay and attracting new volume as the provider of choice. 
Our customer retention rate remains at a record-setting level of 95%. During the third quarter, we delivered outsized revenue growth throughout our business. Total core price remained at an all-time high of 5.2%, and average yield increased to 3.2%. Volume increased 4.3% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations. And acquisitions contributed an incremental 350 basis points to total revenue growth. The outlook for organic and acquisition growth for the remainder of the year is strong. 
Turning to digital. We continue to realize the benefits of our investments in technology. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. We have now implemented tablets in approximately 70% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022. Next, turning to our sustainability platform. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. 
We currently have 17 projects in the pipeline with more opportunities thereafter. On top of the royalty revenue, these plants will generate a majority of equity investment opportunities to further participate in the project economics. We also recently opened a solar project on one of our closed landfills in Bellevue, Illinois. This project consists of 30,000 solar panels and will produce enough energy to power 2,200 homes annually. 
We remain committed to increasing the recycling and circularity of key materials as part of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals. We recently opened the first solar-powered compost facility in California to further our progress and address the growing community needs. This facility will provide critical organic processing capabilities to residents and businesses in the greater San Diego area. 
Our strong financial and operational results will not have been possible without our dedicated Republic employees. We continue to invest in developing both existing and new talent and creating innovative solutions for the increased demand for skilled workers. We recently unveiled our Republic Services Technical Institute, which is the industry's first ever diesel technician school. This subsidized program is already building a strong pipeline of high demand technician talent for Republic. 
Additionally, graduates will have upskilling opportunities to further grow their career with Republic. These types of innovative investments in talent lead to external recognition for our company. Republic was recently certified as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. This is a meaningful achievement as employee recruiting and retention remains a prominent focus in today's labor market. 
Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the continued strength in our business, we now expect to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we are increasing 2021 full year financial guidance as follows: adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.13; and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to Brian."

The components of core price included small container of 8.2%, large container of 5% and residential of 5%. Average yield was 3.2%, which increased 60 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter volume increased 4.3%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 5.4%, an increase in large container of 3.9% and an increase in landfill of 6.6%. 
For reference, small container and MSW volumes in the third quarter were both above a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices increased to $230 per tonne in the third quarter. This compares to $99 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 160 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Third quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $27 million from the prior year. 
This was driven by both organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 30.4%, increased 10 basis points over the prior year. This included a 90 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 50 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 30 basis point headwind from the impact of recent acquisitions, primarily driven by deal and integration costs. 
SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year, which was exclusively due to higher incentive compensation accruals. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion and increased [indiscernible] or 22% compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by EBITDA growth in the business. With respect to our full year cash flow guidance, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. 
It should also be noted that we increased our expected full year capital spending in our upwardly revised guidance by over $50 million. This increase relates to capital to support growth opportunities. Free cash flow conversion through September continued to track ahead of our original expectations and increased 330 basis points over the prior year. During the quarter, total debt was $9.3 billion, and total liquidity was $2.4 billion. 
Interest expense decreased $11 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.8x. With respect to taxes, our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 27% when you include noncash charges from solar investments. We expect our fourth quarter equivalent tax impact to be approximately 25%. This includes the effective tax rate and noncash solar charges. I will now turn the call back over to Jon."

And look, if we're growing in a different way than we ever have before. And over time, we think that gives us leverage on SG&A, which further helps with the margin expansion."

So we start with everything on intrinsic value returns, right? That's where we start from a fundamental standpoint. Any deal we do is going to have to clear that hurdle, right, individually and then naturally, collectively, it will over time as a platform. These businesses, in general, do have a lower margin profile than recycling and solid waste. They also have a different capital intensity. So when you think about free cash flow conversion, right, it looks very similar. 
And we do think there's certainly an opportunity to raise those margins over time. And again, we have been incredibly consistent over the last decade on our commitment to pricing, right? And that we won't flinch back off of that, right, as we grow in the broader environmental services space, right? We are going to be able to price because we're going to provide a differentiated service, and that supports us not only giving a fair wage increase to our employees, but then expanding margins and providing great returns to our shareholders over time."

We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities of customer zeal, digital and sustainability to drive growth and value for our stakeholders. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 14% compared to the prior year. Generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year and produced $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.
We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value-creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've invested over $900 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. On August 31, we completed the acquisition of ACV Enviro. This strategic acquisition broadens our capabilities and offerings in the environmental services industry.
It also provides us with a platform to pursue additional growth. We are excited to welcome ACV to the Republic team. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in both the recycling and solid waste and the environmental solutions businesses. We now expect to invest over $1 billion in acquisitions through the full year. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we have returned $622 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
We continue to prioritize customer zeal to drive profitable growth. This includes increasing customer loyalty, driving willingness to pay and attracting new volume as the provider of choice. Our customer retention rate remains at a record-setting level of 95%. During the third quarter, we delivered outsized revenue growth throughout our business. Total core price remained at an all-time high of 5.2%, and average yield increased to 3.2%. Volume increased 4.3% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations. And acquisitions contributed an incremental 350 basis points to total revenue growth. The outlook for organic and acquisition growth for the remainder of the year is strong.
Turning to digital. We continue to realize the benefits of our investments in technology. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. We have now implemented tablets in approximately 70% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2022. 
Next, turning to our sustainability platform. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We currently have 17 projects in the pipeline with more opportunities thereafter. On top of the royalty revenue, these plants will generate a majority of equity investment opportunities to further participate in the project economics. We also recently opened a solar project on one of our closed landfills in Belleville, Illinois. This project consists of 30,000 solar panels and will produce enough energy to power 2,200 homes annually.
We remain committed to increasing the recycling and circularity of key materials as part of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goal. We recently opened the first solar-powered compost facility in California to further our progress and address the growing community needs. This facility will provide critical organic processing capabilities to residents and businesses in the greater San Diego area.
Our strong financial and operational results will not have been possible without our dedicated Republic employees. We continue to invest in developing both existing and new talent and creating innovative solutions for the increased demand for skilled workers. We recently unveiled our Republic Services Technical Institute, which is the industry's first ever diesel technician school. This subsidized program is already building a strong pipeline of high demand technician talent for Republic.
Additionally, graduates will have upskilling opportunities to further grow their career with Republic. These types of innovative investments in talent lead to external recognition for our company. Republic was recently certified as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. This is a meaningful achievement as employee recruiting and retention remains a prominent focus in today's labor market. 
Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the continued strength in our business, we now expect to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we are increasing 2021 full year financial guidance as follows: adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.13; and adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to Brian."

Core price during the third quarter was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.2%, large container of 5% and residential of 5%. Average yield was 3.2%, which increased 60 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter volume increased 4.3%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 5.4%, an increase in large container of 3.9% and an increase in landfill of 6.6%.
For reference, small container and MSW volumes in the third quarter were both above a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices increased to $230 per ton in the third quarter. This compares to $99 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 160 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. 
Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $27 million from the prior year. This was driven by both organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 30.4%, and increased 10 basis points over the prior year. This included a 90 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 50 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 30 basis point headwind from the impact of recent acquisitions, primarily driven by deal and integration costs.
SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year, which was exclusively due to higher incentive compensation accruals. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion and increased $247 million or 22% compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by EBITDA growth in the business. With respect to our full year cash flow guidance, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter.
It should also be noted that we increased our expected full year capital spending in our upwardly revised guidance by over $50 million. This increase relates to capital to support growth opportunities. Free cash flow conversion through September continued to track ahead of our original expectations and increased 330 basis points over the prior year. During the quarter, total debt was $9.3 billion, and total liquidity was $2.4 billion. Interest expense decreased $11 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.8x. 
With respect to taxes, our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 27% when you include noncash charges from solar investments. We expect our fourth quarter equivalent tax impact to be approximately 25%. This includes the effective tax rate and noncash solar charges. I will now turn the call back over to Jon."

And on the volume side, listen, we certainly left some volume on the table. If we had more labor, we would have gone after some more opportunities on that front. So very strong demand environment.

And we think that modulates over time. 
Certainly, some -- with the Delta variant, we had some elevated PTO costs, right, in the quarter of people who were sitting out and still getting paid over time. So that's a headwind that abates over time. Listen, as traffic patterns come back, does that slow us down a little bit? Maybe. I would have guessed we would have seen a lot of that, but our RISE platform is really delivering a lot of productivity into the business. And then more from a central function standpoint, we'll shrink our real estate footprint incrementally here as we have some of our more transactional colleagues working from home permanently. But that's pretty modest broad strokes. Get a little bit of travel, come back. But we'll also take advantage of Teams and do things in different ways over time.

And why I say this? We have a limited number of landfills. And so this is a great growth opportunity for us to pursue, but there is a ceiling to it. Once you've kind of built it out on all the landfills that make sense, that's it. We like to put our -- all of our financial capital and our human capital in places that we can grow in an evergreen way. And so that's what we'll put our attention.

So people have -- and focusing in parallel on employee engagement and making sure this is the place that the best people come to work.
So you put those 2 things together. And we think our employee value proposition has been really strong. And while turnover has been elevated, it's been modestly elevated, right? And we've really -- we would have taken more people if we could, to pursue some incremental growth opportunities, but our retention has been really strong. 
Now that being said, we're facing the same pressures in the macro environment. So we've looked and done surgery in targeted markets where we think we weren't as competitive or maybe turnover was elevated. But you kind of take those cost increases and you offset it with, what we think, is our digital ops and our RISE platform, which is really driving productivity. And we look at our performance kind of in the quarter versus 2019, right, we're just seeing we're getting more work, right, out of the same labor hour.
And that's been really productive. And I think you're seeing it hold in a very challenging environment. And then on top of that, of course, we're pricing because the market bears it, and we want to support future wage increases for our employees."

Great set of assets, gets us into certainly some geographic markets that we weren't in before. And that creates a basis or a platform for further growth, both organic and additional tuck-in acquisitions. 
As Brian mentioned, there's always startup costs in the first year. And the bigger the deal, the more of the start-up costs because we really then have to get multiple sites and the systems integrated, and there's a lot of employee benefits and related costs.
And we really try to front-load all those and get all those done at once. A, to get those behind us; but b, the great employee experience. And so if those linger forever, they feel like they're not really part of the company, we think that leads to higher turnover time. So we get after that and have a very proactive and intentional plan. And we're ahead of that plan. And I think you'll see in '22 that will be a nice certainly tailwind for us as those costs come behind us.

And then -- listen, we maintain a perspective on everything. So could there be some larger deals that come through over time? Yes, those are obviously more episodic and could be challenging from a regulatory review. On balance, we have a very crystal clear point of view of where the regulation sits. And so if we think there's a deal that really is not going to get through, we just don't spend energy and time pursuing that opportunity.
And -- or if we do have limited regulatory scrutiny on a deal, we bake that right in. We understand what we probably have to divest, and we go right to the regulators and say, here's our perspective, and again, they can -- they'll draw their own perspective.

In a world where plastics, for example, the consumer packages companies are really in a need for post-consumer content and we have it, and we're an aggregator. So over time, that material is more valued, and we think we're going to be able to capture a piece of that as we move forward. 
And the other thing I'd add, Jerry, there's plenty of opportunities on our existing facilities to drive in more automation to kind of change the CapEx and OpEx trade-off. Those are tough jobs. Those are higher turnover jobs. And so it allows us to reduce the labor forces incrementally in those facilities, but then also produce a better product with more state of the art equipment."

Fuel was a drag in the quarter, right, that in general, we price fuel and our fuel recovery fee is a pretty good broad hedge to fuel, but we have a little bit of a drag as we go up, and then it happens we have a little bit of a lag as we go back down.
So depending on where fuel goes. But I'd say there's probably more chance that's a neutral or a tailwind at it in the next year. And then acquisitions, like I said, right, we kind of loaded up all those integration costs in the first year. And so we expect that to be a little bit of headwind to the overall margin for a portion of that headwind in the equation into next year, but nothing dramatic, right? We're still committed to expanding margins next year with all those pieces put together."
