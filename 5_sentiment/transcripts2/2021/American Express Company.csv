And while we're still seeing the impacts",1327,"Thanks, Vivian. Good morning, and belated Happy New Year to everyone, and hope you and your families are healthy and safe. 
As you saw, we earned $1.76 per share or $9.35 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. And while we're still seeing the impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business, the trends have steadily improved as the year went on. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had little visibility into the future. But we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty, focusing on 4 priorities: supporting our colleagues, protecting our customers and our brand, remaining financially strong, and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer-term growth. 
We've made substantial progress against each of these priorities. As I talked about last quarter, we see this cycle playing out in 3 phases. Phase 1 has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty, which is what we focused on for most of 2020. We are now solidly in phase 2, which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum. Our goal in Phase 2 is to prepare us for phase 3, a return to pre COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm. 
Our progress in managing through phase 1 confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model. Key elements of this model, such as the diversity and scale of our customer base, our brand, our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase. As we've seen throughout this period, our customers have been resilient and adaptive. Since the lows in mid-April, overall card member spending has steadily improved. Our card members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and card-not-present spending. 
Non-T&E spending recovered to pre COVID levels in Q3 and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in Q4. Consumer holiday spending was up 11% globally year-over-year, exhibiting particularly strong online growth of 40%. In addition, our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers. Attrition rates in our proprietary products remain lower than last year, and our customer satisfaction levels remain above pre COVID levels. We again ranked #1 in J.D. Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers for the 10th time in the 14 years the study has been conducted. 
Throughout the year, our merchant network continue to grow globally. We sustained virtual parity coverage in the United States and we added more than 3.7 million merchant locations internationally in 2020. Credit performance continued to be outstanding, thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities and the quick adjustments we've made as the pandemic hit. 
Our Q4 delinquencies and write-offs are at some of the lowest levels we've seen in a few years and are best-in-class. Our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period. And our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic that -- which was brought to their -- which has been brought to their lives at work and at home. 
All in all, I feel good about all that we accomplished in 2020 and some of the highlights of which you can see on Slide 2. I am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward. That being said, the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the short term. The pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed. For us, the timing of how quickly we can get to phase 3 and return to pre-pandemic levels of earnings is also tied to a recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending, and therefore, dependent on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again. 
We continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to pre COVID levels. We just can't predict right now how quickly. Given this environment, we are looking at 2021 as a transition year during which our focus will be on building -- rebuilding growth momentum. By rebuilding growth momentum, we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines, scaling key next horizon opportunities and retaining the flexibility in our financial model. 
To accomplish this, we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following. In our Consumer and Commercial businesses, we plan to continue to ramp up our card member acquisition activities, inject additional value into targeted products and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products. Additionally, in our Commercial business, we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card. A few examples of how we're doing this include the work already underway to integrate and relaunch Kabbage's suite of products, including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our AP Automation Solutions, where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone. 
On the network side, we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally. We're also investing in enhancements to our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in China. 
Finally, we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses. The nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features, services and experiences we rolled out in 2020 and over the past several years, and we think these trends are here to stay. 
At a high level, those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future. 
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, let me end with a few words about how we're thinking about our financial performance in 2021 and beyond. On last quarter's earnings call, I talked about how my confidence in the long term was growing, though the near term remains harder to predict. Today, I'm even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and long term, but I'm still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in 2021. 
As I discussed, our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum. With this in mind, we will not be focused on a particular EPS target in 2021, though Jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes. In reflecting on COVID's impact on the economy and our business in 2020 and where we are as we begin 2021, we look at this 2-year period as a pause in the growth momentum we had been generating for the previous 10 consecutive quarters before the pandemic began. 
As a result, we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward. I believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration. 
The foundation of our business is solid, our brand, customer relationships and partnerships are strong. Our colleagues are focused and committed, and we have shown that we can adapt to rapidly changing conditions. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and then we'll take your questions after that. Thank you for your time."

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how you're thinking about the future with some scenarios, potential outcomes for 2021. 
Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Our results in the fourth quarter continue to improve sequentially, but we're still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, while card fee revenues continued to grow. 
Net income was $1.4 billion, and earnings per share was $1.76 in the fourth quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Now as I've said over the past 3 quarters, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends. So I'll again spend the most time on these 2 topics. 
Turning to the details of our volumes. First, let's start with billed business, which you will see several views of on Slides 4 through 10. The rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since September. And so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our build business slides since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful due to the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays. 
Starting with Slide 4. Overall billed business declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our proprietary billed business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was down that same 16%, and the remaining 14% of our overall billings which comes from our network business, GNS, was down 15% in the fourth quarter, all on an FX-adjusted basis. 
When you look at our billed business performance in 2020 and think about what this might mean for 2021, it's important to think about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends, as you can see on Slide 5. 
Non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes, hit a trough in the second quarter but was back above pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as our card members, particularly consumers and SMEs, have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment. 
T&E spending, on the other hand, has remained down much more significantly, declining 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, though it did show some continued modest sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic, non-T&E spending was around 70% of our proprietary billed business. And today, it represents almost 90%, as you can see on Slide 6. 
Looking at the billings mix by customer type at the bottom of the slide, you see that the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our Consumer business, and that is even more true today. Taking a closer look at T&E on Slide 7, you see that consumer T&E continue to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent-up demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations that corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time. 
We also continue to see different paces of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business, have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines, but both showed modest improvement sequentially in Q4. Restaurant spending, on the other hand, has been the most resilient throughout, decelerated slightly during Q4 due to colder weather in the U.S. and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies. 
Moving on to Global Consumer on Slide 8. We continue to see an acceleration in online and card-not-present spend growth throughout 2020, especially during the holiday season, which drove 5% growth in non-T&E spending in the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to our Global Commercial Billed business on Slide 9, non-T&E spending has returned to pre COVID levels and grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within our Commercial segment, you continue to see a tale of 2 very different customer types. Spending from small and medium-sized enterprise customers who historically have the highest mix of non-T&E spending has been the most resilient throughout 2020. Whereas large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily T&E, has been down the most during the pandemic. 
I will remind you here that spending from our SME customers now represents 86% of our Commercial Billed business. You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions on Slide 10, which have more travel-related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a favorably similar pattern, which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic. 
To sum up on volumes, we feel good about the pace of recovery in non-T&E spending throughout 2020 and expect it will continue to grow steadily in 2021. But more broadly in 2021, our overall volume recovery to pre-pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with T&E since non-T&E has already substantially recovered. While we currently expect spending in Q1 '21 to remain relatively in line with Q4 of 2020, upside of some impact from normal seasonality, our current assumption is that by Q4 of 2021, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of Q4 2019 levels. 
Moving next to loans and receivables. On Slide 11, loan and receivable balances were up 4% and 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays. However, loan and receivable volumes were down 17% and 24% year-over-year, respectively, in the fourth quarter driven by the continued declines in spending volumes that I just spoke. We also continue to see higher paydown rates from revolving card members on our credit cards. 
Looking forward into 2021, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes if the higher paydown rate trends we saw in 2020 continue. In addition, I'd remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year due to seasonal spending patterns. 
Turning next to our traditional credit metrics on Slide 12, you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with card member loans and receivable write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 30% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. In addition, our write-off and delinquency rates continued to be down year-over-year and down sequentially in the fourth quarter, reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates we've seen in several years for both card member loans and receivables. 
Looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 13, those balances continue to decline sequentially to $4 billion at the end of Q4 and now stand $1.2 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. Historically, the credit outcomes of card members that are enrolling in these programs are better than delinquent card members that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience. 
It is unusual to see credit performance be strong in an environment like this. It all starts with the changes we've made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which give us a solid or gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilized our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance. Of course, like others, our customers are also helped by external factors such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. 
As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. And that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves. Moving on to Slide 14, you will see that the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in the modeling of CECL reserves for the expected lifetime losses of the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenarios since Q3. But the 2 scenarios do remain sharply [indiscernible]. 
In our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter, we continue to weight heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that I just spoke about. Despite this caution, the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release $674 million of reserves in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 15. 
This reserve release, coupled with our low write-offs, drove a provision expense benefit of $111 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $5.8 billion of reserves, representing 7.3% of our loan balances, 0.6% of our Card Member receivables balances, respectively. We believe that the reserves on our balance sheet, which are up $1.5 billion from the pre-pandemic levels, are appropriate, giving the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. 
Turning now to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 16. Fourth quarter revenues were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, while net card fees continued to grow, as you can see on Slide 17. 
Net card fee growth remains strong throughout 2020 and grew 12% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued card member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter. 
Although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll continue to increase investments in this area this year, it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate. As a result, I do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate. 
Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield. On Slide 18, net interest income declined 17% on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter. Net interest yield on our card member loans increased 10 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk, mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances. 
Looking forward, I'd expect net interest income to be relatively flat to Q4 in the first quarter and then increase modestly as loan volumes recover. 
Turning next to our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This difference drove an 11 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since. As a reminder, we, on average, earn higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. The discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward into 2021, I'd expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of T&E recovery. Coming back to total revenues. On Slide 20, you see that the overall revenue trends in 2020 have broadly moved in line with billed business trends given the spend centric nature of our business model. While I would expect first quarter 2021 revenues to be broadly in line with Q4 outside of some impact from seasonality, if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned earlier, you'll probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. 
And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you would see full year revenue growth that's somewhat lower or higher than that 9% to 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 21. We're continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 24% for the full year, driven by lower spending and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a 50% offset to the full year revenue declines we saw in 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, that offset was closer to 40% as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. And I would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of 2021. 
Moving on to the marketing expense line. We invested $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we could spend as much as a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this year. 
Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions. 
Turning to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 6% year-over-year in 2020 as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our long-term strategies. In 2021, we expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum. 
Last, while you saw some quarterly volatility this year in our effective tax rate, the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below 23% and I'd expect around a 23% effective tax rate in 2021, absent any legislative changes. 
Turning next to capital and liquidity on Slide 22. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have been all year. Our CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.5% after hitting in the third quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the year at $54.6 billion and has been at record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet. 
We remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity and periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. We plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum Fed authorized capacity of around $440 million in Q1. Beyond Q1, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. 
To sum up, we feel good about how we've navigated through the unprecedented challenges of 2020, and we feel well positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in 2021. We now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment. The 2 areas that do remain harder to predict for 2021, though, are the same 2 we have talked about since the pandemic began: the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in T&E spending, as I mentioned earlier. 
That said, the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in 2021. And so on Slide 23, we have outlined 2 scenarios. Most importantly, scenario 1 assumes that the caution we have shown in our Q4 credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted. Such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4, and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low is around $5. 
Scenario 2, most importantly, assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery, leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery. The combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger EPS outcome in the area of $7. 
In either scenario, our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum, along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts, not by focusing on a specific EPS outcome. We run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the long term. Although we can't predict precisely where 2021 EPS will land or provide an EPS guidance range at this time, we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022. And for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

But we're in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year. I mean, when we were talking last year at any given point in time, we didn't have a vaccine. 
And so while the vaccine right now is, what I would call, it's fits and starts. I mean, is there enough -- at the beginning, there wasn't enough places to sort of -- to do vaccine distribution. Now they have vaccine distribution points, but you don't have -- you don't have enough vaccine to distribute, hard to get appointments, there's -- so there's a lot of disconnect. That will sort itself out. And it will sort itself out over a period of a couple of months, not over a couple of years. 
And so we believe that by June or so, you will either have sort of a herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity. The other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pent-up demand for travel. It's probably -- and nobody on this call that doesn't want to travel or go someplace or don't know their friends or family don't want to do the same thing. And so when we look at it, I don't think you'll see a widespread international travel. But you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being domestic travel here in the United States, domestic travel sort of within the European Union, things like that. You're probably not going to see a lot of long-haul this year. 
And so look, I'm fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel. I mean, we're talking about consumer travel potentially being back about 80% with overall travel being back about 70%. Business travel will come back a little bit slower. But I'd be shocked if we're sitting here at this time next year and we say, geez, well, we really missed it on travel. I just don't see that happening. I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines. But again, these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace. 
I mean, what do you have? Like 20 million people in the United States at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that. And it's only January. And so I believe that as we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel. I think cruise lines, that's more of a 2022 phenomenon. So we feel really good about consumer travel coming back. I think our airline partner with Delta, Ed said the same thing on his earnings call. So we feel real confident about that. 
And as far as new cards, I mean, look, new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix. But what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast, not the scenarios, is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because you're not going to have those card members traveling right out of the gate, it will probably be more of a second half phenomenon. And so their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal. 
Having said that, we are really focused on getting -- we don't talk a lot about cards, but cards lead to build business acquired, which we do talk a lot about. We are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine, and we believe there are a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards."

We're essentially at",368,"Sanjay, I'll add 2 things on cards and then talk about reserves. I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. Consumer business our Platinum and Gold new card member acquisition numbers. We're essentially at 2019 levels. That's a really good sign to us. The other point I'd make is just to reiterate what Steve said is that it's really a 2022 impact. To a great extent. 2021 is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers. It won't affect the 2021 results that much because the 2021 results, then to go to your last question or all about what happens. It's credit. 
And I guess I'd encourage everyone to think about 2 numbers. So I cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year, we now end the year with $1.5 billion more in credit reserves. We also, relative to the beginning of the year, ended the year with $1.2 billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs. And yet I also pointed out that historically, 80% of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs, we end up collecting and doing fine with. 
So what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook. And so you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy. Small businesses going bankrupt, lots of consumers being laid off, you have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed. So we're not making an economic call, Sanjay. We're saying, well, if all that bad stuff happens, like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast, then we're going to need all those reserves we have on the books, and you're probably -- that's sort of where the low scenario comes from. 
Conversely, if -- while rocky, there's a fairly steady recovery, we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario. So we'll have to see. But either way, our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year because it's all about 2022."

I mean, when we look at new card acquisition, our Platinum and our Gold levels were at levels of 2019. And so we feel really good about that. I think our Cash Back cards were actually doing quite well as well. What we have not seen, and this makes all the sense in the world, is our co-brand -- our co-brand acquisition. And our co-brand acquisition, I mean, look, the reason you do co-brand cards, you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners, but you also get tremendous distribution. And right now, not a lot of people stay in hotels, not a lot of people are taking flights. So you lose the distribution opportunities. 
Having said that, what our co-brand cards, though, are performing either in the United States or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective because, as I've said, all along, people spend to gather those points to take those trips because they have such a pent-up demand for travel. And our retention numbers on our co-brand cards are at the same levels they were in 2019. So we feel good about proprietary acquisition, which again, is being driven by Platinum and Gold and some Cash Back. Our co-brand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our -- the co-brand channels. 
But having said that, our co-brand performance is really, really good. And Ed made that comment and [indiscernible] made that comment in his earnings remarks as well.

And so if you have that as your baseline, then I think we're right within where we want to be. And the key thing that we need to do is -- and we've said this as we went through both of our remarks, our investment levels will be higher than they've ever been. That's our plan. We are planning, provided we have and we have light to -- we see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of investment opportunities, we will continue to invest and take advantage of all those investment opportunities that are available to us. If they're not there, we'll pull back. But we believe they will be there. We will look to ramp up our card acquisition. We will look at value injection early on in the year. We'll look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year. We're going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the United States. We're going to drive really hard at international acceptance. 
I mean, look, we signed 3.7 million merchants internationally last year, not including China. Take China off the table for a second, but we're going to drive international acceptance, as we've said. We're going to continue to work and invest in our network. We're going to launch Kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers. And we're going to get some traction in China as well. So we are really focused in 2021 in investing across all dimensions of our -- each one of our business lines and preparing ourselves for 2022 by building that strong foundation of retaining card members, acquiring new ones and building that merchant network, continuing to build up network capabilities and digital capabilities. We believe with the healthy economy and T&E consumer spending just about fully recovered, we'll be within our range."

I mean what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company, which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing. And we have a very clear plan in 2021 to manage those to provide $11.5 billion. That is below 2019 levels. If you were to look at some businesses we've sold over the years, it's frankly about where the number was a decade ago, in 2012 and 2013. 
So I think -- we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what I think of as the infrastructure cost of the company, which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow, there's tremendous leverage from holding that a little below 2019 level. There's always a little bit of quarterly noise, particularly the Q4, some of the lines in OpEx, you'll see every year, if you go back and look at history, go up a little bit. But that's the disciplined approach that we're taking here. So I don't know if I got to the number of your question, Rick, but that's probably how we think about it."

The other thing I would add is that if you look at this number on the face of it, it's pretty much the same number we've had in 2012 from an operating expense perspective.

But yet, the business is very different than it was in 2012. We're focused on different things. We've acquired a bunch of companies, which are in here. And our focus has been completely different. So I think the team has done a really good job of, on an ongoing basis, taking expense out and then putting in investment back in. And so as you think about this, what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base. And the way we look at it, that's providing us leverage. So if we think about the core business that we had, we're getting enough leverage out there to fund other opportunities within the business, whether that be Kabbage, whether that be the acquisition of a Mezi or a Resy or a lounge buddy, so forth and so on. And yet, you go back 10 years, we're at the same place. 
And so we believe, when we look at it as managers of the business, we're getting tremendous operating leverage because we're able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating cost. And that's how we look at it."

So Steve, you noted in your color that for 2022, you expect T&E to be, on the consumer side, to be fully recovered and a healthy economy. So maybe first, can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending. You outlined OpEx and marketing this year could be $4.5 billion. Will there be a pullback in spending or could we see revenues accelerating as card member growth picks up? 
And then secondly, you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below pre COVID levels. We're in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pent-up demand, like myself, but can't leverage anything in the near term. So can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and how you're thinking about product refreshes? And does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of what's included in the value proposition?"
92001,698647477,2181422,"American Express Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think becaus",801,"Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think because people couldn't travel, what we tried to do was to do 2 things: to not only provide them value in the short term, but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card. And so when you look at what we did with Platinum and with Open Platinum and Centurion, by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits, we had 78% of our U.S. Platinum card members take advantage of those -- of that value injection. We had about 50% of our small business customers take advantage of that. 
But the really interesting point, in consumer Platinum, 17% of our base was not putting wireless on their card. They are now. So we had an uptick of 17%. Now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult. Recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have. And so for the first time, 17% of our Platinum card base actually put wireless on their card, which is you might think surprising, but people put spending in compartments. And 10% put streaming on the card. 
So the value injection is meant for us to do 2 things: number one, steer people where we want them to go; and number two, provide real value to them. And we did that. And I think that, that has really helped us from a retention perspective, because obviously people want value. We'll continue to do that. And then we'll look at our overall value propositions just as we've had over the course of the last 3 years and continue to refresh those. And I think you'll see those refreshed and we'll expand the aperture of that. 
So you will expand beyond traditional T&E value proposition enhancements. We'll look at other T&E value proposition enhancements because safety and traveling will become even more important, I think, to our premium cardholders. And we'll work with our partners. A lot of the value we put in is either co-funded or merchant funded, and we'll continue to work with our partners to do that. 
So we have -- we feel really good about the retention that we saw, and we feel really good about the value injection because of the behavioral shift that it drove, and we believe that, that will be sticky, which is why you see an increase in our non-T&E spending on a sequential basis. And we believe that will continue. So that's the first part. 
As far as the second part of the question, look, we do believe -- the first question was, we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pent-up demand. I just -- I see the vaccines working. We see herd immunity coming, and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter. If, God forbid, the vaccines, the efficacy proves, it doesn't work, we got a whole different issue for the entire economy, and we're not talking about American Express traveling. We're talking about different things at this particular point. But all indications are vaccine will work, it will be distributed and off we'll go. 
As far as corporate spending, look, our corporate card business, which is near and dear to all of us, drives about 9% of our overall billings and about 60% of that is T&E. There are companies that are still traveling. And the T&E piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines. It's across lodging, it's across restaurants, it's across car rental, and it's across air as well. And so we have pharmaceutical sales reps that travel by car, they stay in hotels and they spend food. That's still going on. Where you see not a lot of T&E spending is consultants who cannot go actually to their clients. But when you think about industrials and manufacturing, that is still going on. And you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts. 
But having said that, we don't anticipate that coming back, but we don't believe that's a big driver of our overall profitability. As we've said, it's not a big driver of our revenue. That 9% billings does not equate to either 9% revenue or 9% profitability. And we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our Corporate Card business."

And so as T&E comes back, that MDR will move back up, but OptBlue will not have any pressure at all in that discount rate. So we expect, as T&E moves up, overall discount rate will go up.

Because, again, we manage this industry by industry, and I can't control mix.

I mean, look, look, have we added more compliance people over the years? Yes. Do we spend more time with regulators? Yes. Could that be more? Yes, it could probably be more. But when you think about the underlying economics of our business, I really don't think it's going to impact our spend. And if you think about our model, our model is a get the card, have a fee, spend and then we have lend. We're not as dependent on lending revenues or lending profits as our competitors are, which is probably where a lot of regulation will come in if it does come in. 
So we'll just see how that all plays out. And we've been through -- I've been through many administrations since I've been at American Express, we'll do what's required, and we've moved on.

What's interesting, Bob, is that we are adding a lot of locations. Obviously, international is being a little bit more challenged than the U.S. Our international spending, our international cards tend to be a lot more T&E focused. And so they're down a little bit more. But we believe that will come back. And so we haven't run the numbers on sort of market share at this particular point. But as you know, we were certainly gaining market share in like 8 of the key markets that we participate in. And we believe, again, as that pent-up demand for travel, our attrition numbers are the same, showing the same sort of signs that they show in the United States. When we talk about attrition, we talk about global attrition, and there really is no difference between international, how international is performing versus how the U.S. is performing. So we feel good that, that will come back in both small business and consumer international were 2 of the fastest growing areas. 
As far as Kabbage goes, I think the thing that we're really excited about is Kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses. And so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan, to get a term loan, to have now a business checking account, to be able to have your card product, to do cash flow analysis on the platform, it gives us sort of an all-in-one platform to serve the needs of small businesses, which is why we did that and what we've been shooting for over the last couple of years, it was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us. And that will be -- we'll be rolling that out end of Q1 into Q2 and continuing to make enhancements on Kabbage. 
So we're really excited about it and the opportunities that it brings from a small business perspective."

In the U.K. and Europe more generally, as you would expect, Craig, you saw in December and now into January some significant declines in restaurants and other T&E. But what you continue to see stability in, though, is the non-T&E spending. So it's an interesting observation that as Europe has locked down more, it has the expected impact on restaurants and lodging, the people who were doing locally. But it doesn't have an impact on non T&E. And to go to Australia, Australia, like many of our non-U.S. markets, was heavily, heavily or more heavily than the U.S. driven by T&E. And of course, T&E, that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross-border travel, and there are also many restrictions on cross state travel within Australia. So non-T&E spending in Australia, as it does around the world, looks good. But the T&E spending, while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world, that's not where the bigger dollars are. 
The bigger dollars is in other parts of travel, and that's going to be slower to come back and is going to await a lessening of the government lockdowns."

And while we're still seeing the impact",1323,"Thanks, Vivian. Good morning, and belated Happy New Year to everyone, and hope you and your families are healthy and safe.  
As you saw, we earned $1.76 per share or $9.35 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. And while we're still seeing the impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business, the trends have steadily improved as the year went on. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had little visibility into the future. But we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty, focusing on 4 priorities: supporting our colleagues, protecting our customers and our brand, remaining financially strong, and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer-term growth.  
We've made substantial progress against each of these priorities. As I talked about last quarter, we see this cycle playing out in 3 phases. Phase 1 has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty, which is what we focused on for most of 2020. We are now solidly in Phase 2, which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum. Our goal in Phase 2 is to prepare us for Phase 3, a return to pre-COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm.  
Our progress in managing through Phase 1 confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model. Key elements of this model, such as the diversity and scale of our customer base, our brand, our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase. As we've seen throughout this period, our customers have been resilient and adaptive. Since the lows in mid-April, overall Card Member spending has steadily improved. Our card members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and card-not-present spending.  
Non-T&E spending recovered to pre-COVID levels in Q3 and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in Q4. Consumer holiday spending was up 11% globally year-over-year, exhibiting particularly strong online growth of 40%. In addition, our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers. Attrition rates in our proprietary products remain lower than last year, and our customer satisfaction levels remain above pre-COVID levels. We again ranked #1 in J.D. Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers for the 10th time in the 14 years the study has been conducted.  
Throughout the year, our merchant network continue to grow globally. We sustained virtual parity coverage in the United States and we added more than 3.7 million merchant locations internationally in 2020. Credit performance continued to be outstanding, thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities and the quick adjustments we've made as the pandemic hit.  
Our Q4 delinquencies and write-offs are at some of the lowest levels we've seen in a few years and are best-in-class. Our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period. And our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic that -- which was brought to their -- which has been brought to their lives at work and at home.  
All in all, I feel good about all that we accomplished in 2020 and some of the highlights of which you can see on Slide 2. I am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward. That being said, the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the short term. The pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed. For us, the timing of how quickly we can get to Phase 3 and return to pre-pandemic levels of earnings is also tied to a recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending, and therefore, dependent on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again.  
We continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to pre-COVID levels. We just can't predict right now how quickly. Given this environment, we are looking at 2021 as a transition year during which our focus will be on building -- rebuilding growth momentum. By rebuilding growth momentum, we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines, scaling key next horizon opportunities and retaining the flexibility in our financial model.  
To accomplish this, we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following. In our consumer and commercial businesses, we plan to continue to ramp up our Card Member acquisition activities, inject additional value into targeted products and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products. Additionally, in our commercial business, we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card. A few examples of how we're doing this include the work already underway to integrate and relaunch Kabbage's suite of products, including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our AP automation solutions, where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone.  
On the network side, we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally. We're also investing in enhancements to our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in China.  
Finally, we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses. The nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features, services and experiences we rolled out in 2020 and over the past several years, and we think these trends are here to stay.  
At a high level, those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future.  
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, let me end with a few words about how we're thinking about our financial performance in 2021 and beyond. On last quarter's earnings call, I talked about how my confidence in the long term was growing, though the near term remains harder to predict. Today, I'm even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and long term, but I'm still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in 2021.  
As I discussed, our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum. With this in mind, we will not be focused on a particular EPS target in 2021, though Jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes. In reflecting on COVID's impact on the economy and our business in 2020 and where we are as we begin 2021, we look at this 2-year period as a pause in the growth momentum we had been generating for the previous 10 consecutive quarters before the pandemic began.  
As a result, we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward. I believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration. The foundation of our business is solid, our brand, customer relationships and partnerships are strong.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how you're thinking about the future with some scenario",3037,"Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how you're thinking about the future with some scenarios, potential outcomes for 2021.  
Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Our results in the fourth quarter continue to improve sequentially, but we're still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, while card fee revenues continued to grow.  
Net income was $1.4 billion, and earnings per share was $1.76 in the fourth quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Now as I've said over the past 3 quarters, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends. So I'll again spend the most time on these 2 topics.  
Turning to the details of our volumes. First, let's start with billed business, which you will see several views of on Slides 4 through 10. The rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since September. And so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our billed business slides since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful due to the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays.  
Starting with Slide 4. Overall billed business declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our proprietary billed business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was down that same 16%, and the remaining 14% of our overall billings which comes from our network business, GNS, was down 15% in the fourth quarter, all on an FX-adjusted basis.  
When you look at our billed business performance in 2020 and think about what this might mean for 2021, it's important to think about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends, as you can see on Slide 5.  
Non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes, hit a trough in the second quarter but was back above pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as our card members, particularly consumers and SMEs, have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment.  
T&E spending, on the other hand, has remained down much more significantly, declining 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, though it did show some continued modest sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic, non-T&E spending was around 70% of our proprietary billed business. And today, it represents almost 90%, as you can see on Slide 6.  
Looking at the billings mix by customer type at the bottom of the slide, you see that the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our consumer business, and that is even more true today. 
Taking a closer look at T&E on Slide 7, you see that consumer T&E continue to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent-up demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations that corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time.  
We also continue to see different paces of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business, have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines, but both showed modest improvement sequentially in Q4. Restaurant spending, on the other hand, has been the most resilient throughout, decelerated slightly during Q4 due to colder weather in the U.S. and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies.  
Moving on to Global Consumer on Slide 8. We continue to see an acceleration in online and card-not-present spend growth throughout 2020, especially during the holiday season, which drove 5% growth in non-T&E spending in the fourth quarter.  
Turning next to our global commercial billed business on Slide 9, non-T&E spending has returned to pre-COVID levels and grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within our commercial segment, you continue to see a tale of 2 very different customer types. Spending from small and medium-sized enterprise customers who historically have the highest mix of non-T&E spending has been the most resilient throughout 2020. Whereas large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily T&E, has been down the most during the pandemic. I will remind you here that spending from our SME customers now represents 86% of our commercial billed business. 
You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions on Slide 10, which have more travel-related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern, which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic.  
To sum up on volumes, we feel good about the pace of recovery in non-T&E spending throughout 2020 and expect it will continue to grow steadily in 2021. But more broadly in 2021, our overall volume recovery to pre-pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with T&E since non-T&E has already substantially recovered. While we currently expect spending in Q1 '21 to remain relatively in line with Q4 of 2020, upside of some impact from normal seasonality, our current assumption is that by Q4 of 2021, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of Q4 2019 levels.  
Moving next to loans and receivables on Slide 11. Loan and receivable balances were up 4% and 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays. However, loan and receivable volumes were down 17% and 24% year-over-year, respectively, in the fourth quarter driven by the continued declines in spending volumes that I just spoke. We also continue to see higher pay-down rates from revolving card members on our credit cards.  
Looking forward into 2021, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes if the higher pay-down rate trends we saw in 2020 continue. In addition, I'd remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year due to seasonal spending patterns.  
Turning next to our traditional credit metrics on Slide 12, you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with Card Member loans and receivable write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 30% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. In addition, our write-off and delinquency rates continued to be down year-over-year and down sequentially in the fourth quarter, reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates we've seen in several years for both Card Member loans and receivables.  
Looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 13, those balances continue to decline sequentially to $4 billion at the end of Q4 and now stand $1.2 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. Historically, the credit outcomes of card members that are enrolled in these programs are better than delinquent card members that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience.  
It is unusual to see credit performance this strong in an environment like this. It all starts with the changes we've made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which give us a solid or gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance. Of course, like others, our customers are also helped by external factors such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. And that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves. 
Moving on to Slide 14, you will see that the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in the modeling of CECL reserves for the expected lifetime losses of the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenarios since Q3. But the 2 scenarios do remain sharply [ to aversion ].
In our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter, we continue to weight heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that I just spoke about. Despite this caution, the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release $674 million of reserves in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 15.  
This reserve release, coupled with our low write-offs, drove a provision expense benefit of $111 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $5.8 billion of reserves, representing 7.3% of our loan balances, 0.6% of our Card Member receivables balances, respectively. We believe that the reserves on our balance sheet, which are up $1.5 billion from the pre-pandemic levels, are appropriate, giving the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery.  
Turning now to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 16. Fourth quarter revenues were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, member card fees continued to grow, as you can see on Slide 17.  
Net card fee growth remains strong throughout 2020 and grew 12% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter.  
Although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll continue to increase investments in this area this year, it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate. As a result, I do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate.  
Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on Slide 18. Net interest income declined 17% on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter. Net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 10 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk, mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances.  
Looking forward, I'd expect net interest income to be relatively flat to Q4 in the first quarter and then increase modestly as loan volumes recover.  
Turning next to our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This difference drove an 11 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since, as a reminder, we, on average, earn higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. The discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter. Looking forward into 2021, I'd expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of T&E recovery. 
Coming back to total revenues on Slide 20, you see that the overall revenue trends in 2020 have broadly moved in line with billed business trends given the spend-centric nature of our business model. While I would expect first quarter 2021 revenues to be broadly in line with Q4 outside of some impact from seasonality, if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned earlier, you'll probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you would see full year revenue growth that's somewhat lower or higher than that 9% to 10%.  
Moving on to Slide 21. We're continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 24% for the full year, driven by lower spending and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a 50% offset to the full year revenue declines we saw in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, that offset was closer to 40% as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. And I would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of 2021.  
Moving on to the marketing expense line. We invested $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we could spend as much as a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this year.  
Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions.  
Turning to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 6% year-over-year in 2020 as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our long-term strategies. In 2021, we expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum.  
Last, while you saw some quarterly volatility this year in our effective tax rate, the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below 23% and I'd expect around a 23% effective tax rate in 2021, absent any legislative changes.  
Turning next to capital and liquidity on Slide 22. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have been all year. Our CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.5% after hitting in the third quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the year at $54.6 billion and has been at record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet.  
We remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. We plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum Fed authorized capacity of around $440 million in Q1.  
Beyond Q1, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. To sum up, we feel good about how we've navigated through the unprecedented challenges of 2020, and we feel well positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in 2021. We now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment. The 2 areas that do remain harder to predict for 2021, though, are the same 2 we have talked about since the pandemic began: the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in T&E spending, as I mentioned earlier.  
That said, the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in 2021. And so on Slide 23, we have outlined 2 scenarios. Most importantly, scenario 1 assumes that the caution we have shown in our Q4 credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted. Such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4, and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $5. 
Scenario 2, most importantly, assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery, leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery. The combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger EPS outcome in the area of $7.  
In either scenario, our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum, along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts, not by focusing on a specific EPS outcome. We run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the long term. Although we can't predict precisely where 2021 EPS will land or provide an EPS guidance range at this time, we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely",650,"Yes. Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year. I mean, when we were talking last year at any given point in time, we didn't have a vaccine. 
And so while the vaccine right now is, what I would call it, fits and starts, I mean, is there enough -- at the beginning, there wasn't enough places to sort of -- to do vaccine distribution. Now they have vaccine distribution points, but you don't have enough vaccine to distribute, hard to get appointments. There's -- so there's a lot of disconnect. That will sort itself out. And it will sort itself out over a period of a couple of months, not over a couple of years. And so we believe that by June or so, you will either have sort of a herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity. 
The other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pent-up demand for travel. It's probably -- and nobody on this call that doesn't want to travel or go someplace or don't know their friends or family don't want to do the same thing. And so when we look at it, I don't think you'll see a widespread international travel, but you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being domestic travel here in the United States, domestic travel sort of within the European Union, things like that. You're probably not going to see a lot of long-haul this year. 
And so look, I'm fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel. I mean, we're talking about consumer travel potentially being back about 80% with overall travel being back about 70%. Business travel will come back a little bit slower. But I'd be shocked if we're sitting here at this time next year and we say, geez, well, we really missed it on travel. I just don't see that happening. I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines. But again, these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace. 
I mean, what do you have? Like 20 million people in the United States at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that, and it's only January. And so I believe that as we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel. I think cruise lines, that's more of a 2022 phenomenon. So we feel really good about consumer travel coming back. I think our airline partner with Delta, Ed said the same thing on his earnings call. So we feel real confident about that. 
And as far as new cards, I mean, look, new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix. But what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast, not the scenarios, is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because you're not going to have those card members traveling right out of the gate, they'll probably be more of a second half phenomenon. And so their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal. 
Having said that, we are really focused on getting -- we don't talk a lot about cards, but cards lead to billed business acquired, which we do talk a lot about. We are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine, and we believe there are a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards."

I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 20",366,"Sanjay, I'll add 2 things on cards and then talk about reserves. I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 2019 levels. That's a really good sign to us. 
The other point I'd make is just to reiterate what Steve said is that it's really a 2022 impact to a great extent. 2021 is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers. It won't affect the 2021 results that much because the 2021 results, then to go to your last question, are all about what happens. It's credit. 
And I guess I'd encourage everyone to think about 2 numbers. So I cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year, we now end the year with $1.5 billion more in credit reserves. We also, relative to the beginning of the year, ended the year with $1.2 billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs. And yet I also pointed out that historically, 80% of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs, we end up collecting and doing fine with. 
So what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook. And so you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy. Small businesses going bankrupt, lots of consumers being laid off, you have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed. So we're not making an economic call, Sanjay. We're saying, well, if all that bad stuff happens, like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast, then we're going to need all those reserves we have on the books, and you're probably that's sort of where the low scenario comes from. 
Conversely, if, while rocky, there's a fairly steady recovery, we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario. So we'll have to see. But either way, our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year because it's all about 2022."

I think our Cashback cards were actually doing quite well as well. What we have not seen, and this makes all the sense in the world, is our co-brand acquisition. And our co-brand acquisition, I mean, look, the reason you do co-brand cards, you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners, but you also get tremendous distribution. And right now, not a lot of people stay in hotels, not a lot of people taking flights. So you lose the distribution opportunities. 
Having said that, what our co-brand cards, though, are performing either in the United States or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective because, as I've said all along, people spend to gather those points to take those trips because they have such a pent-up demand for travel. And our retention numbers on our co-brand cards are at the same levels they were in 2019. So we feel good about proprietary acquisition, which again, is being driven by Platinum and Gold and some Cashback. Our co-brand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our -- the co-brand channels. 
But having said that, our co-brand performance is really, really good. And Ed made that comment, Ed Bastian made that comment in his earnings remarks as well.

So on 2021, Mark, I guess the point is the overwhelming driver of a low scenario or a high scenario are what happens or is going to be what happens with credit, as I said a few minutes ago. Now sure, if credit turns out to be really strong, your revenue is going to be a little on the strong side and vice versa. But what we're trying to do, if you go throughout my remarks, is give you a very clear sense of how we're going to manage the company this year. And that's why I told you what we're going to manage OpEx to and what we might spend on marketing. And we're going to do those things because we're all about rebuilding growth momentum this year. 
The ultimate credit outcome and just how quickly discount revenues come back is going to be driven by the external environment. And that's why you have a low and a high scenario, but it really is not going to impact how we run the company this year, which of those 2 scenarios comes out. So that's what we're trying to communicate by calling these scenarios as opposed to a guidance range. And then, Steve, maybe you want to talk about..."

I don't think that's going to be a driver of it. And so if you have that as your baseline, then I think we're right within where we want to be. And the key thing that we need to do is -- and we've said this as we went through both of our remarks, our investment levels will be higher than they've ever been. That's our plan. We are planning, provided we have and we have light to -- we see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of investment opportunities, we will continue to invest and take advantage of all those investment opportunities that are available to us. If they're not there, we'll pull back. But we believe they will be there. We will look to ramp up our card acquisition. We will look at value injection early on in the year. We'll look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year. We're going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the United States. We're going to drive really hard at international acceptance. 
I mean, look, we signed 3.7 million merchants internationally last year, not including China. Take China off the table for a second, but we're going to drive international acceptance, as we've said. We're going to continue to work and invest in our network. We're going to launch Kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers. And we're going to get some traction in China as well. So we are really focused in 2021 in investing across all dimensions of our -- each one of our business lines and preparing ourselves for 2022 by building that strong foundation of retaining card members, acquiring new ones and building that merchant network and continuing to build up network capabilities and digital capabilities. We believe with the healthy economy and T&E consumer spending just about fully recovered, we'll be within our range."

I mean what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company, which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing. And we have a very clear plan in 2021 to manage those to about $11.5 billion. That is below 2019 levels. If you were to look at some businesses we've sold over the years, it's frankly about where the number was a decade ago, in 2012 and 2013. 
So I think -- we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what I think of as the infrastructure cost of the company, which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow, there's tremendous leverage from holding that a little below 2019 level. There's always a little bit of quarterly noise, particularly the Q4, some of the lines in OpEx you'll see every year, if you go back and look at history, go up a little bit. But that's the disciplined approach that we're taking here. So I don't know if I got to the number of your question, Rick, but that's probably how we think about it."

The other thing I would add is that if you look at this number on the face of it, it's pretty much the same number we've had in 2012 from an operating expense perspective. But yet, the business is very different than it was in 2012. We're focused on different things. We've acquired a bunch of companies, which are in here. And our focus has been completely different. So I think the team has done a really good job of, on an ongoing basis, taking expense out and then putting in investment back in. And so as you think about this, what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base. And the way we look at it, that's providing us leverage. So if we think about the core business that we had, we're getting enough leverage out that to fund other opportunities within the business, whether that be Kabbage, whether that be the acquisition of a Mezi or a Resy or a lounge buddy, so forth and so on. And yet, you go back 10 years, we're at the same place. And so we believe, when we look at it as managers of the business, we're getting tremendous operating leverage because we're able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating cost and that's how we look at it."

So Steve, you noted in your color that for 2022, you expect T&E to be, on the consumer side, to be fully recovered and a healthy economy. So maybe first, can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending? You outlined OpEx and marketing this year could be $4.5 billion. Will there be a pullback in spending? Or could we see revenues accelerating as card member growth picks up? 
And then secondly, you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below pre-COVID levels. We're in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pent-up demand, like myself, but can't leverage anything in the near term. So can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and how you're thinking about product refreshes? And does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of what's included in the value proposition?"
92001,698647477,2181531,"American Express Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think becaus",801,"Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think because people couldn't travel, what we tried to do was to do 2 things: to not only provide them value in the short term, but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card. And so when you look at what we did with Platinum and with OPEN Platinum and Centurion, by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits, we had 78% of our U.S. Platinum card members take advantage of those -- of that value injection. We had about 50% of our small business customers take advantage of that. 
But the really interesting point, in consumer Platinum, 17% of our base was not putting wireless on their card. They are now. So we had an uptick of 17%. Now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult. Recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have. And so for the first time, 17% of our Platinum card base actually put wireless on a card, which is you might think surprising, but people put spending in compartments, and 10% put streaming on the card. 
So the value injection is meant for us to do 2 things: number one, steer people where we want them to go; and number two, provide real value to them. And we did that. And I think that, that has really helped us from a retention perspective because, obviously, people want value. We'll continue to do that. And then we'll look at our overall value propositions just as we've had over the course of the last 3 years and continue to refresh those. And I think you'll see those refreshed and we'll expand the aperture of that. 
So you will expand beyond traditional T&E value proposition enhancements. We'll look at other T&E value proposition enhancements because safety in traveling will become even more important, I think, to our premium cardholders. And we'll work with our partners. A lot of the value we put in is either co-funded or merchant funded, and we'll continue to work with our partners to do that. 
So we have -- we feel really good about the retention that we saw, and we feel really good about the value injection because of the behavioral shift that it drove, and we believe that, that will be sticky, which is why you see an increase in our non-T&E spending on a sequential basis, and we believe that will continue. So that's the first part. 
As far as the second part of the question, look, we do believe -- the first question was, we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pent-up demand. I just -- I see the vaccines working. We see herd immunity coming, and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter. If, God forbid, the vaccines, the efficacy proves it doesn't work, we got a whole different issue for the entire economy, and we're not talking about American Express traveling. We're talking about different things at this particular point. But all indications are vaccine will work, it will be distributed and off we'll go. 
As far as corporate spending, look, our corporate card business, which is near and dear to all of us, drives about 9% of our overall billings and about 60% of that is T&E. There are companies that are still traveling. And the T&E piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines. It's across lodging, it's across restaurants, it's across car rental, and it's across air as well. And so we have pharmaceutical sales reps that travel by car, they stay in hotels and they spend food. That's still going on. Where you see not a lot of T&E spending is consultants who cannot go actually to their clients. But when you think about industrials and manufacturing, that is still going on. And you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts. 
But having said that, we don't anticipate that coming back, but we don't believe that's a big driver of our overall profitability. As we've said, it's not a big driver of our revenue. That 9% billings does not equate to either 9% revenue or 9% profitability. And we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our corporate card business."

And obviously, if you look at what's happened at discount rate, discount rate has been driven down by mix. And it's like I've always said, I always focus on discount rate by industry and mix overall because if you look at sort of where we are right now, at 2.25% or -- I think that's where we are right now, is 2.25%, is ""Oh my God, you're at 2.25%."" But you're at 2.25% with 65% T&E decline. 
And so as T&E comes back, that MDR will move back up, but OptBlue will not have any pressure at all in that discount rate. So we expect, as T&E moves up, overall discount rate will go up. But having said that, if T&E -- if non-T&E winds up going through the roof, and that puts pressure on MDR, that's fine. We're okay with that. Because, again, we manage this industry by industry, and I can't control mix. But if, in fact, our non-T&E, which is -- has a lower MDR on average than T&E, if that continues to grow and grow, I think everybody would be happy with that."

And look, we'll comply. We will comply, and we will do what we need to do. And I don't think it's going to be a major deterrent to us running our business in any way. 
I mean, look, have we added more compliance people over the years? Yes. Do we spend more time with regulators? Yes. Will -- could that be more? Yes, it could probably be more. But when you think about the underlying economics of our business, I really don't think it's going to impact our spend.

And we believe, again, that there's that pent-up demand for travel, our attrition numbers are the same, showing the same sort of signs that they show in the United States. When we talk about attrition, we talk about global attrition, and there really is no difference between international, how international is performing versus how the U.S. is performing. So we feel good that, that will come back and both small business and consumer international were 2 of the fastest growing areas. 
As far as Kabbage goes, I think the thing that we're really excited about is Kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses. And so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan, to get a term loan, to have now a business checking account, to be able to have your card product, to do cash flow analysis on the platform, it gives us sort of an all-in-one platform to serve the needs of small businesses, which is why we did that and what we've been shooting for over the last couple of years, it was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us. And that will be -- we'll be rolling that out end of Q1 into Q2 and continuing to make enhancements on Kabbage.
So we're really excited about it and the opportunities that it brings from a small business perspective."

So I do think it's just important to understand, we compete on many, many fronts. And while the consumer business is a large piece of it and probably the most highly competitive, and it has been for probably 10 years. 
Look, we anticipate that not only JPMorgan, but Bank of America, Citi, Capital, everybody is going to be out there looking to get card members to bring more into the fold and to drive top line revenue. So I don't think there's been a step down in competition. I think you will see a -- I think Jamie said on his call, he's stepping up his investments. And I think just pretty much every CEO would say the same thing. So we anticipate that it's going to be just as competitive as it's been as we have seen over the last few years. 
And look, we're -- we look forward to it, and we look forward to competing. And we believe our value propositions will continue to stand up well to our competitors. Look, I don't know about their acquisition and what it is that they're trying to achieve. They got a lot of smart people over at JPMorgan. And I think they do a really great job running their business, and we've got a lot of respect for them. And so I'm sure they'll figure out how to integrate this into their value propositions to compete in the most effective way that they deem is the right way to go about it. And we'll continue to do what we do, and we feel good about the hand that we hold and off we'll go, and we'll see what happens. 
But I think for more color on that, I would ask Jamie and Gordon."

In the U.K. and Europe more generally, as you would expect, Craig, you saw in December and now into January some significant declines in restaurants and other T&E. But what you continue to see stability in, though, is the non-T&E spending. So it's an interesting observation that as Europe has locked down more, it has the expected impact on restaurants and lodging, the people who were doing locally. But it doesn't have an impact on non-T&E. And to go to Australia, Australia, like many of our non-U.S. markets, was heavily, heavily -- or more heavily than the U.S. driven by T&E. And of course, T&E, that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross-border travel, and there are also many restrictions on cross-state travel within Australia. So non-T&E spending in Australia, as it does around the world, looks good. But the T&E spending, while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world, that's not where the bigger dollars are. 
The bigger dollars is on -- are in other parts of travel, and that's going to be slower to come back and is going to await a lessening of the government lockdowns."

As you saw, we earned $1.76 per share or $9.35 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. And while we're still seeing the impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business, the trends have steadily improved as the year went on. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had little visibility into the future. But we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty, focusing on 4 priorities: supporting our colleagues, protecting our customers and our brand, remaining financially strong, and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer-term growth.  
We've made substantial progress against each of these priorities. As I talked about last quarter, we see this cycle playing out in 3 phases. Phase 1 has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty, which is what we focused on for most of 2020. We are now solidly in Phase 2, which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum. Our goal in Phase 2 is to prepare us for Phase 3, a return to pre-COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm.  
Our progress in managing through Phase 1 confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model. Key elements of this model, such as the diversity and scale of our customer base, our brand, our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase. As we've seen throughout this period, our customers have been resilient and adaptive. Since the lows in mid-April, overall Card Member spending has steadily improved. Our card members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and card-not-present spending.  
Non-T&E spending recovered to pre-COVID levels in Q3 and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in Q4. Consumer holiday spending was up 11% globally year-over-year, exhibiting particularly strong online growth of 40%. In addition, our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers. Attrition rates in our proprietary products remain lower than last year, and our customer satisfaction levels remain above pre-COVID levels. We again ranked #1 in J.D. Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers for the 10th time in the 14 years the study has been conducted.  
Throughout the year, our merchant network continue to grow globally. We sustained virtual parity coverage in the United States and we added more than 3.7 million merchant locations internationally in 2020. Credit performance continued to be outstanding, thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities and the quick adjustments we've made as the pandemic hit.  
Our Q4 delinquencies and write-offs are at some of the lowest levels we've seen in a few years and are best-in-class. Our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period. And our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic that -- which was brought to their -- which has been brought to their lives at work and at home.  
All in all, I feel good about all that we accomplished in 2020 and some of the highlights of which you can see on Slide 2. I am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward. That being said, the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the short term. The pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed. For us, the timing of how quickly we can get to Phase 3 and return to pre-pandemic levels of earnings is also tied to a recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending, and therefore, dependent on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again.  
We continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to pre-COVID levels. We just can't predict right now how quickly. Given this environment, we are looking at 2021 as a transition year during which our focus will be on building -- rebuilding growth momentum. By rebuilding growth momentum, we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines, scaling key next horizon opportunities and retaining the flexibility in our financial model.  
To accomplish this, we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following. In our consumer and commercial businesses, we plan to continue to ramp up our Card Member acquisition activities, inject additional value into targeted products and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products. Additionally, in our commercial business, we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card. A few examples of how we're doing this include the work already underway to integrate and relaunch Kabbage's suite of products, including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our AP automation solutions, where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone.  
On the network side, we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally. We're also investing in enhancements to our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in China.  
Finally, we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses. The nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features, services and experiences we rolled out in 2020 and over the past several years, and we think these trends are here to stay.  
At a high level, those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future.  
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, let me end with a few words about how we're thinking about our financial performance in 2021 and beyond. On last quarter's earnings call, I talked about how my confidence in the long term was growing, though the near term remains harder to predict. Today, I'm even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and long term, but I'm still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in 2021.  
As I discussed, our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum. With this in mind, we will not be focused on a particular EPS target in 2021, though Jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes. In reflecting on COVID's impact on the economy and our business in 2020 and where we are as we begin 2021, we look at this 2-year period as a pause in the growth momentum we had been generating for the previous 10 consecutive quarters before the pandemic began.  
As a result, we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward. I believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration. The foundation of our business is solid, our brand, customer relationships and partnerships are strong. Our colleagues are focused and committed, and we have shown that we can adapt to rapidly changing conditions. 
I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions after that. Thank you for your time."

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how you're thinking about the future with some scenarios, potential outcomes for 2021.  
Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Our results in the fourth quarter continue to improve sequentially, but we're still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, while card fee revenues continued to grow.  
Net income was $1.4 billion, and earnings per share was $1.76 in the fourth quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Now as I've said over the past 3 quarters, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends. So I'll again spend the most time on these 2 topics.  
Turning to the details of our volumes. First, let's start with billed business, which you will see several views of on Slides 4 through 10. The rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since September. And so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our billed business slides since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful due to the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays.  
Starting with Slide 4. Overall billed business declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our proprietary billed business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was down that same 16%, and the remaining 14% of our overall billings which comes from our network business, GNS, was down 15% in the fourth quarter, all on an FX-adjusted basis.  
When you look at our billed business performance in 2020 and think about what this might mean for 2021, it's important to think about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends, as you can see on Slide 5.  
Non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes, hit a trough in the second quarter but was back above pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as our card members, particularly consumers and SMEs, have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment.  
T&E spending, on the other hand, has remained down much more significantly, declining 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, though it did show some continued modest sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic, non-T&E spending was around 70% of our proprietary billed business. And today, it represents almost 90%, as you can see on Slide 6.  
Looking at the billings mix by customer type at the bottom of the slide, you see that the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our consumer business, and that is even more true today. 
Taking a closer look at T&E on Slide 7, you see that consumer T&E continue to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent-up demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations that corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time.  
We also continue to see different paces of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business, have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines, but both showed modest improvement sequentially in Q4. Restaurant spending, on the other hand, has been the most resilient throughout, decelerated slightly during Q4 due to colder weather in the U.S. and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies.  
Moving on to Global Consumer on Slide 8. We continue to see an acceleration in online and card-not-present spend growth throughout 2020, especially during the holiday season, which drove 5% growth in non-T&E spending in the fourth quarter.  
Turning next to our global commercial billed business on Slide 9, non-T&E spending has returned to pre-COVID levels and grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within our commercial segment, you continue to see a tale of 2 very different customer types. Spending from small and medium-sized enterprise customers who historically have the highest mix of non-T&E spending has been the most resilient throughout 2020. Whereas large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily T&E, has been down the most during the pandemic. I will remind you here that spending from our SME customers now represents 86% of our commercial billed business. 
You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions on Slide 10, which have more travel-related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern, which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic.  
To sum up on volumes, we feel good about the pace of recovery in non-T&E spending throughout 2020 and expect it will continue to grow steadily in 2021. But more broadly in 2021, our overall volume recovery to pre-pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with T&E since non-T&E has already substantially recovered. While we currently expect spending in Q1 '21 to remain relatively in line with Q4 of 2020, upside of some impact from normal seasonality, our current assumption is that by Q4 of 2021, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of Q4 2019 levels.  
Moving next to loans and receivables on Slide 11. Loan and receivable balances were up 4% and 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays. However, loan and receivable volumes were down 17% and 24% year-over-year, respectively, in the fourth quarter driven by the continued declines in spending volumes that I just spoke. We also continue to see higher pay-down rates from revolving card members on our credit cards.  
Looking forward into 2021, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes if the higher pay-down rate trends we saw in 2020 continue. In addition, I'd remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year due to seasonal spending patterns.  
Turning next to our traditional credit metrics on Slide 12, you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with Card Member loans and receivable write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 30% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. In addition, our write-off and delinquency rates continued to be down year-over-year and down sequentially in the fourth quarter, reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates we've seen in several years for both Card Member loans and receivables.  
Looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 13, those balances continue to decline sequentially to $4 billion at the end of Q4 and now stand $1.2 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. Historically, the credit outcomes of card members that are enrolled in these programs are better than delinquent card members that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience.  
It is unusual to see credit performance this strong in an environment like this. It all starts with the changes we've made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which give us a solid or gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance. Of course, like others, our customers are also helped by external factors such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. And that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves. 
Moving on to Slide 14, you will see that the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in the modeling of CECL reserves for the expected lifetime losses of the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenarios since Q3. But the 2 scenarios do remain sharply [ to aversion ].
In our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter, we continue to weight heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that I just spoke about. Despite this caution, the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release $674 million of reserves in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 15.  
This reserve release, coupled with our low write-offs, drove a provision expense benefit of $111 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $5.8 billion of reserves, representing 7.3% of our loan balances, 0.6% of our Card Member receivables balances, respectively. We believe that the reserves on our balance sheet, which are up $1.5 billion from the pre-pandemic levels, are appropriate, giving the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery.  
Turning now to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 16. Fourth quarter revenues were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, member card fees continued to grow, as you can see on Slide 17.  
Net card fee growth remains strong throughout 2020 and grew 12% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter.  
Although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll continue to increase investments in this area this year, it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate. As a result, I do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate.  
Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on Slide 18. Net interest income declined 17% on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter. Net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 10 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk, mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances.  
Looking forward, I'd expect net interest income to be relatively flat to Q4 in the first quarter and then increase modestly as loan volumes recover.  
Turning next to our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This difference drove an 11 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since, as a reminder, we, on average, earn higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. The discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter. Looking forward into 2021, I'd expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of T&E recovery. 
Coming back to total revenues on Slide 20, you see that the overall revenue trends in 2020 have broadly moved in line with billed business trends given the spend-centric nature of our business model. While I would expect first quarter 2021 revenues to be broadly in line with Q4 outside of some impact from seasonality, if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned earlier, you'll probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you would see full year revenue growth that's somewhat lower or higher than that 9% to 10%.  
Moving on to Slide 21. We're continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 24% for the full year, driven by lower spending and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a 50% offset to the full year revenue declines we saw in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, that offset was closer to 40% as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. And I would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of 2021.  
Moving on to the marketing expense line. We invested $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we could spend as much as a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this year.  
Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions.  
Turning to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 6% year-over-year in 2020 as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our long-term strategies. In 2021, we expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum.  
Last, while you saw some quarterly volatility this year in our effective tax rate, the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below 23% and I'd expect around a 23% effective tax rate in 2021, absent any legislative changes.  
Turning next to capital and liquidity on Slide 22. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have been all year. Our CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.5% after hitting in the third quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the year at $54.6 billion and has been at record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet.  
We remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. We plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum Fed authorized capacity of around $440 million in Q1.  
Beyond Q1, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. To sum up, we feel good about how we've navigated through the unprecedented challenges of 2020, and we feel well positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in 2021. We now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment. The 2 areas that do remain harder to predict for 2021, though, are the same 2 we have talked about since the pandemic began: the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in T&E spending, as I mentioned earlier.  
That said, the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in 2021. And so on Slide 23, we have outlined 2 scenarios. Most importantly, scenario 1 assumes that the caution we have shown in our Q4 credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted. Such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4, and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $5. 
Scenario 2, most importantly, assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery, leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery. The combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger EPS outcome in the area of $7.  
In either scenario, our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum, along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts, not by focusing on a specific EPS outcome. We run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the long term. Although we can't predict precisely where 2021 EPS will land or provide an EPS guidance range at this time, we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely",650,"Yes. Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year. I mean, when we were talking last year at any given point in time, we didn't have a vaccine. 
And so while the vaccine right now is, what I would call it, fits and starts, I mean, is there enough -- at the beginning, there wasn't enough places to sort of -- to do vaccine distribution. Now they have vaccine distribution points, but you don't have enough vaccine to distribute, hard to get appointments. There's -- so there's a lot of disconnect. That will sort itself out. And it will sort itself out over a period of a couple of months, not over a couple of years. And so we believe that by June or so, you will either have sort of a herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity. 
The other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pent-up demand for travel. It's probably -- and nobody on this call that doesn't want to travel or go someplace or don't know their friends or family don't want to do the same thing. And so when we look at it, I don't think you'll see a widespread international travel, but you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being domestic travel here in the United States, domestic travel sort of within the European Union, things like that. You're probably not going to see a lot of long-haul this year. 
And so look, I'm fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel. I mean, we're talking about consumer travel potentially being back about 80% with overall travel being back about 70%. Business travel will come back a little bit slower. But I'd be shocked if we're sitting here at this time next year and we say, geez, well, we really missed it on travel. I just don't see that happening. I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines. But again, these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace. 
I mean, what do you have? Like 20 million people in the United States at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that, and it's only January. And so I believe that as we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel. I think cruise lines, that's more of a 2022 phenomenon. So we feel really good about consumer travel coming back. I think our airline partner with Delta, Ed said the same thing on his earnings call. So we feel real confident about that. 
And as far as new cards, I mean, look, new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix. But what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast, not the scenarios, is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because you're not going to have those card members traveling right out of the gate, they'll probably be more of a second half phenomenon. And so their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal. 
Having said that, we are really focused on getting -- we don't talk a lot about cards, but cards lead to billed business acquired, which we do talk a lot about. We are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine, and we believe there are a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards."

We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 20",366,"Sanjay, I'll add 2 things on cards and then talk about reserves. I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 2019 levels. That's a really good sign to us. 
The other point I'd make is just to reiterate what Steve said is that it's really a 2022 impact to a great extent. 2021 is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers. It won't affect the 2021 results that much because the 2021 results, then to go to your last question, are all about what happens. It's credit. 
And I guess I'd encourage everyone to think about 2 numbers. So I cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year, we now end the year with $1.5 billion more in credit reserves. We also, relative to the beginning of the year, ended the year with $1.2 billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs. And yet I also pointed out that historically, 80% of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs, we end up collecting and doing fine with. 
So what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook. And so you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy. Small businesses going bankrupt, lots of consumers being laid off, you have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed. So we're not making an economic call, Sanjay. We're saying, well, if all that bad stuff happens, like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast, then we're going to need all those reserves we have on the books, and you're probably that's sort of where the low scenario comes from. 
Conversely, if, while rocky, there's a fairly steady recovery, we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario. So we'll have to see. But either way, our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year because it's all about 2022."

I mean, when we look at new card acquisition, our Platinum and our Gold levels were at levels of 2019, and so we feel really good about that. I think our Cashback cards were actually doing quite well as well. What we have not seen, and this makes all the sense in the world, is our co-brand acquisition. And our co-brand acquisition, I mean, look, the reason you do co-brand cards, you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners, but you also get tremendous distribution. And right now, not a lot of people stay in hotels, not a lot of people taking flights. So you lose the distribution opportunities. 
Having said that, what our co-brand cards, though, are performing either in the United States or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective because, as I've said all along, people spend to gather those points to take those trips because they have such a pent-up demand for travel. And our retention numbers on our co-brand cards are at the same levels they were in 2019. So we feel good about proprietary acquisition, which again, is being driven by Platinum and Gold and some Cashback. Our co-brand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our -- the co-brand channels. 
But having said that, our co-brand performance is really, really good. And Ed made that comment, Ed Bastian made that comment in his earnings remarks as well.

If they're not there, we'll pull back. But we believe they will be there. We will look to ramp up our card acquisition. We will look at value injection early on in the year. We'll look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year. We're going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the United States. We're going to drive really hard at international acceptance. 
I mean, look, we signed 3.7 million merchants internationally last year, not including China. Take China off the table for a second, but we're going to drive international acceptance, as we've said. We're going to continue to work and invest in our network. We're going to launch Kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers.

I mean what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company, which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing.

If you were to look at some businesses we've sold over the years, it's frankly about where the number was a decade ago, in 2012 and 2013. 
So I think -- we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what I think of as the infrastructure cost of the company, which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow, there's tremendous leverage from holding that a little below 2019 level. There's always a little bit of quarterly noise, particularly the Q4, some of the lines in OpEx you'll see every year, if you go back and look at history, go up a little bit.

So I think the team has done a really good job of, on an ongoing basis, taking expense out and then putting in investment back in. And so as you think about this, what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base. And the way we look at it, that's providing us leverage. So if we think about the core business that we had, we're getting enough leverage out that to fund other opportunities within the business, whether that be Kabbage, whether that be the acquisition of a Mezi or a Resy or a lounge buddy, so forth and so on. And yet, you go back 10 years, we're at the same place. And so we believe, when we look at it as managers of the business, we're getting tremendous operating leverage because we're able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating cost and that's how we look at it."

So Steve, you noted in your color that for 2022, you expect T&E to be, on the consumer side, to be fully recovered and a healthy economy. So maybe first, can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending? You outlined OpEx and marketing this year could be $4.5 billion. Will there be a pullback in spending? Or could we see revenues accelerating as card member growth picks up? 
And then secondly, you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below pre-COVID levels. We're in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pent-up demand, like myself, but can't leverage anything in the near term. So can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and how you're thinking about product refreshes? And does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of what's included in the value proposition?"
92001,698647477,2251224,"American Express Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think becaus",801,"Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think because people couldn't travel, what we tried to do was to do 2 things: to not only provide them value in the short term, but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card. And so when you look at what we did with Platinum and with OPEN Platinum and Centurion, by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits, we had 78% of our U.S. Platinum card members take advantage of those -- of that value injection. We had about 50% of our small business customers take advantage of that. 
But the really interesting point, in consumer Platinum, 17% of our base was not putting wireless on their card. They are now. So we had an uptick of 17%. Now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult. Recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have. And so for the first time, 17% of our Platinum card base actually put wireless on a card, which is you might think surprising, but people put spending in compartments, and 10% put streaming on the card. 
So the value injection is meant for us to do 2 things: number one, steer people where we want them to go; and number two, provide real value to them. And we did that. And I think that, that has really helped us from a retention perspective because, obviously, people want value. We'll continue to do that. And then we'll look at our overall value propositions just as we've had over the course of the last 3 years and continue to refresh those. And I think you'll see those refreshed and we'll expand the aperture of that. 
So you will expand beyond traditional T&E value proposition enhancements. We'll look at other T&E value proposition enhancements because safety in traveling will become even more important, I think, to our premium cardholders. And we'll work with our partners. A lot of the value we put in is either co-funded or merchant funded, and we'll continue to work with our partners to do that. 
So we have -- we feel really good about the retention that we saw, and we feel really good about the value injection because of the behavioral shift that it drove, and we believe that, that will be sticky, which is why you see an increase in our non-T&E spending on a sequential basis, and we believe that will continue. So that's the first part. 
As far as the second part of the question, look, we do believe -- the first question was, we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pent-up demand. I just -- I see the vaccines working. We see herd immunity coming, and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter. If, God forbid, the vaccines, the efficacy proves it doesn't work, we got a whole different issue for the entire economy, and we're not talking about American Express traveling. We're talking about different things at this particular point. But all indications are vaccine will work, it will be distributed and off we'll go. 
As far as corporate spending, look, our corporate card business, which is near and dear to all of us, drives about 9% of our overall billings and about 60% of that is T&E. There are companies that are still traveling. And the T&E piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines. It's across lodging, it's across restaurants, it's across car rental, and it's across air as well. And so we have pharmaceutical sales reps that travel by car, they stay in hotels and they spend food. That's still going on. Where you see not a lot of T&E spending is consultants who cannot go actually to their clients. But when you think about industrials and manufacturing, that is still going on. And you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts. 
But having said that, we don't anticipate that coming back, but we don't believe that's a big driver of our overall profitability. As we've said, it's not a big driver of our revenue. That 9% billings does not equate to either 9% revenue or 9% profitability. And we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our corporate card business."

And it's like I've always said, I always focus on discount rate by industry and mix overall because if you look at sort of where we are right now, at 2.25% or -- I think that's where we are right now, is 2.25%, is ""Oh my God, you're at 2.25%."" But you're at 2.25% with 65% T&E decline. 
And so as T&E comes back, that MDR will move back up, but OptBlue will not have any pressure at all in that discount rate. So we expect, as T&E moves up, overall discount rate will go up. But having said that, if T&E -- if non-T&E winds up going through the roof, and that puts pressure on MDR, that's fine. We're okay with that. Because, again, we manage this industry by industry, and I can't control mix. But if, in fact, our non-T&E, which is -- has a lower MDR on average than T&E, if that continues to grow and grow, I think everybody would be happy with that."

You don't know if that's going to be done on debt collection, you don't know where that will be. But look, we've been around 170 years, through lots and lots of administrations. We started this sort of regulatory journey, I guess, over the last -- really, really focused on our industry over the last 15 years or so. And it all started, I think, with UDAP. And look, we'll comply. We will comply, and we will do what we need to do. And I don't think it's going to be a major deterrent to us running our business in any way. 
I mean, look, have we added more compliance people over the years? Yes. Do we spend more time with regulators? Yes. Will -- could that be more? Yes, it could probably be more. But when you think about the underlying economics of our business, I really don't think it's going to impact our spend. And if you think about our model, our model is a get the card, have a fee, spend and then we have lend. We're not as dependent on lending revenues or lending profits as our competitors are, which is probably where a lot of regulation will come in, if it does come in. 
So we'll just see how that all plays out. And we've been through -- I've been through many administrations since I've been at American Express. We'll do what's required, and we've moved on.

As far as Kabbage goes, I think the thing that we're really excited about is Kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses. And so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan, to get a term loan, to have now a business checking account, to be able to have your card product, to do cash flow analysis on the platform, it gives us sort of an all-in-one platform to serve the needs of small businesses, which is why we did that and what we've been shooting for over the last couple of years, it was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us.

And of course, T&E, that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross-border travel, and there are also many restrictions on cross-state travel within Australia. So non-T&E spending in Australia, as it does around the world, looks good. But the T&E spending, while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world, that's not where the bigger dollars are. 
The bigger dollars is on -- are in other parts of travel, and that's going to be slower to come back and is going to await a lessening of the government lockdowns."

And while we're still seeing the impact",1323,"Thanks, Vivian. Good morning, and belated Happy New Year to everyone, and hope you and your families are healthy and safe.  
As you saw, we earned $1.76 per share or $9.35 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. And while we're still seeing the impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business, the trends have steadily improved as the year went on. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had little visibility into the future. But we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty, focusing on 4 priorities: supporting our colleagues, protecting our customers and our brand, remaining financially strong, and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer-term growth.  
We've made substantial progress against each of these priorities. As I talked about last quarter, we see this cycle playing out in 3 phases. Phase 1 has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty, which is what we focused on for most of 2020. We are now solidly in Phase 2, which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum. Our goal in Phase 2 is to prepare us for Phase 3, a return to pre-COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm.  
Our progress in managing through Phase 1 confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model. Key elements of this model, such as the diversity and scale of our customer base, our brand, our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase. As we've seen throughout this period, our customers have been resilient and adaptive. Since the lows in mid-April, overall Card Member spending has steadily improved. Our card members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and card-not-present spending.  
Non-T&E spending recovered to pre-COVID levels in Q3 and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in Q4. Consumer holiday spending was up 11% globally year-over-year, exhibiting particularly strong online growth of 40%. In addition, our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers. Attrition rates in our proprietary products remain lower than last year, and our customer satisfaction levels remain above pre-COVID levels. We again ranked #1 in J.D. Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers for the 10th time in the 14 years the study has been conducted.  
Throughout the year, our merchant network continue to grow globally. We sustained virtual parity coverage in the United States and we added more than 3.7 million merchant locations internationally in 2020. Credit performance continued to be outstanding, thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities and the quick adjustments we've made as the pandemic hit.  
Our Q4 delinquencies and write-offs are at some of the lowest levels we've seen in a few years and are best-in-class. Our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period. And our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic that -- which was brought to their -- which has been brought to their lives at work and at home.  
All in all, I feel good about all that we accomplished in 2020 and some of the highlights of which you can see on Slide 2. I am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward. That being said, the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the short term. The pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed. For us, the timing of how quickly we can get to Phase 3 and return to pre-pandemic levels of earnings is also tied to a recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending, and therefore, dependent on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again.  
We continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to pre-COVID levels. We just can't predict right now how quickly. Given this environment, we are looking at 2021 as a transition year during which our focus will be on building -- rebuilding growth momentum. By rebuilding growth momentum, we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines, scaling key next horizon opportunities and retaining the flexibility in our financial model.  
To accomplish this, we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following. In our consumer and commercial businesses, we plan to continue to ramp up our Card Member acquisition activities, inject additional value into targeted products and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products. Additionally, in our commercial business, we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card. A few examples of how we're doing this include the work already underway to integrate and relaunch Kabbage's suite of products, including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our AP automation solutions, where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone.  
On the network side, we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally. We're also investing in enhancements to our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in China.  
Finally, we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses. The nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features, services and experiences we rolled out in 2020 and over the past several years, and we think these trends are here to stay.  
At a high level, those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future.  
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, let me end with a few words about how we're thinking about our financial performance in 2021 and beyond. On last quarter's earnings call, I talked about how my confidence in the long term was growing, though the near term remains harder to predict. Today, I'm even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and long term, but I'm still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in 2021.  
As I discussed, our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum. With this in mind, we will not be focused on a particular EPS target in 2021, though Jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes. In reflecting on COVID's impact on the economy and our business in 2020 and where we are as we begin 2021, we look at this 2-year period as a pause in the growth momentum we had been generating for the previous 10 consecutive quarters before the pandemic began.  
As a result, we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward. I believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration. The foundation of our business is solid, our brand, customer relationships and partnerships are strong. Our colleagues are focused and committed, and we have shown that we can adapt to rapidly changing conditions. 
I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions after that. Thank you for your time."

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how you're thinking about the future with some scenarios, potential outcomes for 2021.  
Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Our results in the fourth quarter continue to improve sequentially, but we're still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, while card fee revenues continued to grow.  
Net income was $1.4 billion, and earnings per share was $1.76 in the fourth quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Now as I've said over the past 3 quarters, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends. So I'll again spend the most time on these 2 topics.  
Turning to the details of our volumes. First, let's start with billed business, which you will see several views of on Slides 4 through 10. The rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since September. And so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our billed business slides since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful due to the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays.  
Starting with Slide 4. Overall billed business declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our proprietary billed business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was down that same 16%, and the remaining 14% of our overall billings which comes from our network business, GNS, was down 15% in the fourth quarter, all on an FX-adjusted basis.  
When you look at our billed business performance in 2020 and think about what this might mean for 2021, it's important to think about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends, as you can see on Slide 5.  
Non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes, hit a trough in the second quarter but was back above pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as our card members, particularly consumers and SMEs, have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment.  
T&E spending, on the other hand, has remained down much more significantly, declining 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, though it did show some continued modest sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic, non-T&E spending was around 70% of our proprietary billed business. And today, it represents almost 90%, as you can see on Slide 6.  
Looking at the billings mix by customer type at the bottom of the slide, you see that the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our consumer business, and that is even more true today. 
Taking a closer look at T&E on Slide 7, you see that consumer T&E continue to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent-up demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations that corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time.  
We also continue to see different paces of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business, have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines, but both showed modest improvement sequentially in Q4. Restaurant spending, on the other hand, has been the most resilient throughout, decelerated slightly during Q4 due to colder weather in the U.S. and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies.  
Moving on to Global Consumer on Slide 8. We continue to see an acceleration in online and card-not-present spend growth throughout 2020, especially during the holiday season, which drove 5% growth in non-T&E spending in the fourth quarter.  
Turning next to our global commercial billed business on Slide 9, non-T&E spending has returned to pre-COVID levels and grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within our commercial segment, you continue to see a tale of 2 very different customer types. Spending from small and medium-sized enterprise customers who historically have the highest mix of non-T&E spending has been the most resilient throughout 2020. Whereas large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily T&E, has been down the most during the pandemic. I will remind you here that spending from our SME customers now represents 86% of our commercial billed business. 
You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions on Slide 10, which have more travel-related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern, which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic.  
To sum up on volumes, we feel good about the pace of recovery in non-T&E spending throughout 2020 and expect it will continue to grow steadily in 2021. But more broadly in 2021, our overall volume recovery to pre-pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with T&E since non-T&E has already substantially recovered. While we currently expect spending in Q1 '21 to remain relatively in line with Q4 of 2020, upside of some impact from normal seasonality, our current assumption is that by Q4 of 2021, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of Q4 2019 levels.  
Moving next to loans and receivables on Slide 11. Loan and receivable balances were up 4% and 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays. However, loan and receivable volumes were down 17% and 24% year-over-year, respectively, in the fourth quarter driven by the continued declines in spending volumes that I just spoke. We also continue to see higher pay-down rates from revolving card members on our credit cards.  
Looking forward into 2021, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes if the higher pay-down rate trends we saw in 2020 continue. In addition, I'd remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year due to seasonal spending patterns.  
Turning next to our traditional credit metrics on Slide 12, you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with Card Member loans and receivable write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 30% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. In addition, our write-off and delinquency rates continued to be down year-over-year and down sequentially in the fourth quarter, reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates we've seen in several years for both Card Member loans and receivables.  
Looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 13, those balances continue to decline sequentially to $4 billion at the end of Q4 and now stand $1.2 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. Historically, the credit outcomes of card members that are enrolled in these programs are better than delinquent card members that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience.  
It is unusual to see credit performance this strong in an environment like this. It all starts with the changes we've made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which give us a solid or gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance. Of course, like others, our customers are also helped by external factors such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. And that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves. 
Moving on to Slide 14, you will see that the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in the modeling of CECL reserves for the expected lifetime losses of the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenarios since Q3. But the 2 scenarios do remain sharply [ to aversion ].
In our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter, we continue to weight heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that I just spoke about. Despite this caution, the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release $674 million of reserves in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 15.  
This reserve release, coupled with our low write-offs, drove a provision expense benefit of $111 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $5.8 billion of reserves, representing 7.3% of our loan balances, 0.6% of our Card Member receivables balances, respectively. We believe that the reserves on our balance sheet, which are up $1.5 billion from the pre-pandemic levels, are appropriate, giving the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery.  
Turning now to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 16. Fourth quarter revenues were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend-lend and other travel-related revenues, member card fees continued to grow, as you can see on Slide 17.  
Net card fee growth remains strong throughout 2020 and grew 12% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter.  
Although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll continue to increase investments in this area this year, it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate. As a result, I do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate.  
Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on Slide 18. Net interest income declined 17% on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter. Net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 10 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk, mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances.  
Looking forward, I'd expect net interest income to be relatively flat to Q4 in the first quarter and then increase modestly as loan volumes recover.  
Turning next to our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This difference drove an 11 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since, as a reminder, we, on average, earn higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. The discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter. Looking forward into 2021, I'd expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of T&E recovery. 
Coming back to total revenues on Slide 20, you see that the overall revenue trends in 2020 have broadly moved in line with billed business trends given the spend-centric nature of our business model. While I would expect first quarter 2021 revenues to be broadly in line with Q4 outside of some impact from seasonality, if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned earlier, you'll probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you would see full year revenue growth that's somewhat lower or higher than that 9% to 10%.  
Moving on to Slide 21. We're continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 24% for the full year, driven by lower spending and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a 50% offset to the full year revenue declines we saw in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, that offset was closer to 40% as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. And I would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of 2021.  
Moving on to the marketing expense line. We invested $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we could spend as much as a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this year.  
Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions.  
Turning to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 6% year-over-year in 2020 as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our long-term strategies. In 2021, we expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum.  
Last, while you saw some quarterly volatility this year in our effective tax rate, the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below 23% and I'd expect around a 23% effective tax rate in 2021, absent any legislative changes.  
Turning next to capital and liquidity on Slide 22. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have been all year. Our CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.5% after hitting in the third quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the year at $54.6 billion and has been at record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet.  
We remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. We plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum Fed authorized capacity of around $440 million in Q1.  
Beyond Q1, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. To sum up, we feel good about how we've navigated through the unprecedented challenges of 2020, and we feel well positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in 2021. We now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment. The 2 areas that do remain harder to predict for 2021, though, are the same 2 we have talked about since the pandemic began: the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in T&E spending, as I mentioned earlier.  
That said, the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in 2021. And so on Slide 23, we have outlined 2 scenarios. Most importantly, scenario 1 assumes that the caution we have shown in our Q4 credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted. Such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4, and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $5. 
Scenario 2, most importantly, assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery, leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery. The combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger EPS outcome in the area of $7.  
In either scenario, our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum, along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts, not by focusing on a specific EPS outcome. We run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the long term. Although we can't predict precisely where 2021 EPS will land or provide an EPS guidance range at this time, we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely",650,"Yes. Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios. But let's talk about the first part of the string here. And then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we're in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year. I mean, when we were talking last year at any given point in time, we didn't have a vaccine. 
And so while the vaccine right now is, what I would call it, fits and starts, I mean, is there enough -- at the beginning, there wasn't enough places to sort of -- to do vaccine distribution. Now they have vaccine distribution points, but you don't have enough vaccine to distribute, hard to get appointments. There's -- so there's a lot of disconnect. That will sort itself out. And it will sort itself out over a period of a couple of months, not over a couple of years. And so we believe that by June or so, you will either have sort of a herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity. 
The other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pent-up demand for travel. It's probably -- and nobody on this call that doesn't want to travel or go someplace or don't know their friends or family don't want to do the same thing. And so when we look at it, I don't think you'll see a widespread international travel, but you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being domestic travel here in the United States, domestic travel sort of within the European Union, things like that. You're probably not going to see a lot of long-haul this year. 
And so look, I'm fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel. I mean, we're talking about consumer travel potentially being back about 80% with overall travel being back about 70%. Business travel will come back a little bit slower. But I'd be shocked if we're sitting here at this time next year and we say, geez, well, we really missed it on travel. I just don't see that happening. I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines. But again, these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace. 
I mean, what do you have? Like 20 million people in the United States at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that, and it's only January. And so I believe that as we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel. I think cruise lines, that's more of a 2022 phenomenon. So we feel really good about consumer travel coming back. I think our airline partner with Delta, Ed said the same thing on his earnings call. So we feel real confident about that. 
And as far as new cards, I mean, look, new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix. But what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast, not the scenarios, is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because you're not going to have those card members traveling right out of the gate, they'll probably be more of a second half phenomenon. And so their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal. 
Having said that, we are really focused on getting -- we don't talk a lot about cards, but cards lead to billed business acquired, which we do talk a lot about. We are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine, and we believe there are a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards."

I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 20",366,"Sanjay, I'll add 2 things on cards and then talk about reserves. I would point out on cards. We were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 2019 levels. That's a really good sign to us. 
The other point I'd make is just to reiterate what Steve said is that it's really a 2022 impact to a great extent. 2021 is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers. It won't affect the 2021 results that much because the 2021 results, then to go to your last question, are all about what happens. It's credit. 
And I guess I'd encourage everyone to think about 2 numbers. So I cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year, we now end the year with $1.5 billion more in credit reserves. We also, relative to the beginning of the year, ended the year with $1.2 billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs. And yet I also pointed out that historically, 80% of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs, we end up collecting and doing fine with. 
So what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook. And so you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy. Small businesses going bankrupt, lots of consumers being laid off, you have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed. So we're not making an economic call, Sanjay. We're saying, well, if all that bad stuff happens, like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast, then we're going to need all those reserves we have on the books, and you're probably that's sort of where the low scenario comes from. 
Conversely, if, while rocky, there's a fairly steady recovery, we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario. So we'll have to see. But either way, our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year because it's all about 2022."

I mean, when we look at new card acquisition, our Platinum and our Gold levels were at levels of 2019, and so we feel really good about that. I think our Cashback cards were actually doing quite well as well. What we have not seen, and this makes all the sense in the world, is our co-brand acquisition. And our co-brand acquisition, I mean, look, the reason you do co-brand cards, you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners, but you also get tremendous distribution. And right now, not a lot of people stay in hotels, not a lot of people taking flights. So you lose the distribution opportunities. 
Having said that, what our co-brand cards, though, are performing either in the United States or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective because, as I've said all along, people spend to gather those points to take those trips because they have such a pent-up demand for travel. And our retention numbers on our co-brand cards are at the same levels they were in 2019. So we feel good about proprietary acquisition, which again, is being driven by Platinum and Gold and some Cashback. Our co-brand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our -- the co-brand channels. 
But having said that, our co-brand performance is really, really good. And Ed made that comment, Ed Bastian made that comment in his earnings remarks as well. So hopefully, Betsy, we provided a little bit of -- somewhere around the answer you -- I answered the question you were trying to ask before you got cut off."

And that's why I told you what we're going to manage OpEx to and what we might spend on marketing. And we're going to do those things because we're all about rebuilding growth momentum this year. 
The ultimate credit outcome and just how quickly discount revenues come back is going to be driven by the external environment. And that's why you have a low and a high scenario, but it really is not going to impact how we run the company this year, which of those 2 scenarios comes out.

We are planning, provided we have and we have light to -- we see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of investment opportunities, we will continue to invest and take advantage of all those investment opportunities that are available to us. If they're not there, we'll pull back. But we believe they will be there. We will look to ramp up our card acquisition. We will look at value injection early on in the year. We'll look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year. We're going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the United States. We're going to drive really hard at international acceptance. 
I mean, look, we signed 3.7 million merchants internationally last year, not including China. Take China off the table for a second, but we're going to drive international acceptance, as we've said. We're going to continue to work and invest in our network. We're going to launch Kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers. And we're going to get some traction in China as well. So we are really focused in 2021 in investing across all dimensions of our -- each one of our business lines and preparing ourselves for 2022 by building that strong foundation of retaining card members, acquiring new ones and building that merchant network and continuing to build up network capabilities and digital capabilities.

I mean what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company, which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing. And we have a very clear plan in 2021 to manage those to about $11.5 billion. That is below 2019 levels. If you were to look at some businesses we've sold over the years, it's frankly about where the number was a decade ago, in 2012 and 2013. 
So I think -- we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what I think of as the infrastructure cost of the company, which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow, there's tremendous leverage from holding that a little below 2019 level. There's always a little bit of quarterly noise, particularly the Q4, some of the lines in OpEx you'll see every year, if you go back and look at history, go up a little bit. But that's the disciplined approach that we're taking here. So I don't know if I got to the number of your question, Rick, but that's probably how we think about it."

So I think the team has done a really good job of, on an ongoing basis, taking expense out and then putting in investment back in. And so as you think about this, what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base. And the way we look at it, that's providing us leverage. So if we think about the core business that we had, we're getting enough leverage out that to fund other opportunities within the business, whether that be Kabbage, whether that be the acquisition of a Mezi or a Resy or a lounge buddy, so forth and so on. And yet, you go back 10 years, we're at the same place. And so we believe, when we look at it as managers of the business, we're getting tremendous operating leverage because we're able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating cost and that's how we look at it."

So Steve, you noted in your color that for 2022, you expect T&E to be, on the consumer side, to be fully recovered and a healthy economy. So maybe first, can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending? You outlined OpEx and marketing this year could be $4.5 billion. Will there be a pullback in spending? Or could we see revenues accelerating as card member growth picks up? 
And then secondly, you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below pre-COVID levels. We're in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pent-up demand, like myself, but can't leverage anything in the near term. So can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and how you're thinking about product refreshes? And does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of what's included in the value proposition?"
92001,698647477,2251227,"American Express Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think becaus",801,"Yes. So I think let's talk about the second one first. And if I remember the first question, I'll come back to it. It seemed like a couple of minutes ago. So I'm just teasing you, Ryan. But when I -- when we look at sort of value injection, I think because people couldn't travel, what we tried to do was to do 2 things: to not only provide them value in the short term, but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card. And so when you look at what we did with Platinum and with OPEN Platinum and Centurion, by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits, we had 78% of our U.S. Platinum card members take advantage of those -- of that value injection. We had about 50% of our small business customers take advantage of that. 
But the really interesting point, in consumer Platinum, 17% of our base was not putting wireless on their card. They are now. So we had an uptick of 17%. Now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult. Recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have. And so for the first time, 17% of our Platinum card base actually put wireless on a card, which is you might think surprising, but people put spending in compartments, and 10% put streaming on the card. 
So the value injection is meant for us to do 2 things: number one, steer people where we want them to go; and number two, provide real value to them. And we did that. And I think that, that has really helped us from a retention perspective because, obviously, people want value. We'll continue to do that. And then we'll look at our overall value propositions just as we've had over the course of the last 3 years and continue to refresh those. And I think you'll see those refreshed and we'll expand the aperture of that. 
So you will expand beyond traditional T&E value proposition enhancements. We'll look at other T&E value proposition enhancements because safety in traveling will become even more important, I think, to our premium cardholders. And we'll work with our partners. A lot of the value we put in is either co-funded or merchant funded, and we'll continue to work with our partners to do that. 
So we have -- we feel really good about the retention that we saw, and we feel really good about the value injection because of the behavioral shift that it drove, and we believe that, that will be sticky, which is why you see an increase in our non-T&E spending on a sequential basis, and we believe that will continue. So that's the first part. 
As far as the second part of the question, look, we do believe -- the first question was, we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pent-up demand. I just -- I see the vaccines working. We see herd immunity coming, and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter. If, God forbid, the vaccines, the efficacy proves it doesn't work, we got a whole different issue for the entire economy, and we're not talking about American Express traveling. We're talking about different things at this particular point. But all indications are vaccine will work, it will be distributed and off we'll go. 
As far as corporate spending, look, our corporate card business, which is near and dear to all of us, drives about 9% of our overall billings and about 60% of that is T&E. There are companies that are still traveling. And the T&E piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines. It's across lodging, it's across restaurants, it's across car rental, and it's across air as well. And so we have pharmaceutical sales reps that travel by car, they stay in hotels and they spend food. That's still going on. Where you see not a lot of T&E spending is consultants who cannot go actually to their clients. But when you think about industrials and manufacturing, that is still going on. And you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts. 
But having said that, we don't anticipate that coming back, but we don't believe that's a big driver of our overall profitability. As we've said, it's not a big driver of our revenue. That 9% billings does not equate to either 9% revenue or 9% profitability. And we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our corporate card business."

And it's like I've always said, I always focus on discount rate by industry and mix overall because if you look at sort of where we are right now, at 2.25% or -- I think that's where we are right now, is 2.25%, is ""Oh my God, you're at 2.25%."" But you're at 2.25% with 65% T&E decline. 
And so as T&E comes back, that MDR will move back up, but OptBlue will not have any pressure at all in that discount rate. So we expect, as T&E moves up, overall discount rate will go up. But having said that, if T&E -- if non-T&E winds up going through the roof, and that puts pressure on MDR, that's fine. We're okay with that. Because, again, we manage this industry by industry, and I can't control mix. But if, in fact, our non-T&E, which is -- has a lower MDR on average than T&E, if that continues to grow and grow, I think everybody would be happy with that."

You don't know if that's going to be done on debt collection, you don't know where that will be. But look, we've been around 170 years, through lots and lots of administrations. We started this sort of regulatory journey, I guess, over the last -- really, really focused on our industry over the last 15 years or so. And it all started, I think, with UDAP. And look, we'll comply. We will comply, and we will do what we need to do. And I don't think it's going to be a major deterrent to us running our business in any way. 
I mean, look, have we added more compliance people over the years? Yes. Do we spend more time with regulators? Yes. Will -- could that be more? Yes, it could probably be more. But when you think about the underlying economics of our business, I really don't think it's going to impact our spend. And if you think about our model, our model is a get the card, have a fee, spend and then we have lend. We're not as dependent on lending revenues or lending profits as our competitors are, which is probably where a lot of regulation will come in, if it does come in. 
So we'll just see how that all plays out. And we've been through -- I've been through many administrations since I've been at American Express. We'll do what's required, and we've moved on.

What's interesting, Bob, is that we are adding a lot of locations.

And so they're down a little bit more. But we believe that will come back. And so we haven't run the numbers on sort of market share at this particular point. But as you know, we were certainly gaining market share in like 8 of the key markets that we participate in. And we believe, again, that there's that pent-up demand for travel, our attrition numbers are the same, showing the same sort of signs that they show in the United States. When we talk about attrition, we talk about global attrition, and there really is no difference between international, how international is performing versus how the U.S. is performing. So we feel good that, that will come back and both small business and consumer international were 2 of the fastest growing areas. 
As far as Kabbage goes, I think the thing that we're really excited about is Kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses. And so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan, to get a term loan, to have now a business checking account, to be able to have your card product, to do cash flow analysis on the platform, it gives us sort of an all-in-one platform to serve the needs of small businesses, which is why we did that and what we've been shooting for over the last couple of years, it was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us. And that will be -- we'll be rolling that out end of Q1 into Q2 and continuing to make enhancements on Kabbage.

So I do think it's just important to understand, we compete on many, many fronts. And while the consumer business is a large piece of it and probably the most highly competitive, and it has been for probably 10 years. 
Look, we anticipate that not only JPMorgan, but Bank of America, Citi, Capital, everybody is going to be out there looking to get card members to bring more into the fold and to drive top line revenue. So I don't think there's been a step down in competition. I think you will see a -- I think Jamie said on his call, he's stepping up his investments.

And I think they do a really great job running their business, and we've got a lot of respect for them. And so I'm sure they'll figure out how to integrate this into their value propositions to compete in the most effective way that they deem is the right way to go about it. And we'll continue to do what we do, and we feel good about the hand that we hold and off we'll go, and we'll see what happens.

In the U.K. and Europe more generally, as you would expect, Craig, you saw in December and now into January some significant declines in restaurants and other T&E. But what you continue to see stability in, though, is the non-T&E spending. So it's an interesting observation that as Europe has locked down more, it has the expected impact on restaurants and lodging, the people who were doing locally. But it doesn't have an impact on non-T&E. And to go to Australia, Australia, like many of our non-U.S. markets, was heavily, heavily -- or more heavily than the U.S. driven by T&E. And of course, T&E, that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross-border travel, and there are also many restrictions on cross-state travel within Australia. So non-T&E spending in Australia, as it does around the world, looks good. But the T&E spending, while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world, that's not where the bigger dollars are. 
The bigger dollars is on -- are in other parts of travel, and that's going to be slower to come back and is going to await a lessening of the government lockdowns."

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say that our overall core business performance is",1578,"Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say that our overall core business performance is slightly better than our expectations, with credit performance continuing to be best-in-class. And we're especially encouraged about the progress we're making toward our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022. 
As I discussed in January, we're looking at 2021 as a transition year, where our focus is on investing to rebuild growth momentum by firing up our core business, scaling expertising opportunities while continuing to retain financial flexibility. And while I feel good about our results for the quarter, what I feel really good about is the progress we're making to rebuild momentum. 
When we talk about firing up the core, we're looking for meaningful progress in 4 areas: spending volumes coming back to pre-pandemic levels, bringing new customers into the franchise, retaining and deepening relationships with our current customers and signing up additional merchants. We're making good progress in all these areas. 
Overall spending on American Express cards in Q1 continued the sequential improvements we saw through the last 2 quarters of 2020. U.S. volumes exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and spending in March from U.S. consumer and small- and medium-sized enterprise customers was higher than March 2019 levels. Non-U.S. volume lagged a bit due to renewed lockdowns in certain international countries. 
Excluding travel and entertainment categories, spending on our cards in Q1 was up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019 levels. This marked the third straight quarter of positive growth. And although the T&E volumes were significantly lower in the first quarter versus last year, we've seen a steady sequential upward trend in monthly T&E spending and a noticeable improvement in recent weeks, particularly in the U.S., as the vaccine rollout accelerated. These trends indicate that the pent-up demand for consumer travel we've been talking about is real, and it increases our confidence that the domestic -- that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover as the year progresses. 
In terms of bringing new customers into the franchise, card acquisitions are also gaining momentum and were up sequentially in the quarter globally. In fact, new accounts acquired on key premium U.S. consumer and small business products were above 2019 levels and exceeded the prior quarters. Initial spending on these new cards is strong, and the average FICO scores of these new U.S. consumer and small business card members are higher than those acquired pre-pandemic. 
In addition, card acquisitions in some of our largest travel co-brand portfolios have accelerated since the fourth quarter, an important indicator that travel remains an attractive category for consumers over the long term. 
Another indicator of building momentum in our core business is retaining and increasing engagement with existing card members. We have a good story to tell here as well. Card Member attrition on our proprietary products, which also includes our co-brands, continues to be lower than in the previous years, and customer satisfaction levels remain higher than pre-COVID levels. The additional value we provided on several of our premium products helped drive Card Member loyalty and spending in 2020, and as we believe, has been sustained into this year. 
For example, 95% of U.S. Platinum Card members who took advantage of the streaming credits and 88% who use wireless credits offered last year are continuing to spend in these categories months later. We're also seeing good engagement on the new offers we rolled out earlier in the first quarter for Platinum Card members, which includes statement credits with PayPal and other select merchants. The uptake on these offers are in line with the wireless and streaming offers we announced last year. 
Overall, Card Member engagement with our digital channels and capabilities is at an all-time high, in most areas. For example, over 88% of our U.S. Card Members are making their payments digitally, and 87% use our website or app for self-service. The number of Amex offers redeemed in Q1 increased fivefold versus last year's first quarter, topping 5.3 million redemptions. 
Finally, we continue to see strong adoption of Pay It Plan It, our Buy Now Pay Later feature, after we recently expanded the capability to all U.S. consumer cards. Since launching Pay It Plan It, card members have created over 6 million plans totaling over $5 billion of accounts receivable. 
Another key driver of momentum is expanding merchant coverage. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress growing merchant coverage internationally while maintaining our coverage levels in the U.S. When it comes to building momentum, we aren't just focused on the near term. We're also focused on scaling next horizon opportunities that will drive growth over the longer term. 
China represents an exciting opportunity in this regard. As you know, developing our card processing network in Mainland China has been a priority for us, and we're pleased with our progress. Since getting the green light to start processing payments in China 8 months ago, we have reached mobile wallet parity coverage through our partnerships with China's major mobile wallet providers. And to date, we have added over 14 million merchants to the network at the point of sale with more to come. A key enabler of our coverage growth in China is the progress we're making to modernize our network, particularly in adding the capability to process debit transactions globally, which is an essential need for customers in China and helps us prepare for potential additional debit applications elsewhere. We remain focused on scaling our China business by acquiring card members through the relationships we've established with 16 issuing partners, and I look forward to sharing more highlights of our progress over the course of the year. 
In our commercial business, our growth has been and will continue to be driven primarily by small- and medium-sized enterprises. A key element of our longer-term growth strategy for SMA franchise is to deepen our relationships with current customers and attract new ones by offering a range of supplier payment and cash flow management solutions, both on and beyond the card, giving business owners more tools to help them manage their businesses. Kabbage is one example of how we plan to bring this strategy to life. We've been focused on integrating Kabbage's digital capabilities into our business. And in Q1, we began the rollout of the Kabbage platform, which includes a business checking account and working capital solutions to our small business customers. 
In our consumer business, Resy, our online dining platform, helps drive bookings and spending at restaurants, which is a top category for our Card Members. When a pandemic hit, Resy quickly pivoted its value proposition for restaurant owners to help them expand their offerings and find new ways to attract customers, including enabling takeout, meal kits, family meals and virtual events. Resy also provided a number of special offers for Amex card members. As a result, over the past year, Resy has seen significant growth and engagement for both consumers and restaurants. In fact, we've seen a number of reservations booked on the platform more than doubled since December. And Amex card members who use Resy are some of our highest spending and most profitable customers. 
Those are just some of the examples of our progress in rebuilding our growth momentum, both in our core business and with next horizon opportunities. 
Importantly, as we've increased our investments in both categories, we've also been focused on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We resumed share repurchases this quarter, and our capital ratios continue to be well above our targets. 
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to share some thoughts on where I see things heading in the near term. As I sit here a little over a year since the global COVID pandemic started, I'm optimistic that the hopeful signs we're seeing as vaccine distribution accelerates will continue and get stronger as we move through the year. Of course, we're still cautiously keeping an eye on the progression of the virus and its impact on local lockdowns and cross-border travel restrictions in certain areas. But there are clear indicators that the economy is improving, particularly in the U.S., and I believe this will translate into continued steady improvements for American Express. 
Given all of this, we remain firmly committed to executing on our 2020 investment strategy for a building growth momentum for the longer term. As I said last quarter, we're not focused on achieving a particular EPS target this year. Instead, we're focused on achieving our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on our financial growth algorithm going forward. I'm encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2021, which makes me even more confident in our road map for achieving our 2022 aspiration. I'm particularly proud of our colleagues who have remained nimble and focused through the uncertainties of the past year. Their dedication and hard work, along with the flexibility of our business model, the loyalty of our customer base, the strength of our partnerships and the value of our brand make me feel very good about the future. 
Jeff will now walk you through our results, and we will take questions after that."

It's good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect good progress towards the aspirations we have for 2022 that Steve just outlined. As I've said since the beginning of th",2806,"Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect good progress towards the aspirations we have for 2022 that Steve just outlined. 
As I've said since the beginning of the pandemic last year, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends, along with, this year, the marketing investments we are making to rebuild growth momentum. I'll spend most of my time this morning on these topics. But first, looking at the summary financials on Slide 3. 
When you consider year-over-year results, last year's first quarter included 2 months of pre-pandemic results. And so as you would expect, first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. But in contrast, while we don't typically look at monthly results, were you to look at our revenues in just the month of March, you'd see that they were up 7% year-over-year. 
Our first quarter net income was $2.2 billion, and earnings per share was $2.74. Included in these results is a $1.05 billion credit reserve release due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and continued strong credit performance. 
So now let's get into the first key driver of our performance volumes, beginning with a few comments on some nomenclature changes we have made to our volume reporting. Thinking ahead on how we expect our card processing network in Mainland China to grow in the coming quarters and years, we have renamed what we previously called GNS bill business as processed volumes, because our business model in China is unique and different from what we do with our GNS partners in other regions. We have also changed what we previously referred to as proprietary billed business to just billed business and renamed what we used to call our overall volumes from billed business to network volumes. You will see we've recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release as well as on appendix, Slide 27. 
So with these changes in mind, moving on to our volume performance on Slide 4, we saw continued recovery across all of our volumes in the first quarter, with total network and billed business volumes down 8% and 9%, respectively, and processed volumes down only 1%, all on an FX-adjusted basis. 
Getting into the details of our billed business growth, which you will see several views of on slides 5 through 10, we've shown first quarter trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, in order to provide a clearer picture of how spending is recovering as we begin to lap the onset of the pandemic in March of last year. I'd also note that the trends we've seen in the first 2 weeks of April are a continuation of the trends we saw exiting the first quarter that I'll focus on this morning. 
In addition, it remains important to look at spending on travel and entertainment categories separately from spending in other categories, which we will now be calling goods and services spending, given the very different impacts that pandemic has had on these 2 very different categories. Overall, there are a few key points I'd suggest is the takeaways on volumes from all of these slides. 
First, there are clear signs of volume momentum that we feel good about. As you can see on Slide 5, our overall billed business volume growth continued to recover steadily throughout the months of the first quarter, with the reopening of the economy and rollout of the vaccines progressing well in the U.S. and certain other geographies. Spending on goods and services, which represents the vast majority or 86% of our volumes, exceeded our expectations, growing 6% year-over-year and up 11% versus 2019 in the quarter and up 15% in the month of March. Spending on travel and entertainment also showed sequential improvement given the progress on the medical front in the U.S., further reinforcing our view that consumer and small business travel will recover over time. 
Second, the growth in goods and services spending has continued to improve steadily in both our consumer and commercial businesses. In consumer shown on Slide 6, we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, which was up 23% year-over-year this quarter even as the recovery of offline spending accelerated, driving goods and services volumes up 7% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. 
In commercial, as you can see on Slide 7, SME spending remains the most resilient across our customer types, supported by continued growth in B2B spending, which drove overall commercial spend on goods and services up 5% year-over-year and up 8% versus 2019 in the first quarter. 
Third, we are seeing a faster pace of spending recovery in the U.S. versus other regions. As shown on Slide 8, the total volumes from our U.S. consumer and SME customers are recovering faster than other customer types and were up 1% versus 2019 levels in the month of March, even with the continued drag of T&E spend not yet fully recovering. 
International consumer and SME spending, on the other hand, is recovering more slowly due to renewed restrictions in key international geographies and the fact that historically, we tend to have more travel-related spending in our international regions. And large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily travel and entertainment, continued to be down the most during the first quarter, as we expected, since this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. 
Fourth, T&E spending, though still down significantly, did improve steadily across all categories throughout the months of the first quarter. And consumer T&E continued to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We expect this trend to continue given the pent-up demand to travel that we see in our consumer base and the positive early signs of domestic travel recovery that we see in the U.S. as the vaccine rollout progresses. 
So to sum up on spending volumes, we feel good about the steady growth we are seeing in goods and services spending, and we expect it to continue to grow throughout 2021. On T&E spending, the trends we've seen in the first quarter are encouraging and give us more confidence in our current assumption that by Q4, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of its Q4 2019 levels, led by recovery in U.S. consumer domestic travel. 
Turning next to the other key volume driver, receivable and loan balances on Slide 11. Receivable balances were down 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with spending volumes. Loan balances, however, were down 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year more than spending volumes, as we continued to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which relates to the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in just a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes. 
So turning next to our second key driver, credit and provision on Slides 12 through 16. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. We continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 53% and 82% year-over-year, respectively, as you can see on Slide 12. We attribute this performance to our robust risk management practices, the premium nature of our customer base as well as the unprecedented level of government stimulants and forbearance programs. Clearly, macroeconomic forecasts have improved over the last 90 days, as you can see on Slide 13. However, we still have 2 very different macroeconomic forecast scenarios, and we continued to put significant weight on the downside scenario in the modeling we did to calculate our first quarter credit reserves. 
The impact of the improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models, coupled with the sequential decline in loan and receivables balances and our strong credit performance, led us to release $1.05 billion of reserves. This reserve release and our extremely low write-offs drove a provision expense benefit of $675 million in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 14. That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $2.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on Slide 15. In the coming quarters, we will see how the card members exiting our financial relief programs will perform. That will be an important milestone for us, though I would observe that all of the early exit performance indicators have looked quite strong. 
There also continues to be some uncertainty in the medical environment and the vaccine rollout, and we'll have to see how that plays out. And so we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. Slide 16 shows you this in that we ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of reserves representing 6.4% of our loan balances and 0.5% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. 
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to rebuild growth momentum on Slide 17. We invested $1 billion in marketing in the first quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisitions while maintaining our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.1 million new cards in the first quarter, up around 20% sequentially. Importantly, the number of new accounts we acquired on our premium fee-based products was up 35% versus Q4, with acquisition volumes on many of our premium U.S. consumer and small business products exceeding 2019 levels. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we continued to expect to spend a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this full year. Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities and the pace at which we wind down our value-injection efforts, as our customers begin again to experience the full benefits of our existing value propositions. 
So what do our 3 key drivers mean for our financial performance this quarter? As I said earlier, year-over-year revenues on Slides 18 and 19 are impacted by the prior year quarter, including 2 pre-pandemic months. So first quarter revenues were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily driven by volume declines impacting net discount revenue and net interest income, as well as declines in travel-related revenues and delinquencies impacting other commissions and fees and other revenues. 
Net card fees, however, grew 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 20, demonstrating the impact of the strong continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. Looking forward, I expect the growth rate of net card fees will slow for a few more quarters, driven by our decision last year to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the beginning of the pandemic. Given the renewed momentum we are now beginning to see in new card acquisitions, I would expect net card fee growth to then reaccelerate. 
Moving on to net interest income on Slide 21, you see that net interest income declined 22% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. While the primary driver of this is the decline in loan volumes, net interest yield on our Card Member loans also decreased 60 basis points due to the higher paydown rates from revolving card members on our credit card products. Looking forward, I expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. 
Volumes are also the primary driver of the discount revenue trends you see on Slide 22. As expected, though, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business. The average discount rate declined 8 basis points year-over-year, driven by the greater declines we saw in T&E spending where we, on average, earn higher discount rates. The year-over-year erosion in the first quarter is a bit less than in Q4 due to the recovery in T&E spending throughout the quarter that I spoke about earlier. Looking forward, we still expect that if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned previously, you'd probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you could see full year revenue growth, but somewhat lower or higher than that 9% or 10%. 
Moving on to expenses. We are continuing to break out on Slide 23 our variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 10% year-over-year. Relative to the past few quarters, we did experience higher usage of travel-related benefits and rewards, which we see as a clear sign of the pent-up demand we've been talking about. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the next few quarters. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio, partially offset by some higher deferred and other compensation expenses. In 2021, we still expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum. 
Turning next to capital and liquidity. On Slide 23, our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 14.8% in the first quarter, our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the quarter at $61.5 billion, far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year. 
We resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.3 million shares. And we remain committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. In Q2, we plan to repurchase shares up to the maximum amount permitted under the Fed authorized capacity of around $900 million. Looking forward, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. 
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in Q1 might mean for the future. In January, I laid out 2 scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happened with credit reserves. Our original scenario 1, or low scenario, assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year, and that we would not release any credit reserves in the year. Now 3 months into the year, the macro outlook has improved, and credit performance has remained very strong. So we've already released $1.05 billion of reserves. This still leaves us, however, with a lot of credit reserves we've built due to economic uncertainty. 
So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 25 assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical and economic environment does not improve further, and that we, therefore, do not release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $6 per share. 
Our updated scenario 2 in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 9% to 10% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as $7.50. 
More importantly, in either scenario, as I said earlier, our marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see not by a focus on any specific EPS outcome for 2021. What we are focused on is managing the company to rebuild growth momentum and achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations that we had for 2020 and 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

So in 2022, we're really assuming, Don, that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it was pre-pandemic. Small business lagging that a bit, and then large and global corporation travel still being well below its 2019 levels. 
The other comment I would make about 2022 is domestic travel in the U.S. and around the globe will be the fuel that gets us to that level. We would still expect cross-border travel to be a little weaker next year than it was in 2019, just given the likely lingering number of cross-border restrictions that you've seen. 
As of how we feel about our Q4 assumption, look, we had a clear inflection point this quarter in the U.S., and so we feel good. But Steve, you may want to add a few?"

No, I think that those -- the assumptions that Jeff just went through are exactly the assumptions we have in our calculus here. But I think when you look at this quarter and you look at the trends that we're seeing, I mean, we're seeing an increase in bookings, right? So we're seeing our travel bookings are up 50% over the -- this quarter up 50% over Q4 '20. 
When you look at -- and we look at this really carefully. When you look at February versus March, in March now, we were 50% of 2019 bookings, and that was 19%. So we have 31% in February and then went to 50%. So we feel really good about that. 
When we also start to really dig into the data, we start to look at sort of cohorts of spending. And we're seeing people that are younger are getting back at a much higher level. Their overall T&E spending is probably about 85% to 90% and almost 100% back to where they were in 2019 in restaurants. And then when we look at older people, as they get vaccinated, we're seeing sequential growth month-on-month as we look at their growth. And so if you look at just people over 45, you're seeing an 11% increase in their overall T&E spending month-to-month. We -- that's only going to get better for us as we move along. 
And the last thing that gives us a lot of great hope is, is redemptions, is MR redemptions. I mean when you go back and look at sort of MR redemptions that we had, our MR point redemptions in the fourth quarter for [ air ] was like 30%. And it's up to 54%. So we are -- we're doing some good things here. And our customers are doing some good things. And we'll continue to make sure that we're retaining these customers because they're going to spend. And as Jeff said, our co-brand cards are doing quite well as well. 
So all of that leads to, again, in an environment that continues to improve, us having a lot of confidence in hitting our 2020 plan [ and ] 2022."

All that said, if you -- if I take it back to January, the then $5 low scenario assumed that the world would be so tough this year that you would not end up releasing any credit reserves. So we just released $1.05 billion of reserves. That's about $1. That takes you from $5 to $6. So your $6 assumes, once again, the world from here is suddenly going to get really tough, and you're not going to release any more reserves. 
At the high end, yes, we had assumed you release some modest level of reserves, which is why the high end only went up from $7 to $7.50. 
So that's how we thought about it. I just want to close though, by again emphasizing we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome this year. We're incredibly focused on what we're trying to achieve for 2022."

And we've said we're not going to have people really come back until after Labor Day. You're seeing other companies sort of gradually get back into it. So I think the step 1. 
First step is let's get people back into the office, and then companies are going to say, ""Okay, how comfortable I am having visitors into the building?"" And my anticipation is most companies will start opening -- start the process of reopening in the United States now, July through sort of September, and get to some capacity level. I mean -- and you guys have your own situations yourselves, where you're -- most of you are probably sitting at home today. 
So I think what's going to happen is it's going to be slow, which is why we really haven't assumed a lot of corporate T&E coming back and a lot of travel coming back. Having said that, corporate tiny takes many forms. We do have salespeople that are out and on the road and calling on accounts. And there's car rental and there's gas, and they're still staying at hotels and restaurants. And so I think for a segment of it. 
And I think when you look at a segment of our, let's call them, industrial corporate T&E corporate customers, they have people that are going to plants and visiting, making customer calls and so forth. I think that eventually, what will happen is investment banks and consultants are going to want to go out and meet with their clients again. There's been a lot of deals that have been done, a lot of relationships that have been built. But there's nothing like in person. I just think it will take a bit of time. 
And look, there's also -- there's that substitution. It's a substitution of WebEx and Zoom and what have you, which is why we've been talking 2023 before it gets back to 2019 levels. And I think with that assumption, we feel good about hitting that 2020 aspiration in 2022. So when you think about what goes into our assumption for 2022, you've got a slower return of international. You've got a much lower return of corporate, and yet we're saying we'll be at 2020 levels. 
And so is there upside from a consumer perspective on travel? I think that all depends on the rollout of the vaccine, governments opening up their borders and things like that. I think from a domestic travel perspective, pent-up -- there's pent-up demand. In talking at [ Baskin ] and talking to [ Chris Nista ], they're seeing a lot of bookings out front. I just went through some of our travel data. 
So as we go through this, I think what's going to be the key thing to watch for is how much does international travel come back from a consumer. And we're assuming that sort of now in the second half of 2022, okay, not in -- not really this year. 
And I think the other thing you're seeing, Mark, is you're seeing a divergence. I mean you see what's going on in India right now. There's a lot of countries that are having different results and different situations as it relates to the vaccine. But one thing is inarguable. The more vaccine rollout, the more people feel confident. The more people feel confident, the more they'll get out and spend. And that's why I think when you look at sort of the -- towards the end of the second quarter into third quarter in the summer, you're going to see people hitting the road, you're going to see people hitting the skies, especially in the U.S."

We -- there was a 35% jump in premium cards that we saw in this particular quarter. And acquisition of Platinum and Gold cards was well above pre-pandemic levels. So we feel good about that. And just to give you some sort of contrast on that, when you look at our fee-based products, it's still a little bit lower. I mean, we're acquiring about 60%. It was about 70% in 2019, but sequential increases have helped. We're seeing co-brand cards come back. 
I mean we talked about 90% more Delta cards acquired in this quarter than in the previous quarter. And we're seeing a higher-level customer. I mentioned that in my remarks. The FICO is a lot higher, and we're seeing good spending. So we feel good about both our small business and consumer. We don't really talk about geographic distribution and things like that. But our intent is not only to acquire cards, but we also -- when we talk about it, we acquire, billed business. And we're on track to do from a billed business acquired perspective where we were in 2019. So we feel good about that."

And so we'll talk more as we refresh those products, and we'll give you a little bit more color on that. 
I take the opposite view on sort of the travel value propositions. I think they're actually going to be even stronger at this point. I think that people are going to want to have the safety and security of our lounges. We're opening up more lounges. We're not backing away from these lounges. In fact, we've opened up numerous lounges during the pandemic. And they've turned into a little bit more of an oasis for people where they know, with our brand, our security and our reputation, we're going to take as good care of people in our lounges as possible. And I think the other thing that there's a lot of questions we got at this time last year was, ""Geez, what's the future of your travel co-brand cards?"" 
And when we look at the month of March, and we look at sort of Delta and we look at Hilton as just 2 examples, they're 2019 spending levels overall and because people have been accumulating points and people want status. And as I've said numerous times on these calls, status is probably even going to be more important going forward. 
So what we will continue to do is we're not going to walk away from our travel value propositions. If anything, I've been more encouraged that we did the right things, and we'll continue to add though. I mean I think if you look at our history over the last 3 years or so, 3.5 years, we've kept our core value proposition and continued to add. And during the pandemic, I talked about the results we had with wireless and the results we had with streaming, we got customers who were not using our card for those things, by putting some value in, we're now 4 months after the value and they're still spending. And we're doing the same thing right now. We've got a PayPal Credit for our Platinum cardholders, and we're picking up more card members that didn't use PayPal. And as I've talked about PayPal and I've talked about some of the other Fintech Square and Stripe and so forth, they've actually not only helped us get more coverage but have helped us in ways to deliver more value to our card members. So we feel good about our value propositions. We feel good about the travel value propositions that are in our products, but we will continue to expand and evolve our value propositions as we have over time. We're not walking away from that strategy."

And as we've talked about travel coming back, it comes back in layers. It comes back with consumer, then it's SME and then it's large and corporate. So it is a very different business. And which is why we went and acquired Kabbage to have a digital front for these SMEs where they can not only get their card spending done, but also get working capital loans, have a transaction banking account, have merchant financing loan, have short-term loans and things like that. Because small businesses, small and midsized businesses use this card to really help to run their businesses, which is a fundamental difference between how corporations use the card, which is to support T&E. And obviously, there's B2B opportunities with large corporates. But that's why small business has come back. 
What our small businesses have done, I think, even better than what you might have thought is, is the dispersion that we have across the small business arenas, and I've said this many times. When people think about small businesses, they tend to think about the small retail shop, what they tend to think about the small restaurant. The reality is a lot of them didn't do so well during this time. We don't have a tremendous amount of our small business base there. It is a very diverse base. And when you think about professional services, you think about cooling and plumbing and electric and all those things, our base is very wide.

And either tactically or strategically, how will you respond?"

I think our competitors got into this more after the financial crisis when they really looked at this and said, this was a very attractive business. The reality is the Card Act had a lot less impact on us because, remember, 80% of our revenues are not from interest and the fact that interest rates, especially on prior balances, were now controlled, really had less impact on us than it did at our competitors. Our competitors wound up just growing their overall business. And one of the first things they did is hire a lot of people from American Express to do that. 
But look, I think that the lessons that we've learned over time -- and look, I've always said this, we welcome competition. The lessons that we learned over time is you need to continue to focus in on what your customer needs are and how your customer is changing and evolving. And this is why when I took over, one of the first things I said is we're going to go to a strategy of refreshing our products on a real ongoing basis. You cannot have your green cards sit out there for 30 years and think it's still as relevant 30 years ago as it is today. 
Millennials was really not as much a Card Act. Millennials was us opening our eyes to the fact that our value proposition had a much broader appeal. And I think that we really started to communicate that. And look, and I've said this publicly before, I think your company there did a great job of really highlighting premium cards. I'm talking about JPMorgan, and Gordon and his team did a fantastic job of highlighting premium cards to millennials. And our value proposition played remarkably well there. And as I just said, 60% of our cards that we just acquired are millennials. I think we had to expand our aperture, and we did that. We expanded that aperture, and we realized that the value proposition that we had could have a wider audience and could have a wider target, and we've done that. And we will continue to do that. You will continue to see that from a multicultural perspective. You will continue to see that from millennials. You'll continue to see that with women as well. 
So I think what we learned is that -- since then is that there is a broader market for our products than we initially thought, number one. Number two, you always have to keep innovating. And you have to innovate on a regular cycle basis. You can't stand on your laurels. And I would say that we learned more from some of our trials and tribulations with Costco than we did from the Card Act"

For the purposes of our accounting credit reserve, we did significantly weight a downside scenario. And I think that's in keeping with a little bit of a regulatory view where you have the Federal Reserve saying to all banks, ""We're still a little -- why don't we see a little bit more time pass before we free everyone to go back to returning to your appropriate capital levels?"" So we thought it was appropriate to be that conservative. But to be clear, the reserve that we have on the books implies that some -- that the steady recovery that we're in the midst of now just stops and things get worse. So if it doesn't, then you would expect to see more reserves. 
The only other comment I'd make is it's April 23. You're already at the point of the year where you really can't, for the most part, see write-offs go up significantly this year. Even if that stuff happens, the actual write-offs would go into next year. 
On OpEx, yes, we did have a $377 million gain on the really great portfolio we have of fintech investments. We have about 50 different companies we have holdings in. We do partnerships with those companies. It's really all about those partnerships. But market has been pretty frothy lately. So there was a big gain on a couple of those companies this quarter. There's also some offsets when the equity markets are frothy. Our deferred comp balances are a bit of an offset or a hedge almost to the equity investments. I would really think of it, Sanjay, mostly as a onetime sort of thing. This year, the reality is we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome. What we're focused on is to the extent we have good investment opportunities, you will see us use the financial strength that we have right now to pursue those opportunities because we are laser-focused and increasingly confident of the aspiration we have for 2022."

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. Early this morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say that our overall core business performance is",1574,"Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. 
Early this morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say that our overall core business performance is slightly better than our expectations, with credit performance continuing to be best-in-class, and we're especially encouraged about the progress we're making toward our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022.  
As I discussed in January, we're looking at 2021 as a transition year, where our focus is on investing to rebuild growth momentum by firing up our core business, scaling next-horizon opportunities, while continuing to retain financial flexibility. And while I feel good about our results for the quarter, what I feel really good about is the progress we're making to rebuild momentum.  
When we talk about firing up the core, we're looking for meaningful progress in 4 areas: spending volumes coming back to pre-pandemic levels; bringing new customers into the franchise; retaining and deepening relationships with our current customers; and signing up additional merchants. We're making good progress in all these areas.  
Overall spending on American Express Cards in Q1 continued the sequential improvements we saw through the last 2 quarters of 2020. U.S. volumes exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and spending in March from U.S. consumer and small- and medium-sized enterprise customers was higher than March 2019 levels. Non-U.S. volume lagged a bit due to renewed lockdowns in certain international countries.  
Excluding travel and entertainment categories, spending on our cards in Q1 was up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019 levels. This marked the third straight quarter of positive growth. And although the T&E volumes were significantly lower in the first quarter versus last year, we've seen a steady sequential upward trend in monthly T&E spending and a noticeable improvement in recent weeks, particularly in the U.S., as the vaccine rollout accelerated. 
These trends indicate that the pent-up demand for consumer travel we've been talking about is real, and it increases our confidence that the domestic -- that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover as the year progresses.  
In terms of bringing new customers into the franchise, card acquisitions are also gaining momentum and were up sequentially in the quarter globally. In fact, new accounts acquired on key premium U.S. consumer and small business products were above 2019 levels and exceeded the prior quarters. Initial spending on these new cards is strong, and the average FICO scores of these new U.S. consumer and small business card members are higher than those acquired pre-pandemic.  
In addition, card acquisitions in some of our largest travel co-brand portfolios have accelerated since the fourth quarter, an important indicator that travel remains an attractive category for consumers over the long term.  
Another indicator of building momentum in our core business is retaining and increasing engagement with existing card members. We have a good story to tell here as well. Card Member attrition on our proprietary products, which also includes our co-brands, continues to be lower than in the previous years, and customer satisfaction levels remain higher than pre-COVID levels. The additional value we provided on several of our premium products helped drive Card Member loyalty and spending in 2020 and, as we believe, has been sustained into this year. 
For example, 95% of U.S. Platinum Card members who took advantage of the streaming credits and 88% who use wireless credits offered last year are continuing to spend in these categories months later. We're also seeing good engagement on the new offers we rolled out earlier in the first quarter for Platinum Card members, which includes statement credits with PayPal and other select merchants. The uptake on these offers are in line with the wireless and streaming offers we announced last year.  
Overall, Card Member engagement with our digital channels and capabilities is at an all-time high, in most areas. For example, over 88% of our U.S. Card Members are making their payments digitally, and 87% use our website or app for self-service. The number of Amex Offers redeemed in Q1 increased fivefold versus last year's first quarter, topping 5.3 million redemptions.  
Finally, we continue to see strong adoption of Pay It Plan It, our buy now pay later feature, after we recently expanded the capability to all U.S. consumer cards. Since launching Pay It Plan It, card members have created over 6 million plans, totaling over $5 billion of accounts receivable.  
Another key driver momentum is expanding merchant coverage. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress growing merchant coverage internationally, while maintaining our coverage levels in the U.S. When it comes to building momentum, we aren't just focused on the near term. We're also focused on scaling next-horizon opportunities that will drive growth over the longer term.  
China represents an exciting opportunity in this regard. As you know, developing our card processing network in Mainland China has been a priority for us, and we're pleased with our progress. Since getting the green light to start processing payments in China 8 months ago, we have reached mobile wallet parity coverage through our partnerships with China's major mobile wallet providers. And to date, we have added over 14 million merchants to the network at the point of sale with more to come. 
A key enabler of our coverage growth in China is the progress we're making to modernize our network, particularly in adding the capability to process debit transactions globally, which is an essential need for customers in China and helps us prepare for potential additional debit applications elsewhere. We remain focused on scaling our China business by acquiring card members through the relationships we've established with 16 issuing partners, and I look forward to sharing more highlights of our progress over the course of the year.  
In our commercial business, our growth has been and will continue to be driven primarily by small- and medium-sized enterprises. A key element of our longer-term growth strategy for SME franchise is to deepen our relationships with current customers and attract new ones by offering a range of supplier payment and cash flow management solutions, both on and beyond the card, giving business owners more tools to help them manage their businesses. 
Kabbage is one example of how we plan to bring this strategy to life. We've been focused on integrating Kabbage's digital capabilities into our business. And in Q1, we began the rollout of the Kabbage platform, which includes a business checking account and working capital solutions to our small business customers.  
In our consumer business, Resy, our online dining platform, helps drive bookings and spending at restaurants, which is a top category for our Card Members. When a pandemic hit, Resy quickly pivoted its value proposition for restaurant owners to help them expand their offerings and find new ways to attract customers, including enabling takeout, meal kits, family meals and virtual events. 
Resy also provided a number of special offers for Amex card members. As a result, over the past year, Resy has seen significant growth in engagement for both consumers and restaurants. In fact, we've seen a number of reservations booked on the platform more than doubled since December, and Amex card members who use Resy are some of our highest spending and most profitable customers.  
Those are just some of the examples of our progress in rebuilding our growth momentum, both in our core business and with next-horizon opportunities. Importantly, as we've increased our investments in both categories, we've also been focused on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We resumed share repurchases this quarter, and our capital ratios continue to be well above our targets.  
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to share some thoughts on where I see things heading in the near term. As I sit here a little over a year since the global COVID pandemic started, I'm optimistic that the hopeful signs we're seeing as vaccine distribution accelerates will continue and get stronger as we move through the year. 
Of course, we're still cautiously keeping an eye on the progression of the virus and its impact on local lockdowns and cross-border travel restrictions in certain areas. But there are clear indicators that the economy is improving, particularly in the U.S., and I believe this will translate into continued steady improvements for American Express.  
Given all of this, we remain firmly committed to executing on our 2020 investment strategy for a building growth momentum for the longer term. As I said last quarter, we're not focused on achieving a particular EPS target this year. Instead, we're focused on achieving our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on our financial growth algorithm going forward. 
I'm encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2021, which makes me even more confident in our roadmap for achieving our 2022 aspiration. I'm particularly proud of our colleagues who have remained nimble and focused through the uncertainties of the past year. Their dedication and hard work, along with the flexibility of our business model, the loyalty of our customer base, the strength of our partnerships and the value of our brand make me feel very good about the future.  
Jeff will now walk you through our results, and we will take questions after that."

As I've said since the beginning of t",2807,"Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect good progress towards the aspirations we have for 2022 that Steve just outlined.  
As I've said since the beginning of the pandemic last year, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends, along with, this year, the marketing investments we are making to rebuild growth momentum. I'll spend most of my time this morning on these topics. But first, looking at the summary financials on Slide 3. 
When you consider year-over-year results, last year's first quarter included 2 months of pre-pandemic results. And so as you would expect, first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. But in contrast, while we don't typically look at monthly results, were you to look at our revenues in just the month of March, you'd see that they were up 7% year-over-year.  
Our first quarter net income was $2.2 billion, and earnings per share was $2.74. Included in these results is a $1.05 billion credit reserve release due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and continued strong credit performance.  
So now let's get into the first key driver of our performance volumes, beginning with a few comments on some nomenclature changes we have made to our volume reporting. Thinking ahead on how we expect our card processing network in Mainland China to grow in the coming quarters and years, we have renamed what we previously called GNS billed business as processed volumes because our business model in China is unique and different from what we do with our GNS partners in other regions. 
We have also changed what we previously referred to as proprietary billed business to just billed business and renamed what we used to call our overall volumes from billed business to network volumes. You will see we've recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release as well as on appendix, Slide 27.  
So with these changes in mind, moving on to our volume performance on Slide 4, we saw continued recovery across all of our volumes in the first quarter, with total network and billed business volumes down 8% and 9%, respectively, and processed volumes down only 1%, all on an FX-adjusted basis.  
Getting into the details of our billed business growth, which you will see several views of on Slides 5 through 10, we've shown first quarter trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 in order to provide a clearer picture of how spending is recovering, as we begin to lap the onset of the pandemic in March of last year. I'd also note that the trends we've seen in the first 2 weeks of April are a continuation of the trends we saw exiting the first quarter that I'll focus on this morning.  
In addition, it remains important to look at spending on travel and entertainment categories separately from spending in other categories, which we will now be calling goods and services spending, given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these 2 very different categories. 
Overall, there are a few key points I'd suggest as the takeaways on volumes from all of these slides. First, there are clear signs of volume momentum that we feel good about. As you can see on Slide 5, our overall billed business volume growth continued to recover steadily throughout the months of the first quarter, with the reopening of the economy and rollout of the vaccines progressing well in the U.S. and certain other geographies. 
Spending on goods and services, which represents the vast majority or 86% of our volumes, exceeded our expectations, growing 6% year-over-year and up 11% versus 2019 in the quarter and up 15% in the month of March.  
Spending on travel and entertainment also showed sequential improvement given the progress on the medical front in the U.S., further reinforcing our view that consumer and small business travel will recover over time.
Second, the growth in goods and services spending has continued to improve steadily in both our consumer and commercial businesses. In consumer as shown on Slide 6, we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, which was up 23% year-over-year this quarter, even as the recovery of offline spending accelerated, driving goods and services volumes up 7% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019.  
In commercial, as you can see on Slide 7, SME spending remains the most resilient across our customer types, supported by continued growth in B2B spending, which drove overall commercial spend on goods and services up 5% year-over-year and up 8% versus 2019 in the first quarter.  
Third, we are seeing a faster pace of spending recovery in the U.S. versus other regions. As shown on Slide 8, the total volumes from our U.S. consumer and SME customers are recovering faster than other customer types and were up 1% versus 2019 levels in the month of March, even with the continued drag of T&E spend not yet fully recovering.  
International consumer and SME spending, on the other hand, is recovering more slowly due to renewed restrictions in key international geographies and the fact that, historically, we tend to have more travel-related spending in our international regions. 
And large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily travel and entertainment, continued to be down the most during the first quarter, as we expected, since this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.  
Fourth, T&E spending, though still down significantly, did improve steadily across all categories throughout the months of the first quarter, and consumer T&E continued to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We expect this trend to continue given the pent-up demand to travel that we see in our consumer base and the positive early signs of domestic travel recovery that we see in the U.S. as the vaccine rollout progresses.  
So to sum up on spending volumes, we feel good about the steady growth we are seeing in goods and services spending, and we expect it to continue to grow throughout 2021. On T&E spending, the trends we've seen in the first quarter are encouraging and give us more confidence in our current assumption that by Q4, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of its Q4 2019 levels, led by recovery in U.S. consumer domestic travel.  
Turning next to the other key volume driver, receivable and loan balances on Slide 11. Receivable balances were down 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with spending volumes. Loan balances, however, were down 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, more than spending volumes, as we continued to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which relates to the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in just a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes.  
So turning next to our second key driver, credit and provision on Slides 12 through 16. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. We continue to see extremely strong credit performance, with card member loans and receivables write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 53% and 82% year-over-year, respectively, as you can see on Slide 12. 
We attribute this performance to our robust risk management practices, the premium nature of our customer base as well as the unprecedented level of government stimulants and forbearance programs. Clearly, macroeconomic forecasts have improved over the last 90 days, as you can see on Slide 13. However, we still have 2 very different macroeconomic forecast scenarios, and we continued to put significant weight on the downside scenario in the modeling we did to calculate our first quarter credit reserves.  
The impact of the improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models, coupled with the sequential decline in loan and receivables balances and our strong credit performance, led us to release $1.05 billion of reserves. This reserve release and our extremely low write-offs drove a provision expense benefit of $675 million in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 14. 
That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $2.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on Slide 15. In the coming quarters, we will see how the Card Members exiting our financial relief programs will perform. That will be an important milestone for us, though I would observe that all of the early exit performance indicators have looked quite strong.  
There also continues to be some uncertainty in the medical environment and the vaccine rollout, and we'll have to see how that plays out. And so we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. Slide 16 shows you this, and that we ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of reserves, representing 6.4% of our loan balances and 0.5% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively.  
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to rebuild growth momentum on Slide 17. We invested $1 billion in marketing in the first quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisitions, while maintaining our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.1 million new cards in the first quarter, up around 20% sequentially. 
Importantly, the number of new accounts we acquired on our premium fee-based products was up 35% versus Q4, with acquisition volumes on many of our premium U.S. consumer and small business products exceeding 2019 levels. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. 
As a result, we continued to expect to spend a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this full year. Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities and the pace at which we wind down our value-injection efforts, as our customers begin again to experience the full benefits of our existing value propositions.  
So what do our 3 key drivers mean for our financial performance this quarter? As I said earlier, year-over-year revenues on Slides 18 and 19 are impacted by the prior year quarter, including 2 pre-pandemic months. So first quarter revenues were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis primarily driven by volume declines, impacting net discount revenue and net interest income, as well as declines in travel-related revenues and delinquencies, impacting other commissions and fees and other revenues.  
Net card fees, however, grew 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 20, demonstrating the impact of the strong continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. Looking forward, I expect the growth rate of net card fees will slow for a few more quarters driven by our decision last year to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the beginning of the pandemic. Given the renewed momentum, we are now beginning to see in new card acquisitions, I would expect net card fee growth to then reaccelerate.  
Moving on to net interest income on Slide 21. You see that net interest income declined 22% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. While the primary driver of this is the decline in loan volumes, net interest yield on our Card Member loans also decreased 60 basis points due to the higher paydown rates from revolving Card Members on our credit card products. Looking forward, I expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes.  
Volumes are also the primary driver of the discount revenue trends you see on Slide 22. As expected, though, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business. The average discount rate declined 8 basis points year-over-year driven by the greater declines we saw in T&E spending where we, on average, earn higher discount rates. 
The year-over-year erosion in the first quarter is a bit less than in Q4 due to the recovery in T&E spending throughout the quarter that I spoke about earlier. Looking forward, we still expect that if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned previously, you'd probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you could see full year revenue growth, but somewhat lower or higher than that 9% or 10%.  
Moving on to expenses. We are continuing to break out on Slide 23 our variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 10% year-over-year. Relative to the past few quarters, we did experience higher usage of travel-related benefits and rewards, which we see as a clear sign of the pent-up demand we've been talking about. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the next few quarters.  
Moving on to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio, partially offset by some higher deferred and other compensation expenses. In 2021, we still expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses, while also investing to rebuild growth momentum.  
Turning next to capital and liquidity. On Slide 23, our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 14.8% in the first quarter, our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the quarter at $61.5 billion, far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year.  
We resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.3 million shares, and we remain committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. In Q2, we plan to repurchase shares up to the maximum amount permitted under the Fed authorized capacity of around $900 million. Looking forward, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet.  
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in Q1 might mean for the future. In January, I laid out 2 scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happened with credit reserves. 
Our original scenario 1, or low scenario, assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year, and that we would not release any credit reserves in the year. Now 3 months into the year, the macro outlook has improved, and credit performance has remained very strong, so we've already released $1.05 billion of reserves. This still leaves us, however, with a lot of credit reserves we've built due to economic uncertainty.  
So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 25 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical and economic environment does not improve further and, that we, therefore, do not release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $6 per share.  
Our updated scenario 2 in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 9% to 10% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as $7.50.  
More importantly, in either scenario, as I said earlier, our marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see, not by a focus on any specific EPS outcome for 2021. What we are focused on is managing the company to rebuild growth momentum and achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations that we had for 2020 in 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm beyond 2022.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

So in 2022, we're really assuming, Don, that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it was pre pandemic, small business lagging that a bit, and then large and global corporation travel still being well below its 2019 levels.  
The other comment I would make about 2022 is domestic travel in the U.S. and around the globe will be the fuel that gets us to that level. We would still expect cross-border travel to be a little weaker next year than it was in 2019 just given the likely lingering number of cross-border restrictions that you've seen. 
As of how we feel about our Q4 assumption, look, we had a clear inflection point this quarter in the U.S., and so we feel good. But Steve, you may want to add a few."

No, I think that those -- the assumptions that Jeff just went through are exactly the assumptions we have in our calculus here. But I think when you look at this quarter and you look at the trends that we're seeing, I mean, we're seeing an increase in bookings, right? 
So we're seeing our travel bookings are up 50% over the -- this quarter up 50% over Q4 '20. When you look at -- and we look at this really carefully. When you look at February versus March, in March now, we were 50% of 2019 bookings, and that was 19%. So we have 31% in February and then went to 50%. So we feel really good about that.
When we also start to really dig into the data, we start to look at sort of cohorts of spending, and we're seeing people that are younger are getting back at a much higher level. Their overall T&E spending is probably about 85% to 90% and almost 100% back to where they were in 2019 in restaurants. 
And then when we look at older people, as they get vaccinated, we're seeing sequential growth month-on-month as we look at their growth. And so if you look at just people over 45, you're seeing an 11% increase in their overall T&E spending month-to-month. We -- that's only going to get better for us as we move along.  
And the last thing that gives us a lot of great hope is redemptions, is MR redemptions. I mean, when you go back and look at sort of MR redemptions that we had, our MR point redemptions in the fourth quarter for Air was like 30%, and it's up to 54%. 
So we are doing some good things here, and our customers are doing some good things. And we'll continue to make sure that we're retaining these customers because they're going to spend. And as Jeff said, our co-brand cards are doing quite well as well. So all of that leads to, again, in an environment that continues to improve, us having a lot of confidence in hitting our 2020 plan in 2022 ."

What we are incredibly focused on is that 2022 aspiration, which we are really growing in confidence about.  
All that said, if you -- if I take it back to January, the then $5 low scenario assumed that the world would be so tough this year that you would not end up releasing any credit reserves. So we just released $1.05 billion of reserves. That's about $1. That takes you from $5 to $6. So your $6 assumes, once again, the world from here is suddenly going to get really tough, and you're not going to release any more reserves. At the high end, yes, we had assumed you release some modest level of reserves, which is why the high end only went up from $7 to $7.50.  
So that's how we thought about it. I just want to close, though, by again emphasizing, we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome this year. We're incredibly focused on what we're trying to achieve for 2022."

And you're starting to see -- look, I mean, Jeff and I are in h",679,"All right. So when you think about corporate, the first thing people have to do is get back into the offices, right, because If people are back into the offices, there's nowhere to travel to. And you're starting to see -- look, I mean, Jeff and I are in here today with 80 of our closest friends in a building that has about 5,000 people. And we've said we're not going to have people really come back until after Labor Day. You're seeing other companies sort of gradually get back into it. So I think, the step 1.  
First step is let's get people back into the office, and then companies are going to say, ""Okay. How comfortable I am having visitors into the building?"" And my anticipation is most companies will start opening -- start the process of reopening in the United States now, July through sort of September, and get to some capacity level. I mean -- and you guys have your own situations yourselves, where you're -- most of you are probably sitting at home today.  
So I think what's going to happen is it's going to be slow, which is why we really haven't assumed a lot of corporate T&E coming back and a lot of travel coming back. Having said that, corporate T&E takes many forms. We do have salespeople that are on -- out and on the road and calling on accounts. And there's car rental and there's gas, and they're still staying at hotels and restaurants. And so I think for a segment of it, and I think when you look at a segment of our, let's call them, industrial corporate -- T&E corporate customers, they have people that are going to plants and visiting -- making customer calls and so forth. 
I think that, eventually, what will happen is investment banks and consultants are going to want to go out and meet with their clients again. There's been a lot of deals that have been done, a lot of relationships that have been built, but there's nothing like in person. I just think it will take a bit of time.  
And look, there's also -- there's that substitution. It's a substitution of WebEx and Zoom and what have you, which is why we've been talking 2023 before it gets back to 2019 levels. And I think with that assumption, we feel good about hitting that 2020 aspiration in 2022. 
So when you think about what goes into our assumption for 2022, you've got a slower return of international, you've got a much lower return of corporate, and yet we're saying we'll be at 2020 levels.  
And so is there upside from a consumer perspective on travel? I think that all depends on the rollout of the vaccine, governments opening up their borders and things like that. I think from a domestic travel perspective, pent-up -- there's pent-up demand. In talking to Ed Bastian and talking to Chris Nassetta, they're seeing a lot of bookings out front. I just went through some of our travel data.  
So as we go through this, I think what's going to be the key thing to watch for is how much does international travel come back from a consumer, and we're assuming that sort of now in the second half of 2022, okay, not in -- not really this year. 
And I think the other thing you're seeing, Mark, is you're seeing a divergence. I mean, you see what's going on in India right now. There's a lot of countries that are having different results and different situations as it relates to the vaccine. But one thing is inarguable. The more vaccine rollout, the more people feel confident. The more people feel confident, the more they'll get out and spend. 
And that's why I think when you look at sort of the -- towards the end of the second quarter into third quarter in the summer, you're going to see people hitting the road, you're going to see people hitting the skies, especially in the U.S."

We're seeing co-brand cards come back. I mean, we talked about 90% more Delta cards acquired in this quarter than in the previous quarter, and we're seeing a higher-level customer. I mentioned that in my remarks. The FICO is a lot higher, and we're seeing good spending.

For example, how concerned are you guys about the risk that the value proposition associated with the airline lounges may not be as great post-COVID? And how confident are you that you'll be able to identify sustainable cost-effective alternatives to maintain the overall value proposition across your different products to the extent that we can't just go back to the old -- sort of the older pre-pandemic offerings that you guys had?"

And so we'll talk more as we refresh those products, and we'll give you a little",481,"Yes. So a couple of points. So look, our strategy for the last 3 years has been to refresh our products on an ongoing basis, ongoing basis anywhere from sort of 3 to 4 years. And so we'll talk more as we refresh those products, and we'll give you a little bit more color on that. 
I take the opposite view on sort of the travel value propositions. I think they're actually going to be even stronger at this point. I think that people are going to want to have the safety and security of our lounges. We're opening up more lounges. We're not backing away from these lounges. In fact, we've opened up numerous lounges during the pandemic, and they've turned into a little bit more of an oasis for people where, they know, with our brand, our security and our reputation, we're going to take as good care of people in our lounges as possible. 
And I think the other thing that there's a lot of questions we got at this time last year was, ""Geez. What's the future of your travel co-brand cards?"" And when we look at the month of March, and we look at sort of Delta and we look at Hilton as just 2 examples, they're at 2019 spending levels overall and because people have been accumulating points and people want status. And as I've said numerous times on these calls, status is probably even going to be more important going forward. 
So what we will continue to do is we're not going to walk away from our travel value propositions. If anything, I've been more encouraged that we did the right things, and we'll continue to add though. I mean, I think if you look at our history over the last 3 years or so, 3.5 years, we've kept our core value proposition and continued to add. 
And during the pandemic, I talked about the results we had with wireless and the results we had with streaming. We got customers who were not using our card for those things. By putting some value in, we're now 4 months after the value and they're still spending. 
And we're doing the same thing. Right now, we've got a PayPal Credit for our Platinum cardholders, and we're picking up more Card Members that didn't use PayPal. And as I've talked about PayPal and I've talked about some of the other fintech Square and Stripe and so forth, they've actually not only helped us get more coverage, but have helped us in ways to deliver more value to our Card Members. 
So we feel good about our card -- our value propositions. We feel good about the travel value propositions that are in our products, but we will continue to expand and evolve our value propositions as we have over time. We're not walking away from that strategy."

If there are not attractive opportunities, we will not spend it. If there are attractive opportunities, we will spend more if they're there mainly because we're focused on building that momentum.

I mean -- so our Corporate Card is predominantly, it's like 60% travel and entertainment, whereas our SME card is like 80% goods and services. They use the card to run their business. 
And as we've talked about travel coming back, it comes back in layers. It comes back with consumer, then it's SME and then it's large and corporate. So it is a very different business and -- which is why we went and acquired Kabbage to have a digital front for these SMEs where they can not only get their card spending done, but also get working capital loans, have a transaction banking account, have merchant financing loan, have short-term loans and things like that because small businesses -- small and midsized businesses use this card to really help to run their businesses, which is a fundamental difference between how corporations use the card, which is to support T&E. And obviously, there's B2B opportunities with large corporates, but -- that's why small business has come back. 
What our small businesses have done, I think, even better than what you might have thought is, is the dispersion that we have across the small business arenas, and I've said this many times. When people think about small businesses, they tend to think about the small retail shop, what they tend to think about is small restaurant. 
The reality is a lot of them didn't do so well during this time. We don't have a tremendous amount of our small business base there. It is a very diverse base. And when you think about professional services, you think about cooling and plumbing and electric and all those things, our base is very wide, and that has helped us because some small business segments during this time have just been through the roof. Others have been hit really hard, and others have businesses -- have maintained as they were before the pandemic."

So nothing really to announce here, but I think it's important that you understand the capabilities that we're building as well, and we're building these capabilities from a global perspective so that we have it.

One of the responses we saw from you is that you moved on to your front foot in terms of targeting millennials for card acquisition. I'm curious, as we sort of enter this new period of expansion and all of your competitors are talking about growth, what are the lessons you learned last cycle? And either tactically or strategically, how will you respond?"

I think our competitors got into this more after the financial crisis when they really looked at this and said, ""This was a very attractive business.""
The reality is the Card Act had a lot less impact on us because, remember, 80% of our revenues are not from interest. And the fact that interest rates, especially on prior balances, were now controlled, really, had less impact on us than it did at our competitors. Our competitors wound up just growing their overall business. And one of the first things they did is hire a lot of people from American Express to do that. 
But, look, I think that the lessons that we've learned over time -- and look, I've always said this, we welcome competition. The lessons that we learned over time is you need to continue to focus in on what your customer needs are and how your customer is changing and evolving. And this is why, when I took over, one of the first things I said is we're going to go to a strategy of refreshing our products on a real ongoing basis. You cannot have your Green Card sit out there for 30 years and think it's still as relevant 30 years ago as it is today. 
Millennials was really not as much a Card Act. Millennials was us opening our eyes to the fact that our value proposition had a much broader appeal, and I think that we really started to communicate that. And look -- and I've said this publicly before, I think your company there did a great job of really highlighting premium cards. I'm talking about JPMorgan, and Gordon and his team did a fantastic job of highlighting premium cards to millennials, and our value proposition played remarkably well there. And as I just said, 60% of our cards that we just acquired are millennials. 
I think we had to expand our aperture, and we did that. We expanded that aperture, and we realized that the value proposition that we had could have a wider audience and could have a wider target, and we've done that, and we will continue to do that. You will continue to see that from a multicultural perspective. You will continue to see that from millennials. You'll continue to see that with women as well. 
So I think what we learned is that -- since then is that there is a broader market for our products than we initially thought, number one. Number two, you always have to keep innovating, and you have to innovate on a regular cycle basis. You can't stand on your laurels. And I would say that we learned more from some of our trials and tribulations with Costco than we did from the Card Act."

For the purposes of our accounting credit reserve, we did significantly weighed a downside scenario, and I think that's in keeping with a little bit of a regulatory view where you have the Federal Reserve saying to all banks, ""We're still a little. Why don't we see a little bit more time pass before we free everyone to go back to returning to your appropriate capital levels?"" 
So we thought it was appropriate to be that conservative. But to be clear, the reserve that we have on the books implies that some -- that steady recovery that we're in the midst of now just stops, and things get worse. So if it doesn't, then you would expect to see more reserves. 
The only other comment I'd make is it's April 23. You're already at the point of the year where you really can't, for the most part, see write-offs go up significantly this year. Even if that stuff happens, the actual write-offs would go into next year. 
On OpEx, yes, we did have a $377 million gain on the really great portfolio we have of fintech investments. We have about 50 different companies we have holdings in. We do partnerships with those companies. It's really all about those partnerships. But market has been pretty frothy lately, so there was a big gain on a couple of those companies this quarter. 
There's also some offsets when the equity markets are frothy. Our deferred comp balances are a bit of an offset or a hedge almost to the equity investments. I would really think of it, Sanjay, mostly as a onetime sort of thing. 
This year, the reality is we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome. What we're focused on is, to the extent we have good investment opportunities, you will see us use the financial strength that we have right now to pursue those opportunities because we are laser-focused and increasingly confident of the aspiration we have for 2022."

Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80. These results reflect an acceleration of the momentum we've seen in our core business and a strengthening macro environment. 
Our improving performance is a clear indication that the steps we've taken to manage the company through the pandemic and our investments to rebuild growth momentum are paying off. We're particularly pleased with the progress we're seeing in several key areas, including engaging and retaining our existing customers, acquiring new customers, continued excellent credit performance and an acceleration in spending. Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been investing in short-term value enhancements to several of our premium products, which has helped drive Card Member engagement and contributed to retention levels that remain higher than the last few years. 
We've also ramped up our acquisition engine over the past several quarters, and we're really pleased to see that overall acquisitions of proprietary cards, which include our co-brands, have continued to increase with 2.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. In fact, demand for our premium fee-based products accelerated this quarter, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold cards well above 2019 levels and exceeding prior quarters, contributing to the continued double-digit growth in net card fees. Early spending on these new accounts is strong. 
We're also pleased to see that acquisitions are increasing in many of our co-brand portfolios. For example, as Ed Bastian mentioned on Delta's earnings call last week, Delta co-brand acquisitions reached 90% of 2019 levels in Q2. 
Turning to credit. We continue to see excellent credit performance with both delinquency and write-off rates improving further and reaching near historic lows in the quarter. We're also seeing continued improvements in Card Member spending. Spending recovery accelerated in Q2 with overall billed business volumes growing 51% in the quarter on an FX-adjusted basis versus last year and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in June. Goods and services volumes continued to strengthen, increasing 16% globally on an FX-adjusted basis versus Q2 2019. Travel and entertainment spending also accelerated in the quarter, particularly in the U.S., where a growing percentage of the population is now fully vaccinated. In fact, we saw a surge in spending by U.S. Consumer Card Members across all T&E categories. with overall U.S. Consumer T&E spending reaching 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and continuing to grow into July. T&E spending outside the U.S. continues to recover more slowly due to the overall -- due to lower overall vaccination rates and government-imposed restrictions in some geographies. 
In our Consumer business, the largest contributor to spending growth in goods and services came from millennial and Gen Z customers, and they are also leading the recovery in T&E spending, with total spending up over 30% on an FX adjusted basis versus 2019 levels in Q2 for this age cohort. 
In our Commercial business, overall small and midsized enterprise volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q2, driven by continued strong growth globally in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019. While the T&E recovery also accelerated, with the fastest total growth coming from smaller sized businesses in the U.S. 
We're also seeing solid spending growth in key travel-related co-brand portfolios. Volumes on both Delta and Hilton co-brand cards increased by double digits versus pre-pandemic levels in the quarter, driven by the same trends of continued strong growth in goods and services spending and an acceleration in the recovery of T&E spend. In addition to investing in retention and acquisition activities as a customer-focused company led by innovation, a key part of our investment strategy is geared toward delivering a continuous stream of differentiated products, services and capabilities that provide additional value to our current customers and attract new ones to the franchise. We invest in innovation in a number of ways through inter development, acquisitions, co-brand relationships and partnerships with both digital startups and large well-known brands across a range of industries. 
A great example of our approach to innovation is our strategy for regularly refreshing our unique value propositions by leveraging our digital ecosystem and our diverse network of partners. On July 1, we marked the restart of this strategy with the launch of our new enhanced Platinum Card for consumers in the U.S. The American Express Platinum Card created the Premium card category nearly 40 years ago and has continued to define the category ever since. We intend to make sure it remains a competitive standard for many years to come. 
The reason for Platinum's success over the years, I believe, is twofold. First is our continual focus on knowing our customers and delivering value that meets their evolving needs and preferences. And second is our willingness to change our value propositions even as our products are at the peak of their performance. And that's the case with our most recent refresh. Despite just coming off our best quarter ever for U.S. Platinum account acquisitions, we introduced our new U.S. Consumer Platinum Card featuring a broader set of lifestyle benefits while doubling down on travel-related benefits. The new benefits are enabled by working with an expanded range of partners as well as the continued integration of our growing portfolio of digital assets such as Resy and LoungeBuddy. I would note that the last time we refreshed our U.S. Platinum Card, we doubled the customer base, bringing in a larger number of younger card members, and our intent with our current refresh is to attract an even broader pool of customers to the franchise. 
In developing the new Platinum card, we listened to our card members and gleaned insights from their spending behavior to determine what features and benefits would be most relevant for the way they live now. For example, some of the spending patterns on certain everyday goods and services categories that emerged during the pandemic, such as streaming services and personal fitness, have continued into the recovery. This led us to add a series of annual credits for digital entertainment services and Equinox club memberships or digital subscriptions to their on-demand app. Our Platinum Card Members have always cared a lot about travel and entertainment. And as our recent quarterly results demonstrate, our U.S.-based customers are eagerly returning to travel and in-person dining. So we added a series of new travel-related benefits to the refresh product on top of those Platinum Card already offers, including a significant expansion of our proprietary Centurion Lounge network and a new global dining access program powered by Resy, our online reservation platform that provides exclusive access to some of the world's best restaurants and premium dining experiences. 
The enhancements we've made to the U.S. Platinum Card represent a significant increase in value, which we believe will be very attractive to both current and new customers, even with an increase in its annual fee. As we have seen from previous refreshes, customers are willing to pay more for what they see as Platinum's unique value, and we believe it will be no different in this case. In fact, the very early indications are encouraging. Applications and acquisitions have outpaced our expectations in the first 2 weeks since the new Platinum Card became available. 
The U.S. Platinum refresh is just 1 example of how we're leveraging partnerships in our digital ecosystem to innovate and add differentiated value to our products and services. We'll be refreshing other products and rolling out new digital capabilities for both consumer and commercial customers throughout the remainder of the year and beyond. 
We're really excited about the new U.S. Platinum card and the potential that it and other innovations we have in the pipeline represent. And there are many other reasons why I feel very good about where we are at the halfway point in the year, including the progress we're making to rebuild momentum in our core business is accelerating and better than we expected at the beginning of the year. The improvements we're seeing across many of our key metrics are sign that our strategy for managing through the pandemic and investing in activities to rebuild our growth momentum is working. We're particularly pleased with the strength we're seeing in customer retention, new account acquisitions, credit performance and overall spending volumes, with goods and services volumes now well above pre-pandemic levels globally and travel and entertainment spending recovering faster than we expected, driven by significant improvement in the United States. 
Taking all of these factors together, we are increasingly optimistic that the strength we've seen in our core business through the first half will continue, particularly in the U.S., even as the pace of recovery remains uneven in different regions around the world. With this in mind, we remain committed to executing our investment strategy for growing our business over the long term. And based on current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Thank you."
92001,1671459900,2350376,"American Express Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives. Startin",2527,"Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives. 
Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion were up 31% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, as we lapped the trough of the billings and revenue declines that occurred during the most significant pandemic lockdowns in Q2 of last year. Our second quarter net income was $2.3 billion, and earnings per share was $2.08. These strong results were, of course, in part driven by an $866 million credit reserve release as we saw continued strong credit performance and some improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. 
Now as I turn to a more detailed look at our results, I'll again focus on what we see as the key drivers of our great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives: volumes, credit trends and the marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum. As we've said all year, 2021 itself is a transition year, positioning us for 2022 and beyond. 
So let's now get into the first key driver to watch as we measure our progress this year, volumes, which you will see several views of on Slides 3 through 9. You will note that we have shown second quarter volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, as we find this provides a clearer picture of how spending is recovering on the way to our 2022 financial objectives. And that clear picture on Slide 3 shows an acceleration in the pace of recovery across all of our volumes in the second quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes up around 50% year-over-year, as we lapped the trough of the billings declines from Q2 2020. 
Importantly, relative to 2019, total network volumes, billed business and processed volumes were all down just 2% on an FX-adjusted basis and surpassed pre-COVID levels for the month of June. 
The acceleration in billed business is being driven by both spending on goods and services, which was up 16% versus 2019, as you can see on Slide 4, and by a notable improvement in spending on travel and entertainment in the second quarter. Overall T&E spending reached nearly 70% of 2019 levels as we exited Q2. This is a level we originally expected we would not reach until the fourth quarter of this year. So to see it recovering more quickly than we had expected and without it coming at the cost of any slowing in the growth in goods and services spending is a positive indicator for us. 
Turning to Slide 5. You do see that the billed business volume recovery is being led by the U.S., which surpassed 2019 levels and was up 3% in the quarter. The recovery in total billed business volumes outside of the U.S. is weaker. Interestingly, though, you see on the top right of Slide 5 that the growth in goods and services spending has been strong in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spend is weaker outside the U.S. because historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions, and international T&E is recovering more slowly due to lower vaccination rates and continued government restrictions in certain geographies. 
Focusing in then on just our Consumer business on Slide 6, you see that overall spending was 4% above 2019 levels in the quarter, as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 18% versus 2019. And we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic, even as offline spending recovered to pre-pandemic levels. 
In our commercial business, as you can see on Slide 7, global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spend up 6% versus 2019 for the quarter. This performance was supported by continued growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% versus 2019. 
In contrast, on Slide 8, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We have said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. 
Finally, putting all customer types G&A spending together on Slide 9, you do see improvement across the board in the second quarter, with total T&E spending reaching nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the month of June. As I said earlier, this recovery has been faster than we expected, led by a sharp recovery in U.S. consumer T&E spending, which reached 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and has continued to grow in July. 
Looking ahead, we now assume that overall T&E spending globally will have recovered to around 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021. We also expect continued steady growth in goods and services spending for the remaining 2021. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes. 
Moving to our other volume metric, receivable and loan balances on Slide 10, you'll see a slightly different set of charts here and in a few other places throughout this presentation, where we thought it would be helpful to show comparisons for the first and second quarter relative to both 2020 and 2019 to help with better rate of recovery. Loan balances began to slowly recover in the second quarter and were up 7% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Relative to 2019, though, loan balances remained down 11%, 11% more than spending volumes. We continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes. 
This leads then to the second key driver to watch this year, credit and provision, on Slides 11 through 14. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows, although we would expect loss rates to slowly return to more normal levels eventually. Given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off rates anytime this year. 
This strong credit performance, combined with some improvement in our macroeconomic outlook, drove a $606 million provision expense benefit in the second quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release, as shown on Slide 12. That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $1.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on Slide 13. We are closely monitoring how the Card Members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, and early performance of recent exits has looked quite strong. But we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off, and there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment around the world, including in the U.S. So we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. 
As you see on Slide 14, we ended the second quarter with $4 billion of reserves, representing 5% of loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. 
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to build long-term growth momentum, on Slide 15. We invested $1.3 billion in marketing in the second quarter as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while maintaining some of our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.4 million new cards, up around 20% sequentially. More importantly than just the total number of cards, we've seen great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products up 30% versus the prior quarter and up almost 4x year-over-year. As Steve mentioned, as some great examples, acquisitions of new U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold cards all reached well above 2019 levels this quarter. Based on the momentum we've seen in the first half of this year, we would now expect to see around $5 billion in marketing spend this year. Ultimately, though, our marketing levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities we see and the pace at which we finished winding down our value-injection efforts in the remainder of the year. 
So what does all this mean for revenues on Slide 16? Total revenues were up 33% year-over-year in the second quarter, and we had double-digit growth in almost every 1 of our revenue lines, except for net interest income, which only accounts for 18% of our revenues. 
Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues. 
Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, led the recovery, though, as it was up 56% on an FX-adjusted basis year-over-year, as shown on Slide 17. This recovery is primarily driven by the strong growth in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Importantly, these revenues have been our most resilient revenue line throughout the pandemic, as you can see on Slide 18. They are now $300 million or 30% higher than they were back in the second quarter of 2019, demonstrating the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. 
The 1 revenue line showing a slower recovery is net interest income on Slide 19, which, as I mentioned, accounts for only 18% of our revenues. For us, though, the driver here is the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. Looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. 
So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q2, as you can see on Slide 20. While revenues remain 6% below pre-pandemic levels on an FX adjusted basis, they were up 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, with the momentum in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first half of the year and our updated assumption that we now expect overall T&E to recover to 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of the year, full year revenue growth could be around 12% to 14%, assuming current trends continue. 
Moving on to expenses. We're continuing to break out, on Slide 21, our variable customer engagement expenses, which moved with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were up 85% year-over-year, driven by higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio. In 2021, full year, given the year-to-date gains we've seen in our equity investment portfolio, I'd now expect our full year OpEx to be a bit below the $11.5 billion we originally expected, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to build growth momentum in our business. 
Turning next to capital on Slide 22. Our capital position remains tremendously strong. Our Q2 CET1 ratio of 14.2% remains far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year and growth in our capital base from earnings that have exceeded distributions. We returned $1.3 billion in total to shareholders this quarter, including common stock repurchases of $908 million and $346 million in common stock dividends. Looking forward, we remain committed to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. Given the Federal Reserve's latest guidance, we plan to increase the pace of share repurchases to migrate towards our CET1 ratio target over the next few quarters. 
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first half of the year might mean for the future. In January and again in April, I laid out 2 scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happens with credit reserves. As a reminder, our scenario 1 [ or ] low scenario assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the subsequent quarters. Now halfway into the year, the macro outlook has improved somewhat, and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. So we've already released $1.9 billion of reserves. That still leaves us, however, with a reserve ratio that is above pre-pandemic levels due to the remaining uncertainties. 
So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 23 assumes that this uncertainty persists; that the medical environment and economic outlook worsens; and that we, therefore, don't release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of an 80% overall T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $7.50 per share. 
Our updated scenario 2, in contrast, assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 12% to 14% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $8.75. 
More important, though, than these 2021 numbers is our focus on managing the company to further build growth momentum. Our progress this quarter around our key drivers, volumes, credit performance and marketing was very strong, and this gives us confidence that our strategies are working. Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability in 2022 to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had before the pandemic for 2020 of $8.85 to $9.25. And we are confident in our ability to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

Should we assume that as T&E comes back, those value injections flow?"

On value injection, Sanjay, certainly, with what we're seeing in the world now, we would expect that to continue to go down each quarter and be completely gone by the end of the year. And so that's one of the reasons. As you think about 2022, our overall marketing line dollars should be down a little bit in 2022 from 2021 because value injection will be at 0. But Steve, you probably want to talk a little bit about the demand issues."
92001,1671459900,2350376,"American Express Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Yes. So Sanjay, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn't acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we're still ramping up, and we're still not at overall levels",453,"Yes. So Sanjay, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn't acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we're still ramping up, and we're still not at overall levels of acquisition that we want to be at. And the reason for that is you've got international, which is not opened up. And so acquisition levels from an international perspective, both from an SME side of it, from a consumer side of it, is not there. You've got corporate card acquisition. Not a lot of companies are adding a lot of people. And so you don't have that. 
So when you really start to dig into this, a lot of this is really the pent-up demand. And so just take a look at what we're looking at. And we look at Hilton co-brand cards and we look at Delta co-brand cards, we continue to see them sequentially month-over-month add more volume. And what you're now seeing is you're seeing volume being added in T&E, but you are seeing sustained volume growth in goods and services. And so we think we've done a really good job with the value injection in pivoting sort of people how they thought about these cards. 
And so looking back years from now, we may find that one of the sort of the bright spots of this for us from a spending perspective is people found other ways to use their cards, and we actually improved our goods and services mix. So I think you're seeing that pent-up demand coming from existing cardholders. And yet, we're not back to travel levels in any way, shape or form. 
The other thing, if you start to sort of dig into our spending by sort of age group, we mentioned that our millennial spending is up 30% over 2019. Well, then you can just take that and you go to the boomers and you go to our next level of people, and that spending is still building up. So we believe there's still a lot of spending within our existing base. 
You look at corporate spending, which is about half of what it was. Small Business, while doing very well from a goods and services perspective is still challenged from a T&E perspective. And so we believe that a lot of the growth that we've had has come from the existing base, and I think there's more to come from that existing base. And as we get more and more Card Members on board, you're going to see more spending there as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color."

So if you think about -- let's go back to why. So why did we do the value injection? So we did the value injection to make sure that the value propositions that were challenged at the time, which were predominantly travel-based value propositions, would no -- people wouldn't look at it and say, ""I'm not getting value from the card."" And that was -- I think that we'll look back on that as a very important decision because what it said to our customers is that, ""Look, we know that you are -- you bought the product for a specific reason. You cannot use that product to -- we always talk about experiences and access, and you can't get that."" And so what we did was, and I give our teams and our marketing teams a tremendous amount of credit here, is we look for categories that people were going to really double down on in streaming services, wireless services, more shipping services even dining on some of our co-brand cards, and we invested a lot of money in value injection. 
The other thing that we did is we also, at the top end on our Platinum and our Centurion, is put credits in for travel, okay, which is one of the reasons our -- I think our TLS bookings are now above 2019 levels in June. And we continue that at the beginning of the year because the beginning of the year, we were still unsure, but we changed the value injection. So on Platinum Card, we went to a PayPal credit. And that PayPal credit was to get more embedding within that ecosystem so that you have more cards on file. But our plan has been and always has been is that the value that we have in our products stands on its own. And once we got to the point where people could take advantage of, of the existing product, and this is predominantly more of a U.S. phenomenon at this particular point in time, you didn't need that value injection. 
And so then we get back to, okay, what did we learn? And then you look at the Platinum refresh. And if you look at the Platinum refresh, what does that have? Well, it has a wider variety of components to it in terms of streaming. It has digital credits, whether it's Sirius or Peacock or New York Times or what have you. And it also has another travel credit within there. And so we don't believe we need to rely on value injection at all. 
And so as you look at the high marketing going forward, we believe the value of the products will stand for themselves. Having said that, we're also going to go back on our quest to continue to refresh our product portfolio. And you're seeing that. You obviously just start it with the Platinum Card, and we're not going to stop at the Platinum card, but I'll stop at that comment at this point. 
And so when you look at the $5 billion in spending, what we made the decision this year is we weren't going to cap that spending. So at the beginning of the year, you're seeing a lot of value injection, but we also made decisions at the beginning to go in with more customer acquisition. And so we'll continue to do that, which will drive us closer to the $5 billion. 
But the bottom line on this is that our products were resilient through this. We propped them up a little bit. We learned a lot. And what we're seeing with our consumers right now is that they are utilizing these value propositions. And they're utilizing these value propositions with lounge visits, with bookings, by using the travel credits and all the benefits that come with Gold and Platinum. 
We talked a lot about Platinum, but the Gold Card, too, is another premium product that we have, and that has been positioned a lot more as a dining product. And that has taken off as restaurants, especially in the United States, have come back. So the short answer, I guess, is that we don't believe we need value injection anymore. We believe the value in the products will continue to sustain the spending."

I think you've got a situation in Europe. Look, look at Japan with the Olympics, right? I mean everybody is expecting spectators to be, that there's no spectators there. You've got Australia, which is still closed. You've got the U.K., which is battling the Delta variant. And so I don't know what's going to happen with international. 
Having said that, our billings continue to improve in international. People, much like they were in the U.S., are looking for ways to travel, whether that be car trips, whether that be more restaurant and so forth. And so I don't really expect international to come back this year and hopefully, at some point next year. But that's really all going to be driven by vaccination and the efficacy of vaccinations. 
And remember, the vaccines that are available in different -- in other countries are not the same vaccines that are available in the United States. And there's different efficacy on all different types of vaccines, whether that's AstraZeneca, which has like a 67% efficacy; or it's a Moderna or a Pfizer, which is up at 88%. And so what you're seeing in the U.K. now is vaccinating -- vaccinated people actually get COVID, not being hospitalized or dying, but still getting COVID. So I don't think we're going to see international come back this year. I think -- and it's not really in our -- we look at it as a tailwind for sort of 2022 and 2023 for us. 
As far as China goes, look, China is -- we're really pleased with what's going on in China. And part of the China story is continuing to build the network and continue to build the card base, and we continue month-over-month to build that network and to build that card base. And as we move into other quarters, we'll provide more insight into what's going on. But I'm not -- I wouldn't say you're going to expect China to be a material part of our revenue base or our earnings base in the near-term future, more medium to long term. But I'd also like to remind everybody of the model that we have in China. 
The model that we have in China is a network-based model. And a way to think about a network-based model is to think about that model much like Visa and MasterCard's normal model is. We're not taking card fees. We're not getting a discount rate. We're getting network fees, and that's the way that's working. But we are building China. We believe it will add more scale, not only for us, and more presence in China for both our card members at travel ad, but it will also add scale for us as people -- as Chinese Card Members travel outside of China and add more scale and add more volume to the overall network. So China will not be material in the near term."

The other thing to remember is that as we express our confidence in our ability to get to our financial objectives, we're really not counting on international T&E coming back in any meaningful way next year.

The first thing I want to -- so to clear",555,"So as we think about next year and now, look, we went from comments of our aspiration was to be in the range to comments today of our anticipation is we'll be at the high end of the range. So what's driving that? 
The first thing I want to -- so to clearly state is, given that the recovery is uneven, we will continue to invest as we've been investing. And I think we have pulled back in our international card investment right now because it just doesn't make a lot of sense to continue to double down on that. And so we will continue, as we move into next year, to invest in not only our U.S. card acquisition, but international card acquisition, both small business and premium products. 
What are the assumptions behind sort of next year's getting to that high end? Well, look, we need consumer T&E to fully recover in 2022. And it's on a path to do that. So that is, I think, good. Obviously, like a reasonably healthy economy as well. And so all things being equal, things continue the way they are in the U.S., we feel really confident. 
What's not in those financial objectives is the following: a full recovery of net interest income. And you can look at our revenue, and you see where we are from a net interest income perspective. Corporate T&E is not factored in there, which we don't believe that will come back until 2023. Cross-border T&E, we believe, will continue to be challenged. And the comments that Jeff just made about international, while goods and services, we think will continue to grow. I think consumer T&E and corporate tenant international will continue to be challenged. So if that comes back, obviously, that provides upside and there would be tailwinds for 2022, but we'd more be counting on those as tailwinds for 2023. But again, it's really hard to predict. But that's a positive for us. 
The one thing I will have people keep in mind, though, is that we have -- we've had some big reserve releases. And as Jeff mentioned, when we talk about sort of 7 50 to 8 75, the 8 75 would anticipate some more releases, which would mean even bigger reserve releases. And so you have to grow over that. 
And part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary [ bill ] that we did last year. But I'd like to point out the other part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary job our credit team is doing. And so that's the other piece of it that we take into account. All that being said, we feel really good about how we're tracking for this year. And that's why we feel good about saying the high end of the range for 2022. And I just gave you a bunch of upside possibilities, and I just gave you the grow-over possibility as well, with the awesome notion is we're not going to get the marketing cutting -- we're not going to cut marketing to get there. We're not going to be at $5 billion because we will not have value injection there, but we will continue to invest in marketing because I think it has proven for us to be a great source of revenue growth."

In fact, I'd like to point out that the dollars that we have grown net card fees by about more than $300 million a quarter since 2019. Interestingly, kind of offsets the drop in net interest income, and we have a lot further to go. 
All that said, as most of you know, the accounting for card fees is a little complicated because we amortize people's card fee payments over 12 months after they pay them. And so that causes the trends to move slowly. So I've said through much of this year that I expected card fee growth, because we weren't acquiring a lot of new card members last year, to slow quite significantly in the back half of the year. 
I will tell you now that with the tremendous progress on bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise, I think you might see a little bit of slowing in the next couple of quarters before it reaccelerates next year. But boy, it's a lot less than we originally anticipated. 
The other thing I would remind people of is it's really bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise that drives that card fee growth. And in fact, when you think, Steve, about the Platinum refresh that you talked about, while we raised the fee for existing Card Members, that fee actually doesn't hit until their anniversary date next year. And then once it hits, we'll amortize it over 12 months. So it's a lovely long tailwind, but it's not going to be the driver of the next couple of quarters."

First, because of the effects of the pandemic, the variable customer engagement costs sort of have been flowing with revenues. But if you go back a year, you had our Card Members suddenly not redeeming travel-related benefits, not traveling around, and that caused some unusual declines. Boy, the good news now is they're back traveling. And that recovery means that now we're back incurring some of those costs. And that makes the year-over-year, when you look at it just for the quarter, look a little unusual. That's why for simplicity purposes, we've said, ""Look, we're running at about 40% of total revenues. I'd expect that to be the case for the next few quarters."" Next year, we'll have to see how all parts of the business are performing. 
I guess if I step back from all the math, though, I would just say it's very good thing to see our members back engaged with our travel-related benefits. We feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace given the kind of acquisition and retention numbers Steve talked about. And it's those Card Member engagement costs to drive that tremendous attachment for our existing customers and the ability to attract new customers. So I think the 40% is a good number for the next few quarters, and we'll have to see where it ends up next year, and we'll give you an update.

But I will tell you, I think the largest thing that drove retention at the beginning of this pandemic, not a lot of companies were answering the phone. And our customer satisfaction scores from a servicing perspective really went through the roof for us during the pandemic. We pivoted people to home very, very quickly. We had equipment at the ready for them and they felt safe. They felt secure and they were able to take care of our customers. 
And so at that time, people called American Express, we would then help them. And if you think about the help that we provided to people, it was -- I'm not taking -- I can't take my trip. I'm canceled. I had tickets to this. I had -- whatever it might have been, and we were able to help. And when you help somebody one time, that's a lifetime savior because they'll always remember it. And the reality is, I think it was the combination of outstanding customer service because more people need customer service during this pandemic than they ever did before, especially with cancellations of events. And I think we stood out. I think we stood out among everybody else once again. And I think the value injection and the financial relief programs. And we have continually look to engage with our customers throughout the pandemic and meet their needs. So our hope is -- and we're seeing it persist right now is that we'll continue to retain these customers and build their loyalty. But I wouldn't -- I would not downplay customer services role in this retention. I can't tell you how many e-mails and letters I got that people were calling out to say, ""Look, I was on hold with somebody for 5 hours. And I went to you, and you guys were able to handle it.

There are a lot of companies that are still not even back yet, right? And it's hard to travel when you're not back. That's -- and it's hard to travel when there's nobody to travel to. 
I think New York is a little bit different phenomenon in financial services here. But the reality is, is we're not assuming very much from a corporate travel perspective, minimal improvement from really where we are. So the downside volatility, I think, is negligible. The upside is pretty positive. But again, we're not anticipating a lot of travel. 
Having said that, corporate travel will come back. Anybody that believes that Zoom, WebEx or Google Meets or Microsoft Teams or what have you is going to take the place of face-to-face, it's crazy. It's not. I think it's a great supplement. But ultimately, people will get back. But people are still antsy about getting out there but not so much for consumer travel. They're pretty willing to get out for consumer travel, but they are a little bit -- again, I think for corporate travel, it's a different thing. But the reality is it will come back. And I think there is nothing like face-to-face interaction and business -- and doing business that way. And so -- but I see it more as upside, Rick, and not a volatile downside. Now having said that, if it does come back and then goes down, that's when the volatility comes in. But I think behavior, once it shifts back to corporate travel, I believe, will stay there."

I mean people started to spend on their homes, spend on other lifestyle choices and things like that. And that eventually travel came back. And so I think the wealth of -- if you look at the savings that has accumulated within the United States and the wealth that is accumulated from stock appreciation and what have you, I think that only bodes well for us for people to continue to spend. And so I would anticipate -- and again, we saw this right after 9/11, and we saw this after the financial crisis as well. I've been -- just tells you I've been around a long time.

And what I mean acquiring balances, I'm not talking about 0 interest rate, things like that.

And what I would say about co-brand opportunities, look, we look at them all. That makes sense. And we look at -- predominantly, we've had a lot of travel co brands, obviously. We've also had other co-brands, and people will remember the Costco co-brand, but we've also have a Lowe's co-brand for the small business. Obviously, we have the Amazon co-brand for Small Business as well and not just in the United States, but in a couple of other markets. And we look at the opportunities. And what we do is we look at those opportunities, and can we provide a value proposition that makes sense to our customers and can we do that in an economical way. And an economical way may not just be the economics of the co-brand deal itself. It may also be the economics of what a co-brand could do to the overall portfolio, both positively and negatively. And so there's a lot of things you look at when you evaluate a co-brand. So -- and we'll do what's right for our customers and our shareholders."

International, right now, certainly a different competitive environment internationally than in the United States. You're -- there's not 1 competitor. It's competitors by market, but I would say, at the moment, not a hotbed of activity, small businesses. The viability of a number of small businesses in international markets, not a lot of people have line of sight into those right now. And we're not growing anywhere near like we used to grow. 
If you remember, Small Business International, high double digits, high double-digit teens for 2, 3 years in a row. And so -- and we think we can get back to that. We just don't -- we don't see that happening this year, and we're not counting on it for next year. But internationally, you're competing with local banks and so forth. And again, we've done Amazon deals in multiple countries. And I think that has helped. And we continue to look for partnerships where they make sense. 
In the United States, we continue to grow. In fact, June was 1 of our best acquisition months in the history of our Small Business card in the United States. So we're really pleased with that. 
There is a lot of competition. There's a lot of fintechs. There are banks out there. Capital One is aggressive. U.S. Bank is aggressive. JP -- everybody is aggressive in this space. And ultimately, it comes down to value, and we continue to grow. And again, here, from a Small Business perspective, I think we did a nice job with value injection. I think you will see us continue our strategy of product refreshes over the coming year. 
But I think one of the big things that we've done, obviously, is the Kabbage acquisition. And just last month, we launched the Kabbage checking account, the working capital, cash flow analysis and so forth. And what you'll see ultimately is that Kabbage platform being the landing point for our small businesses. And the way you want to think about this is fintech with scale. 
And so when you think about Kabbage, which is a pure-play fintech in the small business space, and you think about American Express and the small businesses and you combine that together, you have a fintech at scale, not a fintech growing at scale, a fintech growing from scale, from scale with the balance sheet. And so that has always been the vision of Kabbage. We've made -- as you bring Kabbage into the bank holding company structure, you have to do some other things to future-proof it, if you will, and that's what we've been doing. But that's what you will see. Ultimately, what you will see is a fintech with traditional bank scale and a very strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to add products as we move along on to that platform. And that was the vision, right? 
I mean we see a lot of other people out there doing those kinds of things. But to be able to do that at scale from the get-go, I think, is a big win for us. So that's a long -- that's the vision in the medium term here for Kabbage, and we just launched that platform from an Amex perspective just last month with those other products on it."

I don't know if it's a -- it's just a pullback for now from a -- to a reentry. That's a possibility. I know Wells is looking to get stronger in this space. 
And so what we really focus in on it is what we focus in on is developing the best product possible and to make sure we could take on all comers. And some may say in the middle of pandemic, you're relaunching your Platinum card and you're raising the fee. Yes, we are. Why? Because that was part of the strategy. We learned a lot during the pandemic as well. We were able to enhance the product. When you look at it, we added $1,400 worth of additional value for $140 worth of additional cost. And as a great example of leveraging our partnerships, leveraging our know-how, leveraging the digital assets that we have, whether that be Resy or LoungeBuddy or what have you within that overall collection. And so yes, maybe it might look like right now, it's Chase and American Express. And Chase is a very formidable competitor with very smart people who are working really hard to beat us, and we're working really hard to beat them. So -- but I'm not assuming it's going to be just us and Chase for long. I think you will see other people, I think, try and get in this game. And our Platinum refresh is another shot across the bow. And anybody that really wants to come in and play with us and play in this game, we're ready and we'll continue to up our game and up our service and provide even more and more value to our card members. 
And look, as I said in my remarks, the Platinum Refresh last time worked, and that was in the face of JPMorgan Chase entering in with a strong product. And we believe it's going to work this time in early results. And obviously, we're only in for 3 weeks here. But if you just do the value calculation, it is a really strong product, and we're really proud of what we put out in the marketplace."

Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80. These results reflect an acceleration of the momentum we've seen in our core business and a strengthening macro environment.  
Our improving performance is a clear indication that the steps we've taken to manage the company through the pandemic and our investments to rebuild growth momentum are paying off. We're particularly pleased with the progress we're seeing in several key areas, including engaging and retaining our existing customers, acquiring new customers, continued excellent credit performance and an acceleration in spending. Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been investing in short-term value enhancements to several of our premium products, which has helped drive Card Member engagement and contributed to retention levels that remain higher than the last few years.  
We've also ramped up our acquisition engine over the past several quarters, and we're really pleased to see that overall acquisitions of proprietary cards, which include our co-brands, have continued to increase with 2.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. In fact, demand for our premium fee-based products accelerated this quarter, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold cards well above 2019 levels and exceeding prior quarters, contributing to the continued double-digit growth in net card fees. Early spending on these new accounts is strong. We're also pleased to see that acquisitions are increasing in many of our co-brand portfolios. For example, as Ed Bastian mentioned on Delta's earnings call last week, Delta co-brand acquisitions reached 90% of 2019 levels in Q2.  
Turning to credit. We continue to see excellent credit performance with both delinquency and write-off rates improving further and reaching near historic lows in the quarter. We're also seeing continued improvements in Card Member spending. Spending recovery accelerated in Q2 with overall billed business volumes growing 51% in the quarter on an FX-adjusted basis versus last year and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in June. Goods and services volumes continued to strengthen, increasing 16% globally on an FX-adjusted basis versus Q2 2019. Travel and entertainment spending also accelerated in the quarter, particularly in the U.S., where a growing percentage of the population is now fully vaccinated. In fact, we saw a surge in spending by U.S. Consumer Card Members across all T&E categories, with overall U.S. Consumer T&E spending reaching 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and continuing to grow into July. T&E spending outside the U.S. continues to recover more slowly due to the overall -- due to lower overall vaccination rates and government-imposed restrictions in some geographies.  
In our Consumer business, the largest contributor to spending growth in goods and services came from millennial and Gen Z customers, and they are also leading the recovery in T&E spending, with total spending up over 30% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019 levels in Q2 for this age cohort.  
In our Commercial business, overall small and midsized enterprise volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q2, driven by continued strong growth globally in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019. While the T&E recovery also accelerated, with the fastest total growth coming from smaller sized businesses in the U.S.  
We're also seeing solid spending growth in key travel-related co-brand portfolios. Volumes on both Delta and Hilton co-brand cards increased by double digits versus pre-pandemic levels in the quarter, driven by the same trends of continued strong growth in goods and services spending and an acceleration in the recovery of T&E spend. In addition to investing in retention and acquisition activities as a customer-focused company led by innovation, a key part of our investment strategy is geared toward delivering a continuous stream of differentiated products, services and capabilities that provide additional value to our current customers and attract new ones to the franchise. We invest in innovation in a number of ways through inter development, acquisitions, co-brand relationships and partnerships with both digital startups and large well-known brands across a range of industries.  
A great example of our approach to innovation is our strategy for regularly refreshing our unique value propositions by leveraging our digital ecosystem and our diverse network of partners. On July 1, we marked the restart of this strategy with the launch of our new enhanced Platinum Card for consumers in the U.S. The American Express Platinum Card created the Premium card category nearly 40 years ago and has continued to define the category ever since. We intend to make sure it remains a competitive standard for many years to come.  
The reason for Platinum's success over the years, I believe, is twofold. First is our continual focus on knowing our customers and delivering value that meets their evolving needs and preferences. And second is our willingness to change our value propositions even as our products are at the peak of their performance. And that's the case with our most recent refresh. Despite just coming off our best quarter ever for U.S. Platinum account acquisitions, we introduced our new U.S. Consumer Platinum Card, featuring a broader set of lifestyle benefits while doubling down on travel-related benefits. The new benefits are enabled by working with an expanded range of partners as well as the continued integration of our growing portfolio of digital assets such as Resy and LoungeBuddy. I would note that the last time we refreshed our U.S. Platinum Card, we doubled the customer base, bringing in a larger number of younger card members, and our intent with our current refresh is to attract an even broader pool of customers to the franchise.  
In developing the new Platinum card, we listened to our card members and gleaned insights from their spending behavior to determine what features and benefits would be most relevant for the way they live now. For example, some of the spending patterns on certain everyday goods and services categories that emerged during the pandemic, such as streaming services and personal fitness, have continued into the recovery. 
This led us to add a series of annual credits with digital entertainment services and Equinox Club memberships or digital subscriptions to their on-demand app. Our Platinum Card Members have always cared a lot about travel and entertainment. And as our recent quarterly results demonstrate, our U.S.-based customers are eagerly returning to travel and in-person dining. So we added a series of new travel-related benefits to the refreshed product on top of those Platinum Card already offers, including a significant expansion of our proprietary Centurion Lounge network and a new global dining access program powered by Resy, our online reservation platform that provides exclusive access to some of the world's best restaurants and premium dining experiences.  
Enhancements we've made to the U.S. Platinum Card represent a significant increase in value, which we believe will be very attractive to both current and new customers, even with an increase in its annual fee. As we have seen from previous refreshes, customers are willing to pay more for what they see as Platinum's unique value, and we believe it will be no different in this case. In fact, the very early indications are encouraging. Applications and acquisitions have outpaced our expectations in the first 2 weeks since the new Platinum Card became available.  
The U.S. Platinum refresh is just 1 example of how we're leveraging partnerships in our digital ecosystem to innovate and add differentiated value to our products and services. We'll be refreshing other products and rolling out new digital capabilities for both consumer and commercial customers throughout the remainder of the year and beyond.  
We're really excited about the new U.S. Platinum card and the potential that it and other innovations we have in the pipeline represent. And there are many other reasons why I feel very good about where we are at the halfway point in the year, including the progress we're making to rebuild momentum in our core business is accelerating and better than we expected at the beginning of the year. The improvements we're seeing across many of our key metrics are sign that our strategy for managing through the pandemic and investing in activities to rebuild our growth momentum is working. 
We're particularly pleased with the strength we're seeing in customer retention, new account acquisitions, credit performance and overall spending volumes, with goods and services volumes now well above pre-pandemic levels globally and travel and entertainment spending recovering faster than we expected, driven by significant improvement in the United States.  
Taking all of these factors together, we are increasingly optimistic that the strength we've seen in our core business through the first half will continue, particularly in the U.S., even as the pace of recovery remains uneven in different regions around the world. With this in mind, we remain committed to executing our investment strategy for growing our business over the long term. And based on current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we had for 2020 -- in 2022 and to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022.  
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Thank you."
92001,1671459900,2350466,"American Express Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives.  Starti",2524,"Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives.  
Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion were up 31% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, as we lapped the trough of the billings and revenue declines that occurred during the most significant pandemic lockdowns in Q2 of last year. Our second quarter net income was $2.3 billion, and earnings per share was $2.08. These strong results were, of course, in part driven by an $866 million credit reserve release as we saw continued strong credit performance and some improvements in the macroeconomic outlook.  
Now as I turn to a more detailed look at our results, I'll again focus on what we see as the key drivers of our great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives: volumes, credit trends and the marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum. As we've said all year, 2021 itself is a transition year, positioning us for 2022 and beyond.  
So let's now get into the first key driver to watch as we measure our progress this year, volumes, which you will see several views of on Slides 3 through 9. You will note that we have shown second quarter volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, as we find this provides a clearer picture of how spending is recovering on the way to our 2022 financial objectives. And that clear picture on Slide 3 shows an acceleration in the pace of recovery across all of our volumes in the second quarter, with total network volumes and billed business volumes up around 50% year-over-year, as we lapped the trough of the billings declines from Q2 2020.  
Importantly, relative to 2019, total network volumes, billed business and processed volumes were all down just 2% on an FX-adjusted basis and surpassed pre-COVID levels for the month of June. The acceleration in billed business is being driven by both spending on goods and services, which was up 16% versus 2019, as you can see on Slide 4, and by a notable improvement in spending on travel and entertainment in the second quarter. Overall T&E spending reached nearly 70% of 2019 levels as we exited Q2. This is a level we originally expected we would not reach until the fourth quarter of this year. So to see it recovering more quickly than we had expected, and without it coming at the cost of any slowing in the growth in goods and services spending is a positive indicator for us.  
Turning to Slide 5. You do see that the billed business volume recovery is being led by the U.S., which surpassed 2019 levels and was up 3% in the quarter. The recovery in total billed business volumes outside of the U.S. is weaker. Interestingly though, you see on the top right of Slide 5 that the growth in goods and services spending has been strong in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spend is weaker outside the U.S. because historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions, and international T&E is recovering more slowly due to lower vaccination rates and continued government restrictions in certain geographies.  
Focusing in then on just our Consumer business on Slide 6. You see that overall spending was 4% above 2019 levels in the quarter, as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 18% versus 2019. And we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic, even as offline spending recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  
In our commercial business, as you can see on Slide 7, global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spend up 6% versus 2019 for the quarter. This performance was supported by continued growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% versus 2019.  
In contrast, on Slide 8, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We have said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.  
Finally, putting all customer types T&E spending together on Slide 9, you do see improvement across the board in the second quarter, with total T&E spending reaching nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the month of June. As I said earlier, this recovery has been faster than we expected, led by a sharp recovery in U.S. consumer T&E spending, which reached 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and has continued to grow in July.  
Looking ahead, we now assume that overall T&E spending globally will have recovered to around 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021. We also expect continued steady growth in goods and services spending for the remaining 2021. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes.  
Moving to our other volume metric, receivable and loan balances on Slide 10. You'll see a slightly different set of charts here and in a few other places throughout this presentation, where we thought it would be helpful to show comparisons for the first and second quarter relative to both 2020 and 2019 to help you better                  Recovery. Loan balances began to slowly recover in the second quarter and were up 7% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. 
Relative to 2019, though, loan balances remained down 11%, 11% more than spending volumes. We continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes. 
This leads then to the second key driver to watch this year, credit and provision, on Slides 11 through 14. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows, although we would expect loss rates to slowly return to more normal levels eventually. Given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off rates anytime this year. 
This strong credit performance, combined with some improvement in our macroeconomic outlook, drove a $606 million provision expense benefit in the second quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release, as shown on Slide 12. That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $1.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on Slide 13. 
We are closely monitoring how the Card Members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, and early performance of recent exits has looked quite strong. But we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off, and there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment around the world, including in the U.S. So we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. As you see on Slide 14, we ended the second quarter with $4 billion of reserves, representing 5% of loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. 
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to build long-term growth momentum, on Slide 15. We invested $1.3 billion in marketing in the second quarter as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while maintaining some of our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.4 million new cards, up around 20% sequentially. More importantly than just the total number of cards, we've seen great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products up 30% versus the prior quarter and up almost 4x year-over-year. As Steve mentioned, as some great examples, acquisitions of new U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold cards all reached well above 2019 levels this quarter. Based on the momentum we've seen in the first half of this year, we would now expect to see around $5 billion in marketing spend this year. Ultimately, though, our marketing levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities we see and the pace at which we finished winding down our value-injection efforts in the remainder of the year. 
So what does all this mean for revenues on Slide 16? Total revenues were up 33% year-over-year in the second quarter, and we had double-digit growth in almost every 1 of our revenue lines, except for net interest income, which only accounts for 18% of our revenues.  Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues. 
Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, led the recovery, though, as it was up 56% on an FX-adjusted basis year-over-year, as shown on Slide 17. This recovery is primarily driven by the strong growth in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year  at the quarter. 
Importantly, these revenues have been our most resilient revenue line throughout the pandemic, as you can see on Slide 18. They are now $300 million or 30% higher than they were back in the second quarter of 2019, demonstrating the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. 
The one revenue line showing a slower recovery is net interest income on Slide 19, which, as I mentioned, accounts for only 18% of our revenues. For us, though, the driver here is the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. Looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. 
So to sum up on revenues. The momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q2, as you can see on Slide 20. While revenues remain 6% below pre-pandemic levels on an FX-adjusted basis, they were up 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, with the momentum in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first half of the year and our updated assumption that we now expect overall T&E to recover to 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of the year, full year revenue growth could be around 12% to 14%, assuming current trends continue. 
Moving on to expenses. We're continuing to break out, on Slide 21, our variable customer engagement expenses, which moved with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were up 85% year-over-year, driven by higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio. In 2021, full year, given the year-to-date gains we've seen in our equity investment portfolio, I'd now expect our full year OpEx to be a bit below the $11.5 billion we originally expected, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to build growth momentum in our business. 
Turning next to capital on Slide 22. Our capital position remains tremendously strong. Our Q2 CET1 ratio of 14.2% remains far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year and growth in our capital base from earnings that have exceeded distributions. We returned $1.3 billion in total to shareholders this quarter, including common stock repurchases of $908 million and $346 million in common stock dividends. Looking forward, we remain committed to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. Given the Federal Reserve's latest guidance, we plan to increase the pace of share repurchases to migrate towards our CET1 ratio target over the next few quarters. 
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first half of the year might mean for the future. In January and again in April, I laid out 2 scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happens with credit reserves. As a reminder, our scenario 1 [ or ] low scenario assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year, and that we would not release any credit reserves in the subsequent quarters. Now halfway into the year, the macro outlook has improved somewhat, and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. So we've already released $1.9 billion of reserves. That still leaves us, however, with a reserve ratio that is above pre-pandemic levels due to the remaining uncertainties. 
So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 23 assumes that this uncertainty persists; that the medical environment and economic outlook worsens; and that we, therefore, don't release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of an 80% overall T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $7.50 per share. 
Our updated scenario 2, in contrast, assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 12% to 14% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $8.75. 
More important though than these 2021 numbers is our focus on managing the company to further build growth momentum. Our progress this quarter around our key drivers, volumes, credit performance and marketing was very strong, and this gives us confidence that our strategies are working. Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability in 2022 to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had before the pandemic for 2020 of $8.85 to $9.25. And we are confident in our ability to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

On value injection, Sanjay, certainly, with what we're seeing in the world now, we would expect that to continue to go down each quarter and be completely gone by the end of the year. And so that's one of the reasons. As you think about 2022, our overall marketing line dollars should be down a little bit in 2022 from 2021 because value injection will be at zero. But Steve, you probably want to talk a little bit about the demand issues."

So Sanjay, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn't acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we're still ramping up, and we're still not at overall levels",453,"Yes. So Sanjay, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn't acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we're still ramping up, and we're still not at overall levels of acquisition that we want to be at. And the reason for that is you've got international, which is not opened up. And so acquisition levels from an international perspective, both from an SME side of it, from a consumer side of it, is not there. You've got corporate card acquisition. Not a lot of companies are adding a lot of people. And so you don't have that. 
So when you really start to dig into this, a lot of this is really the pent-up demand. And so just take a look at what we're looking at. And we look at Hilton co-brand cards and we look at Delta co-brand cards, we continue to see them sequentially month-over-month add more volume. And what you're now seeing is you're seeing volume being added in T&E, but you are seeing sustained volume growth in goods and services. And so we think we've done a really good job with the value injection in pivoting sort of people how they thought about these cards. 
And so looking back years from now, we may find that one of the sort of the bright spots of this for us from a spending perspective is people found other ways to use their cards, and we actually improved our goods and services mix. So I think you're seeing that pent-up demand coming from existing cardholders. And yet, we're not back to travel levels in any way, shape or form. 
The other thing, if you start to sort of dig into our spending by sort of age group, we mentioned that our millennial spending is up 30% over 2019. Well, then you can just take that and you go to the boomers and you go to our next level of people, and that spending is still building up. So we believe there's still a lot of spending within our existing base. 
You look at corporate spending, which is about half of what it was. Small Business, while doing very well from a goods and services perspective is still challenged from a T&E perspective. And so we believe that a lot of the growth that we've had has come from the existing base, and I think there's more to come from that existing base. And as we get more and more Card Members on board, you're going to see more spending there as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color."

So if you think about -- let's go back to why. So why did we do the value injection? So we did the value injection to make sure that the value propositions that were challenged at the time, which were predominantly travel-based value propositions, would no -- people wouldn't look at it and say, ""I'm not getting value from the card."" And that was -- I think that we'll look back on that as a very important decision because what it said to our customers is that, ""Look, we know that you are -- you bought the product for a specific reason. You cannot use that product to -- we always talk about experiences and access, and you can't get that."" And so what we did was, and I give our teams and our marketing teams a tremendous amount of credit here, is we look for categories that people were going to really double down on in streaming services, wireless services, more shipping services. Even dining on some of our co-brand cards, and we invested a lot of money in value injection. 
The other thing that we did is we also, at the top end on our Platinum and our Centurion, is put credits in for travel, okay, which is one of the reasons our -- I think our TLS bookings are now above 2019 levels in June. And we continue that at the beginning of the year because the beginning of the year, we were still unsure, but we changed the value injection. So on Platinum Card, we went to a PayPal credit. And that PayPal credit was to get more embedding within that ecosystem so that you have more cards on file. But our plan has been and always has been is that the value that we have in our products stands on its own. And once we got to the point where people could take advantage of, of the existing product, and this is predominantly more of a U.S. phenomenon at this particular point in time, you didn't need that value injection. 
And so then we get back to, okay, what did we learn? And then you look at the Platinum refresh. And if you look at the Platinum refresh, what does that have? Well, it has a wider variety of components to it in terms of streaming. It has digital credits, whether it's Sirius or Peacock or New York Times or what have you. And it also has another travel credit within there. And so we don't believe we need to rely on value injection at all. 
And so as you look at the high marketing going forward, we believe the value of the products will stand for themselves. Having said that, we're also going to go back on our quest to continue to refresh our product portfolio. And you're seeing that. You obviously just start it with the Platinum Card, and we're not going to stop at the Platinum card, but I'll stop at that comment at this point. 
And so when you look at the $5 billion in spending, what we made the decision this year is we weren't going to cap that spending. So at the beginning of the year, you're seeing a lot of value injection, but we also made decisions at the beginning to go in with more customer acquisition. And so we'll continue to do that, which will drive us closer to the $5 billion. 
But the bottom line on this is that our products were resilient through this. We propped them up a little bit. We learned a lot. And what we're seeing with our consumers right now is that they are utilizing these value propositions. And they're utilizing these value propositions with lounge visits, with bookings, by using the travel credits and all the benefits that come with Gold and Platinum. 
We talked a lot about Platinum, but the Gold Card, too, is another premium product that we have, and that has been positioned a lot more as a dining product. And that has taken off as restaurants, especially in the United States, have come back. So the short answer, I guess, is that we don't believe we need value injection anymore. We believe the value in the products will continue to sustain the spending."

I think you've got a situation in Europe. Look at Japan with the Olympics, right? I mean everybody is expecting spectators to be, that there's no spectators there. You've got Australia, which is still closed. You've got the U.K., which is battling the Delta variant. And so I don't know what's going to happen with international. 
Having said that, our billings continue to improve in international. People, much like they were in the U.S., are looking for ways to travel, whether that be car trips, whether that be more restaurant and so forth. And so I don't really expect international to come back this year and hopefully, at some point next year. But that's really all going to be driven by vaccination and the efficacy of vaccinations. 
And remember, the vaccines that are available in different -- in other countries are not the same vaccines that are available in the United States. And there's different efficacy on all different types of vaccines, whether that's AstraZeneca, which has like a 67% efficacy; or it's a Moderna or a Pfizer, which is up at 88%. And so what you're seeing in the U.K. now is vaccinating -- vaccinated people actually get COVID, not being hospitalized or dying, but still getting COVID. So I don't think we're going to see international come back this year. I think -- and it's not really in our -- we look at it as a tailwind for sort of 2022 and 2023 for us. 
As far as China goes, look, China is -- we're really pleased with what's going on in China. And part of the China story is continuing to build the network and continue to build the card base, and we continue month-over-month to build that network and to build that card base. And as we move into other quarters, we'll provide more insight into what's going on. But I'm not -- I wouldn't say you're going to expect China to be a material part of our revenue base or our earnings base in the near-term future, more medium to long term. But I'd also like to remind everybody of the model that we have in China. 
The model that we have in China is a network-based model. And a way to think about a network-based model is to think about that model much like Visa and MasterCard's normal model is. We're not taking card fees. We're not getting a discount rate. We're getting network fees, and that's the way that's working. But we are building China. We believe it will add more scale, not only for us, and more presence in China for both our card members at travel ad, but it will also add scale for us as people -- as Chinese Card Members travel outside of China and add more scale and add more volume to the overall network. So China will not be material in the near term."

But we're committed to being in that 10% to 11% range, and that means we got a lot of capital to return to shareholders."

So what's driving that? The first thing I want to -- so to clear",551,"So as we think about next year and now, look, we went from comments of our aspiration was to be in the range to comments today of our anticipation is we'll be at the high end of the range. So what's driving that? 
The first thing I want to -- so to clearly state is, given that the recovery is uneven, we will continue to invest as we've been investing. And I think we have pulled back in our international card investment right now because it just doesn't make a lot of sense to continue to double down on that. And so we will continue, as we move into next year, to invest in not only our U.S. card acquisition, but international card acquisition, both small business and premium products. 
What are the assumptions behind sort of next year's getting to that high end? Well, look, we need consumer T&E to fully recover in 2022. And it's on a path to do that. So that is, I think, good. Obviously, like a reasonably healthy economy as well. And so all things being equal, things continue the way they are in the U.S., we feel really confident. 
What's not in those financial objectives is the following: a full recovery of net interest income. And you can look at our revenue, and you see where we are from a net interest income perspective. Corporate T&E is not factored in there, which we don't believe that will come back until 2023. Cross-border T&E, we believe, will continue to be challenged. And the comments that Jeff just made about international, while goods and services, we think will continue to grow. I think consumer T&E and corporate T&E and international will continue to be challenged. So if that comes back, obviously, that provides upside and there would be tailwinds for 2022, but we'd more be counting on those as tailwinds for 2023. But again, it's really hard to predict. But that's a positive for us. 
The one thing I will have people keep in mind, though, is that we have -- we've had some big reserve releases. And as Jeff mentioned, when we talk about sort of 750 to 875, the 875 would anticipate some more releases, which would mean even bigger reserve releases. And so you have to grow over that.  And part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary bill that we did last year. But I'd like to point out the other part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary job our credit team is doing. And so that's the other piece of it that we take into account. All that being said, we feel really good about how we're tracking for this year. And that's why we feel good about saying the high end of the range for 2022. 
And I just gave you a bunch of upside possibilities, and I just gave you the grow-over possibility as well, with the awesome notion is we're not going to get the marketing cutting -- we're not going to cut marketing to get there. We're not going to be at $5 billion because we will not have value injection there, but we will continue to invest in marketing because I think it has proven for us to be a great source of revenue growth."

In fact, I'd like to point out that the dollars that we have grown net card fees by about more than $300 million a quarter since 2019. Interestingly, kind of offsets the drop in net interest income, and we have a lot further to go. 
All that said, as most of you know, the accounting for card fees is a little complicated because we amortize people's card fee payments over 12 months after they pay them. And so that causes the trends to move slowly. So I've said through much of this year that I expected card fee growth, because we weren't acquiring a lot of new card members last year, to slow quite significantly in the back half of the year. 
I will tell you now that with the tremendous progress on bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise, I think you might see a little bit of slowing in the next couple of quarters before it reaccelerates next year. But boy, it's a lot less than we originally anticipated. 
The other thing I would remind people of is it's really bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise that drives that card fee growth. And in fact, when you think, Steve, about the Platinum refresh that you talked about. While we raised the fee for existing Card Members, that fee actually doesn't hit until their anniversary date next year. And then once it hits, we'll amortize it over 12 months. So it's a lovely long tailwind, but it's not going to be the driver of the next couple of quarters."

First, because of the effects of the pandemic, the variable customer engagement costs sort of have been flowing with revenues. But if you go back a year, you had our Card Members suddenly not redeeming travel-related benefits, not traveling around, and that caused some unusual declines. Boy, the good news now is they're back traveling. And that recovery means that now we're back incurring some of those costs. And that makes the year-over-year, when you look at it just for the quarter, look a little unusual. That's why for simplicity purposes, we've said, ""Look, we're running at about 40% of total revenues. I'd expect that to be the case for the next few quarters."" Next year, we'll have to see how all parts of the business are performing. 
I guess if I step back from all the math, though, I would just say it's very good thing to see our members back engaged with our travel-related benefits. We feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace given the kind of acquisition and retention numbers Steve talked about. And it's those Card Member engagement costs to drive that tremendous attachment for our existing customers and the ability to attract new customers. So I think the 40% is a good number for the next few quarters, and we'll have to see where it ends up next year, and we'll give you an update."

But I will tell you, I think the largest thing that drove retention at the beginning of this pandemic, not a lot of companies were answering the phone. And our customer satisfaction scores from a servicing perspective really went through the roof for us during the pandemic. We pivoted people to home very, very quickly. We had equipment at the ready for them and they felt safe. They felt secure and they were able to take care of our customers. 
And so at that time, people called American Express, we would then help them. And if you think about the help that we provided to people, it was, ""I'm not taking -- I can't take my trip, I'm canceled, I had tickets to this, I had --""  Whatever it might have been, and we were able to help. And when you help somebody one time, that's a lifetime savior because they'll always remember it. And the reality is, I think it was the combination of outstanding customer service because more people needed customer service during this pandemic than they ever did before, especially with cancellations of events. 
And I think we stood out. I think we stood out among everybody else once again. And I think the value injection and the financial relief programs. And we have continually look to engage with our customers throughout the pandemic and meet their needs. So our hope is -- and we're seeing it persist right now is that we'll continue to retain these customers and build their loyalty. But I wouldn't -- I would not downplay customer services role in this retention. I can't tell you how many e-mails and letters I got that people were calling out to say, ""Look, I was on hold with somebody for 5 hours. And I went to you, and you guys were able to handle it. You answered the call in 4 or 5 minutes."" So I think that really helped a lot, Lisa. I really do."

There are a lot of companies that are still not even back yet, right? And it's hard to travel when you're not back. That's -- and it's hard to travel when there's nobody to travel to. 
I think New York is a little bit different phenomenon in financial services here. But the reality is, is we're not assuming very much from a corporate travel perspective, minimal improvement from really where we are. So the downside volatility, I think, is negligible. The upside is pretty positive. But again, we're not anticipating a lot of travel. 
Having said that, corporate travel will come back. Anybody that believes that Zoom, WebEx or Google Meets or Microsoft Teams or what have you is going to take the place of face-to-face, it's crazy. It's not. I think it's a great supplement. But ultimately, people will get back. But people are still antsy about getting out there but not so much for consumer travel. They're pretty willing to get out for consumer travel, but they are a little bit -- again, I think for corporate travel, it's a different thing. But the reality is it will come back. And I think there is nothing like face-to-face interaction and business -- and doing business that way. And so -- but I see it more as upside, Rick, and not a volatile downside.

Well, I think -- let me just -- I'll just mention international. International, right now, certainly a different competitive environment internationally than in the United States. You're -- there's not 1 competitor. It's competitors by market, but I",563,"Yes. Well, I think -- let me just -- I'll just mention international. International, right now, certainly a different competitive environment internationally than in the United States. You're -- there's not 1 competitor. It's competitors by market, but I would say, at the moment, not a hotbed of activity, small businesses. The viability of a number of small businesses in international markets, not a lot of people have line of sight into those right now. And we're not growing anywhere near like we used to grow. 
If you remember, Small Business International, high double digits, high double-digit teens for 2, 3 years in a row. And so -- and we think we can get back to that. We just don't -- we don't see that happening this year, and we're not counting on it for next year. But internationally, you're competing with local banks and so forth. And again, we've done Amazon deals in multiple countries. And I think that has helped. And we continue to look for partnerships where they make sense. 
In the United States, we continue to grow. In fact, June was one of our best acquisition months in the history of our Small Business card in the United States. So we're really pleased with that. 
There is a lot of competition. There's a lot of fintechs. There are banks out there. Capital One is aggressive, u.S. Bank is aggressive, JP -- everybody is aggressive in this space. And ultimately, it comes down to value, and we continue to grow. And again, here, from a Small Business perspective, I think we did a nice job with value injection. I think you will see us continue our strategy of product refreshes over the coming year. 
But I think one of the big things that we've done, obviously, is the Kabbage acquisition. And just last month, we launched the Kabbage checking account, the working capital, cash flow analysis and so forth. And what you'll see ultimately is that Kabbage platform being the landing point for our small businesses. And the way you want to think about this is fintech with scale. 
And so when you think about Kabbage, which is a pure-play fintech in the small business space, and you think about American Express and the small businesses and you combine that together, you have a fintech at scale, not a fintech growing at scale, a fintech growing from scale, from scale with the balance sheet. And so that has always been the vision of Kabbage. We've made -- as you bring Kabbage into the bank holding company structure, you have to do some other things to future-proof it, if you will, and that's what we've been doing. But that's what you will see. Ultimately, what you will see is a fintech with traditional bank scale and a very strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to add products as we move along on to that platform. And that was the vision, right? 
I mean we see a lot of other people out there doing those kinds of things. But to be able to do that at scale from the get-go, I think, is a big win for us. So that's a long -- that's the vision in the medium term here for Kabbage, and we just launched that platform from an Amex perspective just last month with those other products on it."

And so what we really focus in on, Craig, is what we focus in on is developing the best product possible and to make sure we could take on all comers. And some may say in the middle of pandemic, you're relaunching your Platinum card and you're raising the fee. Yes, we are. Why? Because that was part of the strategy. We learned a lot during the pandemic as well. We were able to enhance the product. When you look at it, we added $1,400 worth of additional value for $140 worth of additional cost. 
And as a great example of leveraging our partnerships, leveraging our know-how, leveraging the digital assets that we have, whether that be Resy or LoungeBuddy or what have you within that overall collection. And so yes, maybe it might look like right now, it's Chase and American Express. And Chase is a very formidable competitor with very smart people who are working really hard to beat us, and we're working really hard to beat them. So -- but I'm not assuming it's going to be just us and Chase for long. I think you will see other people, I think, try and get in this game. And our Platinum Refresh is another shot across the bow. And anybody that really wants to come in and play with us and play in this game, we're ready and we'll continue to up our game and up our service and provide even more and more value to our card members. 
And look, as I said in my remarks, the Platinum Refresh last time worked, and that was in the face of JPMorgan Chase entering in with a strong product. And we believe it's going to work this time in early results. And obviously, we're only in for 3 weeks here. But if you just do the value calculation, it is a really strong product, and we're really proud of what we put out in the marketplace."

Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion, up 25% over last year's third quarter and earnings per share of $2.27. These strong results once again ref",1372,"Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion, up 25% over last year's third quarter and earnings per share of $2.27. These strong results once again reflect accelerating momentum in our core business as billings on our network reached record highs for the third quarter driven by goods and services spending. 
In my remarks this morning, I want to put into context the decisions that we've made prepandemic, when the pandemic hit and during the pandemic to drive the growth we are now seeing and the increased confidence we now have in our business model. In 2018, we introduced a new financial growth algorithm, which call for high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. Prior to the pandemic, we achieved those objectives for 10 straight quarters through focused and increased investment levels in our business. We executed strategies for profitably growing the business, which were based on initiatives to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers in both our consumer and commercial businesses. 
And while our differentiated business model gave us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities we saw, we also knew that the favorable economic conditions we had at the time could change. So we also developed a plan for winning through the down cycle that focused on protecting our customers and our colleagues in maintaining our capital strength while investing strategically and at the right time to rebuild momentum so we could win during the recovery. 
Through it all, the driving force behind everything we do from product innovations to our investment decisions is to continue to make the American Express brand special and back our customers. Over the last several years, we focused our strategies on broadening the appeal of core products to attract new customers, particularly millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our leadership position with SME customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. 
To accomplish those objectives, we made a series of investments and I'll highlight a few. We put in place a strategy for consistently refreshing our core premium products, adding value with expanded and relevant new benefits targeted at key consumer and small business customers, and we charge for that added value. We added a host of new digital capabilities for consumers and small businesses and expanded and enhanced our mobile app to appeal to the digital lifestyles of our target customers. We're an early mover in launching our buy now pay later capability, Pay It Plan It, which we introduced to address the evolving borrowing preferences of our customers. 
We increased our focus on working with strategic partners to help us enrich our value propositions, expand our network and broaden our digital capabilities and offerings. For example, we negotiated wide-ranging long-term agreements with key co-brand partners such as Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We also expanded partnerships with digital giants such as PayPal and added a variety of new partners to our ecosystem, including fintechs, such as Bill.com and Better and lifestyle brands such as Equinox. We achieved virtual parity coverage in the U.S. and we increased coverage internationally through a more targeted approach while increasing the number of compelling offers and benefits that our merchants delivered to our card members. 
When the pandemic hit unexpectedly in early 2020, we responded by activating our plan for winning through the cycle using the same customer-focused approach to concentrate on retaining our customers and addressing their immediate needs. We moved quickly to enhance and expand our financial relief programs to assist our customers who suddenly face financial hardships. Our frontline servicing team stepped up to ensure we continue to provide the world-class service our customers have come to expect from American Express. 
We pivoted the value propositions of several of our premium products, adding temporary benefits on categories that were relevant to how customer spending behaviors have changed, such as wireless, streaming, food delivery and others. This has produced lasting behavioral changes as spending in a number of these categories, including wireless and streaming, has proven to be sustainable. Soon after, we turned our attention to small businesses who needed help by launching the largest global small business campaign in the company's history, creating a stand for small coalition and supporting minority-owned small businesses in the United States. 
As last year progressed, we learned from our customers what resonated with them in this unprecedented environment, and we grew more confident to seize the growth opportunities we saw emerging. So we revved up our investments in card member acquisitions and value proposition innovations to capitalize on those opportunities and start rebuilding of our growth momentum. 
We also saw an opportunity to accelerate our strategy to bring new digital beyond the card capabilities to our small business customers and acquired Kabbage, one of the leading providers of digital cash management platforms. Importantly, the increasing demand we are seeing for our products and what we learn from the early value proposition enhancements encouraged us to restart our product refresh strategy last year. And in July, we launched our new consumer Platinum Card in the U.S. We're repeating this customer-led product innovation strategy with the refresh of the U.S. Business Platinum card, which we launched last week. As with the consumer card refresh, the new benefits we added to our Business Platinum and key spend categories such as electronics, software, shipping, wireless and others were informed by our card member desires. 
Coming into 2021, we were emboldened by the strong results we were seeing towards the end of 2020 from our customer retention and acquisition efforts, and we decided to double down our investments in marketing, product innovation, technology and people to accelerate our growth momentum. All these decisions, those that we made before the pandemic. when the pandemic hit and through this year as conditions begin to improve, are driving the results we're seeing today. 
For example, customer acquisitions have gained momentum over the last 5 quarters with 2.6 million new cards in force in the third quarter. Demand for our premium fee-based products has been particularly robust with acquisitions of our U.S. consumer and small Business Platinum and Gold Cards reaching all-time highs in the quarter. In consumer, millennial and Gen Z customers have driven this growth with 75% of new U.S. Gold and Platinum consumer cards coming from these customers. In commercial, we had one of the best quarters ever, the U.S. small business card acquisitions. 
Our focus on meeting the needs of SMEs and millennial and Gen Z consumer customers has resulted in these groups being the most resilient throughout the pandemic, leading to growth in spending. In fact, spending from these groups continued to accelerate in the third quarter with goods and services spending from SMEs growing 21% above 2019 levels and overall spending for millennial and Gen Z customers, particularly strong, up 38% over 2019 levels. 
Our initiatives to protect our customers at the beginning of the pandemic has driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than prepandemic levels, and the digital capabilities we've introduced have driven steady increases in digital engagement. For example, approximately 85% of active card members are digitally engaged with us, and we had the highest ever daily active user engagement across the web and mobile in August with a nearly 17% increase year-over-year. 
As these examples show the strategies we implemented to profitably grow our business before the pandemic began, coupled with the decisions we made in executing our strategy to manage through the pandemic and to win during a recovery, have generated strong, consistent momentum as the environment continues to improve. And what we've learned through this past year is [ improving ] our strategy for investing to profitably grow our business moving forward. 
Looking ahead, we're operating from a position of strength, and we see even more opportunities to build on the momentum we've created. So we will continue to invest strategically in seeking to drive even higher levels of sustainable long-term revenue and EPS growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss our third quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Thank you."
92001,1682652769,2409825,"American Express Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke about. You see this momentum in",2741,"Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke about. You see this momentum in our summary financials on Slide 2 with third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis; third quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.27. 
To get right into a more detailed look at our results, let's talk about how the strategies that Steve just discussed have helped to drive our volumes back above prepandemic levels, as you can see on Slide 3. You will notice in the several views of volumes that begin on Slide 3 that we continue to show third quarter volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, as we find this provides a clearer picture of the progress we are making in building growth momentum. We did see continued momentum in spending volumes in the third quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes both up around 30% year-over-year and up 4% relative to 2019 on an FX-adjusted basis. 
This growth in billed business is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which you can see on Slide 4 represents 79% of our overall business and was up 19% versus 2019 and strengthened sequentially versus Q2. We are very pleased with this continued strength in goods and services spending given the investments we've made in premium card member engagement, prospect acquisition, growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners. 
Focusing in first on our consumer business on Slide 5. Overall spending was 9% above 2019 levels as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 20% above 2019 in the third quarter. For many years, we've been focused on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities. Aided by these efforts, you see that millennials and gen z customers are leading the growth in spending  reaching 38% above 2019 levels for the quarter, while older age cohorts have shown continued steady though smaller, improvement as well. 
Turning to our commercial business. As you know, we've been very focused on helping our small and medium-sized enterprise clients run their business by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs. This strategic focus on SMEs has been key in driving the performance you see on Slide 6. 
Global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spending up 11% versus 2019 driven by strong growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which grew 21% above 2019 levels in Q3. In contrast, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We've said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. 
Digging into goods and services spending trends on Slide 7. We continue to see strong growth in online and card nonpresent spending, which was up 27% versus 2019 even as off-line spending fully recovered in the third quarter, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. We also saw growth across all categories of goods and services spending with both consumer and SMEs driving the strong growth in retail and wholesale spending and SMEs leading the growth in advertising and media spending. 
Turning now to T&E spending on Slide 8. You continue to see a recovery that is on track with our expectation that we'll reach 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. T&E spending improved sequentially versus Q2, and we're pleased to see restaurant spending, our most resilient and now largest T&E category, back above prepandemic levels in the quarter. We did see some modest impacts from the Delta variant in the airline category, where the pace of recovery slowed a bit in August, but it has strengthened again in September and into early October. 
The trends we have seen reinforce our view. The travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover but at varying paces across customer types and geographies. And we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel. 
Turning to our last look at volumes on Slide 9. You do see that the overall billed business volume recovery continues to be led by the U.S., which first surpassed 2019 levels in Q2 and was up 9% in the third quarter. Importantly, though, growth in goods and services spending has been strong both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spending is only weaker outside the U.S. because, historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions. And international T&E is recovering more slowly than in the U.S. given cross-border travel restrictions. 
Looking ahead, based on current trends, we still assume that overall T&E spending globally will recover to around 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even more importantly, we expect continued strong growth momentum in goods and services spending. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes. 
Moving on then to the receivable and loan balances on Slide 10. Loan balances continued to slowly recover in the third quarter and were up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Relative to 2019, though, loan balances remain down 10% as we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. I would point out that we have hit an inflection point on revolving loan balances. No, it will take time for those balances to rebuild as paydown rates are likely to remain elevated in the near term. We believe, over the long term, we can get back to growing our loan volumes faster than the industry. For the next few quarters, though, I continue to expect the recovery in loan balances to lag recovery in spending volumes. 
Turning next to credit and provision on Slides 11 through 13. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time. However, given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off rates in the next few quarters. 
This strong credit performance, combined with further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, drove $191 million provision expense benefit in the third quarter, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release as shown on Slide 12. That said, we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off and that there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment. In addition, we are closely monitoring how the card members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, though the early performance of the card members that have exited these programs has looked quite strong. 
As you see on Slide 13, we ended the quarter -- third quarter with $3.6 billion of representing 4.5% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively, which is only slightly below the reserve levels we had pre pandemic. So given that our credit metrics are still around historical lows, I would say that we continue to hold an appropriately significant amount of reserves driven by the remaining uncertainties I just spoke about. 
Moving next to revenues. On Slide 14. Total revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. We had double-digit growth in all of our noninterest revenue lines, and we are starting to see growth in net interest income as well. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the third quarter primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we are beginning to see, though they still remain well below 2019 levels. 
Turning to our largest revenue line discount revenue. On Slide 15, you see it grew 33% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis and is now comfortably above 2019 levels. This growth is primarily driven by the steady momentum in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues continued to grow as consistently as they have throughout the entire pandemic up 27% year-over-year in the third quarter. These card fee revenues are now 27% higher than they were back in the third quarter of 2019, as you can see on Slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. 
Turning to net interest income on Slide 17, you can see that it was up 6% year-over-year. Though still growing slower relative to the other revenue lines, we have clearly hit an inflection point. This growth is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs into higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. We did see a modest sequential improvement in revolving loan balances in the third quarter. But looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. 
So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q3, as you can see on Slide 18, with revenue up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Looking forward, with the strength in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year, we now assume that full year revenue growth could be around 15% if current trends continue. 
The revenue momentum we've seen this year has clearly been accelerated as a result of the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, technology and people, and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. Let me start at the bottom with operating expenses, which were up 3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Looking forward, I still expect our full year OpEx to be below the $11.5 billion we originally expected as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing in technology and our people to drive long-term growth in our business. 
Moving on to variable customer engagement expenses. At the top of Slide 19, there are a few things to think about. Most importantly, in 2020, we added some incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value proposition. The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing investment line and are now winding down. We are able to wind them down because our customers are again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, which is a good thing in terms of longer-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does, however, mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. 
As one example of the financial implications of customers, again, engaging in travel-related aspects of our Membership Rewards program. In the rewards line, we made a roughly $200 million adjustment this quarter to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. Looking forward, as I've said in the past few quarters, I'd expect these variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 40% of total revenues. 
Turning next to the marketing investments we're making to build growth momentum. You can see on Slide 20 that we invested $1.4 billion in marketing in the third quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisition while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.6 million new cards, up 87% year-over-year and 6% sequentially in the third quarter. Much more importantly though, than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from new acquisitions. And revenues from this quarter's acquisitions are trending stronger than what we saw pre pandemic. 
One key driver of this performance is the great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products more than doubling year-over-year and representing 65% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. In particular, acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small Business Platinum and Global Card members were at all-time highs this quarter. And this was again one of the best quarters for small business new account acquisitions in the U.S. 
Based on the opportunities we've seen in the first 3 quarters of 2021, we now expect to invest over $5 billion in marketing for the year. We feel really good about the results we've seen from our strategic investments and see an opportunity to continue to invest during the recovery to maximize sustainable long-term growth. 
Turning next to capital on Slide 21. Our CET1 ratio was 12.6% at the end of the third quarter, which declined from the prior quarter but remained above our target ratio of 10% to 11%. In the quarter, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, including common stock purchases of $3.3 billion and $337 million in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation. Looking forward, we expect our CET1 ratio to migrate to our target range over the next few quarters as we continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we hold and generate while supporting balance sheet growth. 
So let's close by talking about what the signs and momentum we saw in the first 3 quarters of this year might mean for the future. As a reminder, we started the year with a wide range of scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 is we did not know how the medical and economic environment would evolve during the year and the impact it would have, most importantly, on our credit reserves. 
Now 3 quarters into the year, the macro outlook has steadily improved, and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. We've already released $2.3 billion of reserves accounting for over $2 of EPS year-to-date. That still leaves us, however, with a lot of reserves due to the remaining uncertainties I spoke about earlier. So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 22 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical environment and economic outlook does not improve further and that we, therefore, don't release any additional credit reserves this year. That could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $8.90 per share. 
Our updated scenario 2 in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance as the remaining stimulus and forbearance programs roll off and that we also see continued improvement in the economic outlook leading to less uncertainty and, in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $9.50. 
In closing, we feel really good about the progress we've made this year as a result of our investments in marketing, value propositions, technology and our people. And as the year has gone on, we've gotten even more confident in our ability to deploy significant resources towards building sustainable long-term growth momentum. Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had for 2020 in 2022 and to continue to drive towards higher levels of sustainable growth over the long term. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

So can you maybe just one, Jeff, talk about some of the puts and takes that -- such that you wouldn't be above the high end, given how much leverage you have from credit?

So we see that as a pretty impressive grow-over to, in fact, be confident in getting to the high end of where we originally thought we'd be in 2020 next year. Considering the magnitude of that grow-over, considering that it's not reliant on a full recovery across all of our businesses, we actually see tailwinds that probably will help us in '22 and into 23. And that's why, as I turn it over to Steve, I think we are so emboldened by the progress we've seen bringing new people into the franchise, Ryan, that we think we have an opportunity here to continue to invest significant resources to drive longer term even higher levels of sustainable growth."

But we're not governed by what level we think we should or what anybody thinks we should hit. We're governed by the fact that there are tremendous opportunities out there. And when you look at what is going on sort of what our acquisition activity is right now, look, we brought in 2.6 million cardholders. And what we really focus on is what revenue those cardholders really bring in. And what we're seeing is we're seeing a cardholder base that is spending more than we're bringing in, that has a better FICO profile, and it's skewing millennial and it's skewing fee pay. 
And so as we run our models, we'll be governed by can we continue to acquire these card members, and we are. And the reality is, is that -- and I said this from day 1, we're running this for the long -- the medium to long term. And the reality is if we continue to find those great opportunities in the consumer base, in the SME base, in some opportunities beyond the card that we might have, we'll continue to invest. 
So as we look at it right now, our plan is to continue to be aggressive with our investments constrained by our investment return models not constrained by a certain level that people think we should or should not be at. And that's just the way we've been running the business for the last few years, and we'll continue to do that. And I think it's really served us well during the pandemic. I don't think you would have thought that this year we would have spent that kind of money. And -- but I think the key point is we're spending that money to grow the business profitably. We're not spending that money because we're in some battle to keep up with the Joneses here, okay?"

The marketing represents constant or similar to where it was in 2019. We're governed by the universe of really attractive opportunities we see to build longer-term growth momentum. So that's what has driven our marketing spend now, including value injection to over $5 billion this year, much higher than Steve and I started the year thinking it would be. And as we think about 2022, we're very confident in the kind of EPS outcome that we've been talking about. But the ultimate amount of marketing that goes with that is going to be a function of the attractive opportunities. 
And because we're getting such great growth from the spending, as Steve talked about, we're actually generating more revenue from the dollars that we're investing in marketing than we were pre pandemic. The marketing starts to become a little self-funding while still hitting our EPS targets if the opportunities are there. So that's what's going to drive us in terms of how much marketing we do next year. And was there a part 2, Betsy? The operator keeps you on."

But when we look at the range of competitors, you have to realize that we're looking at competitors on a global basis, country by country. We're looking at competitors across corporate card, small business and consumer cords. And I think as we talk to -- quite honestly, as we talk to you guys about competition, where the drive tends to be is consumer competition in the U.S. And the reality is that this has been a competitive market since the financial crisis. I mean, I think the consumer card competition really heated up after the financial crisis when the big money center banks decided to really get serious about their consumer card business. And a lot of them have done a really good job, and we compete very vigorously with them. And so I don't really think it -- in my mind, I don't think it's changed all that much. I think it paused a little bit during the pandemic, but I don't think it's changed at all. 
The other thing that I would say is there are a range of other competitors out there, fintechs and what have you. And we continue to watch them, whether it's competitors in the corporate card space, competitors in other places. From a buy now pay later perspective, that's not really a big competitive threat to us. I mean when you think about buy-now-pay-later, it tends to be targeted at low FICO. It tends to be targeted at a lot of debit card users. It's used as a customer acquisition vehicle. And that's just not the game that we're playing. We've had a buy now pay later product since 2017, and it's just another way for our card members to manage their spending within the overall American Express relationship. It's a transaction-by-transaction management tool, which, quite honestly, is a lot more flexible than point-of-sale buy now pay later because you don't know who's going to actually have point-of-sale at every merchant you go to. And then for the paying 4 people, which is also another thing that's out there, which is a version of buy now pay later, there, actually, our charge card product gives you more float and gives you rewards. 
So but you have to look at all this stuff, whether it's whoever is coming into the space. So we look at competitors all the time, and you have to evaluate how it attacks your customer base. But I think the way we run this business, and you've seen this over decades, is we continually to put more value and build a bigger moat around our customers. And just look at what we've done with the Platinum Card here, we refreshed this product while it was going gangbusters, both of them. We were at record levels of Platinum acquisition before the refresh, and yet, we went out and refreshed and went out and raised the fee. And how can you do that? Because you're adding more value, both on the consumer side and both on the small business side. And so look, in the third quarter, we have record levels of not only Gold and -- not only Platinum but Gold Card acquisition for our base. So we feel really good about that. 
I think as far as how you spend your money, look, we do -- obviously, the industry has changed. You do a lot less direct, you do a lot less direct mail than you used to do. You do -- there's a lot more sort of aggregator acquisition. But I think what's really important about us and as we look at our marketing spend, we look at our marketing spend not only for prospect marketing, but we invest in our customers. And we spend marketing money on our customers to continue to grow their spend to upgrade their product, to introduce them to our lending capabilities. And it creates a flywheel, right? Because what you do is you bring these prospects in and then you manage these prospects and get them to become more and more profitable. 
And one of the things that we  hang our hat on is we look at our customers as a platform for growth. And if you can continue to do more and more with your customers, they will generate more revenue. You'll have more loyalty, and you're seeing that. You're seeing that in our retention metrics. And so we really look at our marketing spend, it's not just acquisition. It's also with our existing customer base. So -- and that's probably changed a little bit more over the years as we've invested more and more on our customers as our -- as the product set that we have continues to expand."

And look, we  have a -- we have relationships with 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. And when we compete, as we compete, sometimes we compete with other money center banks that have corporate card programs and also have transaction banking, and they tend to integrate that. And so Goldman is very interested in getting into transaction banking not as necessarily as interested in getting into the corporate card. We do a number of things with Goldman Sachs. From a customer perspective, they are a customer of ours. We're a customer of theirs. And as John and David and I were talking about things, it looked like a really good opportunity. They were trying to ramp up their transaction banking. We have the corporate card and putting those things together in that space, a space that we really weren't going to get into transaction banking as related to large banks. It's not -- it's just not our space, okay? Corporate card is, but not transaction banking. 
So we've decided to look at the top 250. And if that goes well, and there's no reason why it will not go well, then we can put it a little bit more downstream to, say, the S&P 500. We have a different perspective as it relates to the SMB space, which is why, if you remember, what we've talked about from an SMB perspective is we wanted to be the working capital providers for our small businesses. And now in the small business space, we have a very good footprint not only in the United States but good footprints and internationally. 
You also remember during the pandemic, we bought Kabbage. And what is Kabbage? Kabbage is basically a transaction banking platform, right? And so what Kabbage has, Kabbage does short-term loans. It does working capital loans. It will do merchant financing loans. It has a transaction banking account. It has a debit card attached to it, and we have our American Express card attached to that. So we have a very different philosophy as it relates to small businesses where the commitment of capital, the commitment of of cash that we have to put out and the commitment from a loan perspective will be much smaller and be much more diffused across the entire SME base. 
And so we believe it's a sweet spot for us, and that was the Kabbage piece of it. We did not believe that transaction banking was a sweet spot for us from an S&P 500 and above. And we're really thrilled to be partnering with Goldman on this."

And in a lot of ways, things have stayed the same. I'm curious, when you look forward, what do you think is different about the business as we emerge from the COVID crisis? Is it the demographic of your customer? Is it the expansion with Kabbage? What's going to be different in the next 3 years because of what we've seen in the last year?"

And that was because we really focused on a lot of this value proposition enhancement. And one of the reasons that I started my remarks today with sort of pre pandemic, at the pandemic and during the pandemic was to show that this was a bit of a continuum here, right? When you think about this, what we talked about a number of years ago was really focusing in on our customers, focusing in on refreshing our products and services, becoming more digitally engaged and expanding that organic core of products and services. 
And what I think what we saw during the pandemic here was that we saw an accelerant as it related to online. Our online spending has accelerated tremendously. I think we're 27% up in  Q3 here. Goods and services, 19% growth over '19. And so we've been able to direct our card members in ways faster than we probably would have gotten there without the pandemic. And again, I think looking at our overall strategy of refreshing these card products has led us to expanding our overall base. 
As we expand the value propositions, I mean look, we're talking about over 70% millennial and Gen Z acquisition in a Platinum Card, where we just raised the feet of $695. So it's obviously speaking to that base. And I think that's one of the things we've seen over this time period is how much more we are speaking to that customer segment. And so when you put that all together and you add the SME piece of it, which is a complete expansion with Kabbage, is that we're opening up a lot more doors for us to do business with our SME customers. 
And one of the things we've learned is that the more products that you have with your customer, the higher retention rates that you have, obviously, the more revenue that you have and the more engagement that you have. And so I think we've probably driven faster to where we thought we were going to get ultimately as a result of the pandemic but we haven't fundamentally changed where we were going. And that's why I wanted to start this conversation this morning with this is a continuum for us. But again, like we've talked about in the environment, online has been accelerated probably 3 years from a macroeconomic perspective. And I think we're seeing our strategy that we were looking to continually to implement, that has been accelerated and it's proven to be right."

And so with that playing field expanded, that's why you're seeing this broader marketing spend because you have more customers to go after. You have more archetypes now that you can go after than you did probably 3 or 4 years ago because the product is speaking to a broader set of consumers out there now, broader in terms of the demographic and broader in terms of age and so forth and wants and needs. The products are getting -- all getting broader and a product can now appeal to multiple customer sets. And you're seeing differentiation between the products. It's just not an upgrade. 
When you look at the Gold versus the Platinum, there is specific differences here that speak to another different consumer or different small business customers. So I think that has probably changed as well."

But it is -- we think from a 13% growth perspective, we are probably growing at or above market at this particular point in time. But when we look at this, what is down from an SME perspective is T&E. So you are seeing a conversion of check or cash or wire to card. And I think we saw that during the pandemic. And I think that's where some of the investment in sort of our AP automation has helped as well. 
And when you talk about B2B spending, approximately 80% of SME spending is B2B spending. Maybe 85% of SME spending is B2B spending. And they use it for lots of different things. There's some inventory management. But remember, our SME base is so broad and it's professional services, lawyers, HVAC, so forth and so on. And so they do use -- look, they do use the product for goods for resale as well. I mean it's -- auto glass companies use it to buy auto glass. And plumbers use it to buy supplies and so forth and so on. And you're probably seeing a little bit more cash conversion. But we're pretty pleased with that 13% number of growth plus with the [ T&E ] component of that being down."

Well, they feverishly look for that answer, Lisa, as it's sitting around the table with me. But as far as the first part, look, millennials and Gen Zs are about experiences and they're about access. And I can speak for experience having a household of them. And so they love to travel. They love to do things. And when you look at the Platinum Card product, which had always been positioned as, ""Hey, I'm a real high spender. I need to have that Platinum Card product,"" you have to look at the utility of this product. And you look at fine hotels and resorts, and you look at the value that you get out of a fine hotel and resort booking with an early check-in and a late checkout and a free breakfast at $100 credit at the hotel. 
And then you look at streaming credits. They're online shoppers. There's rewards accelerators. There's travel credits. There's access to tickets, there's access to special card member events. It is a range of services that they use. And look, Equinox is another benefit that we put on. And look, we just added Walmart Plus membership, which a majority of our platinum card hold to shop at Walmart, and we think this is a great benefit as well. 
So when they look at this product, it really is a lifestyle product for them, one that ranges from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming all the way to traveling and the credits they get, whether it's global entry and TSA premium and all those kinds of things. So it is a wide-ranging value-rich product for these younger people and older people like myself. But basically, out of this particular cohort, it's 27% of our overall spending. And in the third quarter, that grew 38%. So we feel pretty good about that as we move in. So that's the -- I think that gives you the answer to your second question."

And then we added LoungeBuddy, which is a lounge finder, which provides our card members not only with access to our Centurion lounges but other relationships that we have over 1,200 lounges and it'll also give them perspective on if our lounge user are full or not. Then we bought Meiz and we bought Cake and a few others and then, obviously, Kabbage. So look, we're constantly looking in -- acompay we bought as well. 
So we're constantly looking for those bolt-on acquisitions, things that will continue to drive our overall organic core and make our overall product set better. Some of the things are -- obviously, the prices for fintech is -- are, obviously -- some of these things are very highly valued, and obviously, the math doesn't work. But the way we've looked at it is if something makes strategic sense overall, then we'll look at doing it. But I think the big thing for us is we have a feeder system with Amex Ventures where we have probably investments in 40-plus, 50 different entities right now. And it gives us an opportunity to test drive them. It gives us an opportunity to learn. And through some of these investments, it led to us acquiring companies down the road. 
So look, you never say never about anything, and that's probably as far as I'm going to go. But we're always interested in things that are going to be accretive to the company overall."

People don't use our card to buy stock, and I don't think people are going to use our card anytime soon to buy crypto. So I don't see that as a big role. 
Having said that, within closed ecosystems of NFTs and stablecoins and things like that, you see it. I mean we're on NBA Top Shot. You can use the card there, and there's a few other places where you can use the card, and we'll see how that all plays out. I think there are opportunities down the  road potentially membership rewards and things like that as redemption options. But I don't see at this point and I don't foresee it at any point where cryptocurrency is going to be a threat to traditional credit card payments. And there's a lot of reasons for that. There's -- obviously, there's rewards. There's service. There is the ability to dispute and there's also the ability to extend credit. 
So there's always a role, I think as I get asked this question, is it going to displace traditional credit cards. And I think the answer to that is no. I think there is a role, though, for digital currencies. I think it can make cross-border payments, a lot more seamless and a lot easier to conduct.

But I think what I would say is that when we see -- what we've seen from a value proposition injection perspective last year, we saw a lot of that stuff stick. So we saw more card members putting wireless on. We sold more card members putting streaming services on, and that has continued to flow through. We've seen more of our card members putting online spending on. So I think that our belief is that's going to stick. 
And when you look at sort of goods and services growth, it's 19% over 2019. It's 18% over 2020. So it has been consistent. So that -- I think that's here to stay. And I think what will happen is we'll get that travel. The other thing I would say is we talked about the millennial cohort before, and that being up 38%, our boomers are not back. And so the majority of our traditional card base is not back yet. And that is not growing at 38%. But the reality is they will come back and they will come back as they feel more safe and.

At some point, that level of uncertainty is going to decrease down to 0. And at some point, those reserves being held for that have to also go pretty much down to 0. Now -- so that's got to happen probably mostly over the course of next year. 
On the other hand, as loan growth begins to pick back up, which it has in the last quarter, as delinquencies start to drift up, I don't think they're going to spike up, but they'll drift up a little bit, then the actual what I'm going to call BAU part of your provision is going to start direct out. What's really hard to predict, though, Sanjay, is the relative pace of those 2 things next year. 
What I feel very confident, though, in pointing out, as I did a few minutes ago, is that relative to this year where you've had billions of dollars that have led you to a net benefit on the provision line, I certainly don't expect that next year, which is why we feel pretty good about the confidence in the range we've given, given that it actually represents several billions of dollars of improved business performance from a pre-provision perspective.

The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. 
We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, to start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion, up 25% over last year's third quarter and earnings per share of $2.27. These strong results once again r",1372,"Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. 
Earlier today, we reported third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion, up 25% over last year's third quarter and earnings per share of $2.27. These strong results once again reflect accelerating momentum in our core business as billings on our network reached record highs for the third quarter driven by goods and services spending.  
In my remarks this morning, I want to put into context the decisions that we've made pre pandemic, when the pandemic hit and during the pandemic to drive the growth we are now seeing and the increased confidence we now have in our business model. In 2018, we introduced a new financial growth algorithm, which call for high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. 
Prior to the pandemic, we achieved those objectives for 10 straight quarters through focused and increased investment levels in our business. We executed strategies for profitably growing the business, which were based on initiatives to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers in both our consumer and commercial businesses.  
And while our differentiated business model gave us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities we saw, we also knew that the favorable economic conditions we had at the time could change. So we also developed a plan for winning through the down cycle that focused on protecting our customers and our colleagues in maintaining our capital strength, while investing strategically and at the right time to rebuild momentum, so we could win during the recovery.  
Through it all, the driving force behind everything we do from product innovations to our investments decisions is to continue to make the American Express brand special and back our customers. 
Over the last several years, we focused our strategies on broadening the appeal of core products to attract new customers, particularly millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our leadership position with SME customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. 
To accomplish those objectives, we made a series of investments, and I'll highlight a few. We put in place a strategy for consistently refreshing our core premium products, adding value with expanded and relevant new benefits targeted at key consumer and small business customers, and we charge for that added value. 
We added a host of new digital capabilities for consumers and small businesses and expanded and enhanced our mobile app to appeal to the digital lifestyles of our target customers. We're an early mover in launching our buy now pay later capability, Pay It Plan It, which we introduced to address the evolving borrowing preferences of our customers.  
We increased our focus on working with strategic partners to help us enrich our value propositions, expand our network and broaden our digital capabilities and offerings. For example, we negotiated wide-ranging long-term agreements with key co-brand partners such as Delta, Hilton and Amazon. 
We also expanded partnerships with digital giants such as PayPal and added a variety of new partners to our ecosystem, including fintechs, such as Bill.com and Better and lifestyle brands such as Equinox. We achieved virtual parity coverage in the U.S., and we increased coverage internationally through a more targeted approach, while increasing the number of compelling offers and benefits that our merchants deliver to our card members.  
When the pandemic hit unexpectedly in early 2020, we responded by activating our plan for winning through the cycle using the same customer-focused approach to concentrate on retaining our customers and addressing their immediate needs. We moved quickly to enhance and expand our financial relief programs to assist our customers who suddenly face financial hardships. 
Our frontline servicing team stepped up to ensure we continue to provide the world-class service our customers have come to expect from American Express. We pivoted the value propositions of several of our premium products, adding temporary benefits on categories that were relevant to how customer spending behaviors have changed, such as wireless, streaming, food delivery and others. 
This has produced lasting behavioral changes, as spending in a number of these categories, including wireless and streaming, has proven to be sustainable. Soon after, we turned our attention to small businesses who needed help by launching the largest global small business campaign in the company's history, creating the Stand for Small coalition and supporting minority-owned small businesses in the United States.  
As last year progressed, we learned from our customers what resonated with them in this unprecedented environment, and we grew more confident to seize the growth opportunities we saw emerging. So we revved up our investments in Card Member acquisitions and value proposition innovations to capitalize on those opportunities and start rebuilding of our growth momentum.  
We also saw an opportunity to accelerate our strategy to bring new digital beyond the card capabilities to our small business customers and acquired Kabbage, one of the leading providers of digital cash management platforms. 
Importantly, the increasing demand we are seeing for our products and what we learn from the early value proposition enhancements encouraged us to restart our product refresh strategy last year. And in July, we launched our new Consumer Platinum Card in the U.S. 
We're repeating this customer-led product innovation strategy with the refresh of the U.S. Business Platinum card, which we launched last week. As with the Consumer Card refresh, the new benefits we added to our Business Platinum and key spend categories such as electronics, software, shipping, wireless and others were informed by our card member desires.  
Coming into 2021, we were emboldened by the strong results we were seeing toward the end of 2020 from our customer retention and acquisition efforts, and we decided to double down our investments in marketing, product innovations, technology and people to accelerate our growth momentum. 
All these decisions, those that we made before the pandemic. when the pandemic hit and through this year as conditions begin to improve, are driving the results we're seeing today. For example, customer acquisitions have gained momentum over the last 5 quarters, with 2.6 million new cards in force in the third quarter. 
Demand for our premium fee-based products has been particularly robust, with acquisitions of our U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold Cards reaching all-time highs in the quarter. In consumer, millennial and Gen Z customers have driven this growth with 75% of new U.S. Gold and Platinum Consumer Cards coming from these customers. In commercial, we had one of the best quarters ever, the U.S. Small Business Cards acquisitions.  
Our focus on meeting the needs of SMEs and millennial and Gen Z consumer customers has resulted in these groups being the most resilient throughout the pandemic, leading to growth in spending. In fact, spending from these groups continued to accelerate in the third quarter, with goods and services spending from SMEs growing 21% above 2019 levels. And overall spending for millennial and Gen Z customers, particularly strong, up 38% over 2019 levels.  
Our initiatives to protect our customers at the beginning of the pandemic has driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than pre pandemic levels, and the digital capabilities we've introduced have driven steady increases in digital engagement. For example, approximately 85% of active card members are digitally engaged with us, and we had the highest ever daily active user engagement across the web and mobile in August with a nearly 17% increase year-over-year.  
As these examples show the strategies we implemented to profitably grow our business before the pandemic began, coupled with the decisions we made in executing our strategy to manage through the pandemic and to win during a recovery, have generated strong, consistent momentum as the environment continues to improve. And what we've learned through this past year is informing our strategy for investing to profitably grow our business moving forward.  
Looking ahead, we're operating from a position of strength, and we see even more opportunities to build on the momentum we've created. So we will continue to invest strategically in seeking to drive even higher levels of sustainable long-term revenue and EPS growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss our third quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Thank you."
92001,1682652769,2409873,"American Express Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke about. You see this momentum",2746,"Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke about. 
You see this momentum in our summary financials on Slide 2, with third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis; third quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.27. 
To get right into a more detailed look at our results, let's talk about how the strategies that Steve just discussed have helped to drive our volumes back above pre pandemic levels, as you can see on Slide 3. You will notice in the several views of volumes that begin on Slide 3 that we continue to show third quarter volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, as we find this provides a clearer picture of the progress we are making in building growth momentum. 
We did see continued momentum in spending volumes in the third quarter, with total network volumes and billed business volumes both up around 30% year-over-year and up 4% relative to 2019 on an FX-adjusted basis. 
This growth in billed business is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which you can see on Slide 4 represents 79% of our overall business and was up 19% versus 2019 and strengthened sequentially versus Q2. 
We are very pleased with this continued strength in goods and services spending given the investments we've made in premium card member engagement, prospect acquisition, growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners.  
Focusing in first on our consumer business on Slide 5. Overall spending was 9% above 2019 levels as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 20% above 2019 in the third quarter. For many years, we've been focused on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities. 
Aided by these efforts, you see that millennials and Gen Z customers are leading the growth in spending, reaching 38% above 2019 levels for the quarter, while older age cohorts have shown continued steady though smaller improvement as well.  
Turning to our commercial business. As you know, we've been very focused on helping our small and medium-sized enterprise clients run their business by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs. This strategic focus on SMEs has been key in driving the performance you see on Slide 6.  
Global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the most resilient across all of our customer types, with spending up 11% versus 2019 driven by strong growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which grew 21% above 2019 levels in Q3. 
In contrast, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We've said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.  
Digging into goods and services spending trends on Slide 7. We continue to see strong growth in online and card not present spending, which was up 27% versus 2019, even as offline spending fully recovered in the third quarter, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. 
We also saw growth across all categories of goods and services spending, with both consumer and SMEs driving the strong growth in retail and wholesale spending, and SMEs leading the growth in advertising and media spending.  
Turning now to T&E spending on Slide 8. You continue to see a recovery that is on track with our expectation that we'll reach 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. T&E spending improved sequentially versus Q2, and we're pleased to see restaurant spending, our most resilient and now largest T&E category, back above pre pandemic levels in the quarter. 
We did see some modest impacts from the Delta variant in the airline category, where the pace of recovery slowed a bit in August, but it has strengthened again in September and into early October.  
The trends we have seen reinforce our view. The travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies. And we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel.  
Turning to our last look at volumes on Slide 9. You do see that the overall billed business volume recovery continues to be led by the U.S., which first surpassed 2019 levels in Q2 and was up 9% in the third quarter. 
Importantly, though, growth in goods and services spending has been strong both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spending is only weaker outside the U.S. because, historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions, and international T&E is recovering more slowly than in the U.S. given cross-border travel restrictions.  
Looking ahead, based on current trends, we still assume that overall T&E spending globally will recover to around 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even more importantly, we expect continued strong growth momentum in goods and services spending. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes.  
Moving on then to the receivable and loan balances on Slide 10. Loan balances continued to slowly recover in the third quarter and were up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Relative to 2019 though, loan balances remain down 10% as we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. 
I would point out that we have hit an inflection point on revolving loan balances. We know it will take time for those balances to rebuild as paydown rates are likely to remain elevated in the near term. We believe, over the long term, we can get back to growing our loan volumes faster than the industry. For the next few quarters, though, I continue to expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes.  
Turning next to credit and provision on Slides 11 through 13. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance, with Card Member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. 
As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time. However, given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off rates in the next few quarters.  
This strong credit performance, combined with further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, drove $191 million provision expense benefit in the third quarter, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release as shown on Slide 12. 
That said, we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off and that there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment. In addition, we are closely monitoring how the card members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, though the early performance of the card members that have exited these programs has looked quite strong.  
As you see on Slide 13, we ended the quarter -- third quarter with $3.6 billion of reserves, representing 4.5% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively, which is only slightly below the reserve levels we had pre pandemic. So given that our credit metrics are still around historical lows, I would say that we continue to hold an appropriately significant amount of reserves driven by the remaining uncertainties I just spoke about.  
Moving next to revenues on Slide 14. Total revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. We had double-digit growth in all of our noninterest revenue lines, and we are starting to see growth in net interest income as well. 
Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the third quarter primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we are beginning to see, though they still remain well below 2019 levels.  
Turning to our largest revenue line discount revenue on Slide 15. You see it grew 33% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis and is now comfortably above 2019 levels. This growth is primarily driven by the steady momentum in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters.  
Net card fee revenues continued to grow as consistently as they have throughout the entire pandemic, up 27% year-over-year in the third quarter. These card fee revenues are now 27% higher than they were back in the third quarter of 2019, as you can see on Slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers.  
Turning to net interest income on Slide 17. You can see that it was up 6% year-over-year. Though still growing slower relative to the other revenue lines, we have clearly hit an inflection point. This growth is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs into higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. 
We did see a modest sequential improvement in revolving loan balances in the third quarter. But looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes.  
So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q3, as you can see on Slide 18, with revenue up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Looking forward, with the strength in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year, we now assume that full year revenue growth could be around 15% if current trends continue.
The revenue momentum we've seen this year has clearly been accelerated as a result of the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, technology and people, and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. 
Let me start at the bottom with operating expenses, which were up 3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Looking forward, I still expect our full year OpEx to be below the $11.5 billion we originally expected, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses, while also investing in technology and our people to drive long-term growth in our business.  
Moving on to variable customer engagement expenses at the top of Slide 19. There are a few things to think about. Most importantly, in 2020, we added some incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions. 
The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing investment line and are now winding down. We are able to wind them down because our customers are again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, which is a good thing in terms of longer-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does however mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs.  
As one example of the financial implications of customers again engaging in travel-related aspects of our Membership Rewards program, in the rewards line, we made a roughly $200 million adjustment this quarter to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. Looking forward, as I've said the past few quarters, I'd expect these variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 40% of total revenues.  
Turning next to the marketing investments we're making to build growth momentum. You can see on Slide 20 that we invested $1.4 billion in marketing in the third quarter, as we continued to ramp up new card acquisition, while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.6 million new cards, up 87% year-over-year and 6% sequentially in the third quarter. 
Much more importantly though than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from new acquisitions and revenues from this quarter's acquisitions are trending stronger than what we saw pre pandemic.  
One key driver of this performance is the great demand for our premium fee-based products, with new accounts acquired on these products more than doubling year-over-year and representing 65% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. In particular, acquisitions of new U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Global Card members were at all-time highs this quarter, and this was again one of the best quarters for small business new account acquisitions in the U.S.  
Based on the opportunities we've seen in the first 3 quarters of 2021, we now expect to invest over $5 billion in marketing for the year. We feel really good about the results we've seen from our strategic investments and see an opportunity to continue to invest during the recovery to maximize sustainable long-term growth.  
Turning next to capital on Slide 21. Our CET1 ratio was 12.6% at the end of the third quarter, which declined from the prior quarter, but remained above our target ratio of 10% to 11%. In the quarter, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, including common stock purchases of $3.3 billion and $337 million in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation. 
Looking forward, we expect our CET1 ratio to migrate to our target range over the next few quarters, as we continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we hold and generate, while supporting balance sheet growth.  
So let's close by talking about what the signs and momentum we saw in the first 3 quarters of this year might mean for the future. As a reminder, we started the year with a wide range of scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021, as we did not know how the medical and economic environment would evolve during the year and the impact it would have, most importantly on our credit reserves.  
Now 3 quarters into the year, the macro outlook has steadily improved, and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. We've already released $2.3 billion of reserves, accounting for over $2 of EPS year-to-date. That still leaves us however with a lot of reserves due to the remaining uncertainties I spoke about earlier. 
So our updated scenario 1 on Slide 22 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical environment and economic outlook does not improve further and that we therefore don't release any additional credit reserves this year. That could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $8.90 per share.  
Our updated scenario 2 in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance, as the remaining stimulus and forbearance programs roll off, and that we also see continued improvement in the economic outlook leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood a lower level of credit reserves. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $9.50.  
In closing, we feel really good about the progress we've made this year as a result of our investments in marketing, value propositions, technology and our people. And as the year has gone on, we've gotten even more confident in our ability to deploy significant resources towards building sustainable long-term growth momentum. 
Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had for 2020 in 2022 and to continue to drive towards higher levels of sustainable growth over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian."

Provisions were going to be in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range versus, where I look now, losses are running sub-1, and you noted you don't expect them to move up that much for the next few quarters. 
So can you maybe just, one, Jeff, talk about some of the puts and takes that -- such that you wouldn't be above the high end given how much leverage you have from credit? And then second, Steve, maybe you could expand on the comment that Jeff made to continue to invest to maximize the long-term growth that can help you sustain the financial algorithm that you laid out at the beginning of the call."

So we see that as a pretty impressive grow over to in fact be confident in getting to the high end of where we originally thought we'd be in 2020 next year. Considering the magnitude of that grow-over, considering that it's not reliant on a full recovery across all of our businesses, we actually see tailwinds that probably will help us in '22 and into 2023. 
And that's why, as I turn it over to Steve, I think we are so emboldened by the progress we've seen bringing new people into the franchise, Ryan, that we think we have an opportunity here to continue to invest significant resources to drive longer term, even higher levels of sustainable growth."

But we're not governed by what level we think we should or what anybody thinks we should hit. We're governed by the fact that there are tremendous opportunities out there. 
And when you look at what is going on sort of what our acquisition activity is right now, look, we brought in 2.6 million cardholders. And what we really focus on is what revenue those cardholders really bring in. And what we're seeing is we're seeing a cardholder base that is spending more than we're bringing in, that has a better FICO profile, and it's skewing millennial and it's skewing fee pay.  
And so as we run our models, we'll be governed by can we continue to acquire these card members, and we are. And the reality is that, and I said this from day 1, we're running this for the long -- the medium to long term. And the reality is if we continue to find those great opportunities in the consumer base, in the SME base, in some opportunities beyond the card that we might have, we'll continue to invest.  
So as we look at it right now, our plan is to continue to be aggressive with our investments constrained by our investment return models, not constrained by a certain level that people think we should or should not be at. And that's just the way we've been running the business for the last few years, and we'll continue to do that. 
And I think it's really served us well during the pandemic. I don't think you would have thought that this year we would have spent that kind of money. And -- but I think the key point is we're spending that money to grow the business profitably. We're not spending that money because we're in some battle to keep up with the Joneses here, okay?"

So that's what has driven our marketing spend now, including value injection to over $5 billion this year, much higher than Steve and I started the year thinking it would be. And as we think about 2022, we're very confident in the kind of EPS outcome that we've been talking about. 
But the ultimate amount of marketing that goes with that is going to be a function of the attractive opportunities. And because we're getting such great growth from the spending, as Steve talked about, we're actually generating more revenue from the dollars that we're investing in marketing than we were pre pandemic. 
The marketing starts to become a little self-funding, while still hitting our EPS targets if the opportunities are there. So that's what's going to drive us in terms of how much marketing we do next year."

So in terms of -- maybe just talking about it at a little bit of a higher level, right. In terms of competition, I understand that American Express has always played in a very competitive market for many years. 
Maybe talk about the dimensions of the competition. Have they changed post competition? Are you seeing different players? And also just in terms of your marketing and customer acquisition spending, how is it different today than it was maybe pre pandemic, like in 2019? Is there -- are you making investments in different things? Are customers asking for different things?"
92001,1682652769,2409873,"American Express Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","American Express Company","Executives","So look, the only time I'd say competition sort of ramped down was during the pandemic when nobody was really acquiring a lot of cards. But when we look at the range of competitors, you have to realize that we're looking at competitors on a global basis,",814,"So look, the only time I'd say competition sort of ramped down was during the pandemic when nobody was really acquiring a lot of cards. But when we look at the range of competitors, you have to realize that we're looking at competitors on a global basis, country by country. 
We're looking at competitors across Corporate Card, Small Business and Consumer Cards. And I think as we talk to -- quite honestly, as we talk to you guys about competition, where the drive tends to be is consumer competition in the U.S. And the reality is that this has been a competitive market since the financial crisis. 
I mean, I think the Consumer Card competition really heated up after the financial crisis when the big money center banks decided to really get serious about their Consumer Card business. And a lot of them have done a really good job, and we compete very vigorously with them.
And so I don't really think it -- in my mind, I don't think it's changed all that much. I think it paused a little bit during the pandemic, but I don't think it's changed at all. 
The other thing that I would say is there are a range of other competitors out there, fintechs and what have you. And we continue to watch them, whether it's competitors in the corporate card space, competitors in other places. 
From a buy now pay later perspective, that's not really a big competitive threat to us. I mean, when you think about buy now pay later, it tends to be targeted at low FICO. It tends to be targeted at a lot of debit card users. It's used as a customer acquisition vehicle, and that's just not the game that we're playing. 
We've had a buy now pay later product since 2017, and it's just another way for our card members to manage their spending within the overall American Express relationship. It's a transaction-by-transaction management tool, which, quite honestly, is a lot more flexible than point-of-sale buy now pay later because you don't know who's going to actually have point-of-sale at every merchant you go to. 
And then for the [ paying for people ], which is also another thing that's out there, which is a version of buy now pay later, there, actually, our charge card product gives you more float and gives you rewards.  
So -- but you have to look at all this stuff, whether it's whoever is coming into the space. So we look at competitors all the time, and you have to evaluate how it attacks your customer base. But I think the way we run this business, and you've seen this over decades, is we continually to put more value and build a bigger moat around our customers, and just look at what we've done with the Platinum Card here. 
We refreshed this product, while it was going gangbusters, both of them. We were at record levels of Platinum acquisition before the refresh. And yet, we went out and refreshed and went out and raised the fee. 
And how can you do that? Because you're adding more value, both on the consumer side and both on the small business side. And so, look, in the third quarter, we have record levels of not only Gold and -- not only Platinum, but Gold Card acquisition for our base. So we feel really good about that.  
I think as far as how you spend your money, look, we do -- obviously, the industry has changed. You do a lot less direct mail than you used to do. You do -- there's a lot more sort of aggregator acquisition. But I think what's really important about us, and as we look at our marketing spend, we look at our marketing spend not only for prospect marketing, but we invest in our customers. 
And we spend marketing money on our customers to continue to grow their spend, to upgrade their product, to introduce them to our lending capabilities, and it creates a flywheel, right, because what you do is you bring these prospects in and then you manage these prospects and get them to become more and more profitable.  
And one of the things that we hang our hat on is we look at our customers as a platform for growth. And if you can continue to do more and more with your customers, they will generate more revenue. You'll have more loyalty, and you're seeing that. You're seeing that in our retention metrics. 
And so we really look at our marketing spend. It's not just acquisition. It's also with our existing customer base. So -- and that's probably changed a little bit more over the years as we've invested more and more on our customers as our -- as the product set that we have continues to expand."

And look, we have relationships with 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. And when we compete, as we compete, sometimes, we compete with other money center banks that have corporate card programs and also have transaction banking, and they tend to integrate that. 
And so Goldman is very interested in getting into transaction banking, not as necessarily as interested in getting into the corporate card. We do a number of things with Goldman Sachs. 
From a customer perspective, they are a customer of ours. We're a customer of theirs. And as John and David and I were talking about things, it looked like a really good opportunity. They were trying to ramp up their transaction banking. We have the corporate card. And putting those things together in that space, a space that we really weren't going to get into transaction banking as related to large banks, it's not -- it's just not our space, okay? Corporate Card is, but not transaction banking.  
So we've decided to look at the top 250. And if that goes well, and there's no reason why it will not go well, then we can put it a little bit more downstream to, say, the S&P 500. 
We have a different perspective as it relates to the SMB space, which is why, if you remember, what we've talked about from an SMB perspective is we wanted to be the working capital providers for our small businesses. And now in the small business space, we have a very good footprint not only in the United States, but good footprints in internationally. 
You also remember during the pandemic, we bought Kabbage. And what is Kabbage? Kabbage is basically a transaction banking platform, right? And so what Kabbage has, Kabbage does short-term loans. It does working capital loans. It will do merchant financing loans. It has a transaction banking account. It has a debit card attached to it, and we have our American Express card attached to that. 
So we have a very different philosophy as it relates to small businesses where the commitment of capital, the commitment of cash that we have to put out and the commitment from a loan perspective will be much smaller and be much more diffused across the entire SME base.  
And so we believe it's a sweet spot for us, and that was the Kabbage piece of it. We did not believe that transaction banking was a sweet spot for us from an S&P 500 and above. And we're really thrilled to be partnering with Goldman on this."

So since the constraints from the Fed were lifted, while we don't want to disrupt the market, we did buy more aggressively. I think you will continue to see us buy above, what I will call, a steady-state level for -- and our steady-state level is pretty high as a company with a 30% ROE.

And one of the reasons that I started my remarks today with sort of pre pandemic, at the pandemic and during the pandemic was to show that this was a bit of a continuum here, right? When you think about this, what we talked about a number of years ago was really focusing in on our customers, focusing in on refreshing our products and services, becoming more digitally engaged and expanding that organic core of products and services. 
And what I think what we saw during the pandemic here was that we saw an accelerant as it related to online. Our online spending has accelerated tremendously. I think we're 27% up in Q3 here. Goods and services, 19% growth over '19. 
And so we've been able to direct our card members in ways faster than we probably would have gotten there without the pandemic. And again, I think, looking at our overall strategy of refreshing these card products has led us to expanding our overall base. 
As we expand the value propositions, I mean, look, we're talking about over 70% millennial and Gen Z acquisition in a Platinum Card, where we just raised the fee to $695. So it's obviously speaking to that base, and I think that's one of the things we've seen over this time period is how much more we are speaking to that customer segment. 
And so when you put that all together and you add the SME piece of it, which is a complete expansion with Kabbage, is that we're opening up a lot more doors for us to do business with our SME customers. And one of the things we've learned is that the more products that you have with your customer, the higher retention rates that you have, obviously, the more revenue that you have and the more engagement that you have. 
And so I think we've probably driven faster to where we thought we were going to get ultimately as a result of the pandemic, but we haven't fundamentally changed where we were going. And that's why I wanted to start this conversation this morning with this is a continuum for us. 
But again, like we've talked about in the environment, online has been accelerated probably 3 years from a macroeconomic perspective. And I think we're seeing our strategy that we were looking to continually to implement, that has been accelerated, and it's proven to be right."

And so with that playing field expanded, that's why you're seeing this broader marketing spend because you have more customers to go after. You have more archetypes now that you can go after than you did probably 3 or 4 years ago because the product is speaking to a broader set of consumers out there now, broader in terms of the demographic and broader in terms of age and so forth and wants and needs. 
The products are getting -- all getting broader, and a product can now appeal to multiple customer sets. And you're seeing differentiation between the products. It's just not an upgrade. When you look at the Gold versus the Platinum, there is specific differences here that speak to another -- a different consumer or a different small business customer.

But it is -- we think from a 13% growth perspective, we are probably growing at or above market at this particular point in time. 
But when we look at this, what is down from an SME perspective is T&E. So you are seeing a conversion of check or cash or wire to card. And I think we saw that during the pandemic. And I think that's where some of the investment in sort of our AP automation has helped as well. 
And when you talk about B2B spending, approximately 80% of SME spending is B2B spending. Maybe 85% of SME spending is B2B spending, and they use it for lots of different things. There's some inventory management. But remember, our SME base is so broad. And it's professional services, lawyers, HVAC, so forth and so on. 
And so they do use -- look, they do use the product for goods for resale as well. I mean, it's -- auto glass companies use it to buy auto glass.

So when they look at this product, it really is a lifestyle product for them, one that ranges from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming, all the way to traveling and the credits they get, whether it's global entry and TSA premium, all those kinds of things. 
So it is a wide-ranging, value-rich product for these younger people and older people like myself. But basically, out of this particular cohort, it's 27% of our overall spending. And in the third quarter, that grew 38%. So we feel pretty good about that as we move in. So that's the -- I think that gives you the answer to your second question."

And then we added LoungeBuddy, which is a lounge finder, which provides our card members not only with access to our Centurion Lounges, but other relationships that we have over 1,200 lounges. And it'll also give them perspective on if our lounge user are full or not. Then we bought Mezi, and we bought Cake and a few others and then, obviously, Kabbage. 
So look, we're constantly looking in -- and acompay, we bought as well. So we're constantly looking for those bolt-on acquisitions, things that will continue to drive our overall organic core and make our overall product set better. 
And some of the things are -- obviously, the prices for fintech is -- are obviously -- some of these things are very highly valued. And obviously, the math doesn't work. But the way we've looked at it is if something makes strategic sense overall, then we'll look at doing it. 
But I think the big thing for us is we have a feeder system with Amex Ventures, where we have probably investments in 40-plus, 50 different entities right now. And it gives us an opportunity to test drive them. It gives us an opportunity to learn. And through some of these investments, it led to us acquiring companies down the road. 
So look, you never say never about anything, and that's probably as far as I'm going to go. But we're always interested in things that are going to be accretive to the company overall."

And look, there's -- we think about cryptocurrency much more as an asset class at this particular point in time. 
We don't use our card to sort of buy stock. People don't use our card to buy stock, and I don't think people are going to use our card anytime soon to buy crypto. So I don't see that as a big role. 
Having said that, within closed ecosystems of NFTs and stablecoins and things like that, you see it. I mean, we're on NBA Top Shot. You can use the card there. And there's a few other places where you can use the card, and we'll see how that all plays out. 
I think there are opportunities down the road potentially, membership rewards and things like that as redemption options. But I don't see at this point and I don't foresee it in -- at any point where cryptocurrency is going to be a threat to traditional credit card payments, and there's a lot of reasons for that. 
There's -- obviously, there's rewards. There's service. There is the ability to dispute, and there's also the ability to extend credit. So there's always a role. I think -- because I get asked this question, is it going to displace traditional credit cards, and I think the answer to that is no. 
I think there is a role, though, for digital currencies. I think it can make cross-border payments a lot more seamless and a lot easier to conduct. And so we'll see how government digital currencies and other stablecoins play out."

As far as new customer, we're in a lot of new customers we acquired last year, and so same customer sales are driving quite a bit. But we don't -- I don't have that at my fingertips at this point. 
But I think what I would say is that when we see -- what we've seen from a value proposition injection perspective last year, we saw a lot of that stuff stick. So we saw more card members putting wireless on. We saw more card members putting streaming services on, and that has continued to flow through. We've seen more of our card members putting online spending on. So I think that our belief is that's going to stick. 
And when you look at sort of goods and services growth, it's 19% over 2019. It's 18% over 2020. So it has been consistent. So that -- I think that's here to stay. And I think what will happen is we'll get that travel. 
The other thing I would say is we talked about the millennial cohort before, and that being up 38%. Our boomers are not back. And so the majority of our traditional card base is not back yet, and that is not growing at 38%. But the reality is they will come back, and they will come back as they feel more safe. And so we think that's a tailwind for us going forward."

At some point, that level of uncertainty is going to decrease down to 0. And at some point, those reserves being held for that have to also go pretty much down to 0. Now -- so that's got to happen probably mostly over the course of next year. 
On the other hand, as loan growth begins to pick back up, which it has in the last quarter, as delinquencies start to drift up, I don't think they're going to spike up, but they'll drift up a little bit, then the actual, what I'm going to call, BAU part of your provision is going to start to drift up. 
What's really hard to predict, though, Sanjay, is the relative pace of those 2 things next year. What I feel very confident, though, in pointing out, as I did a few minutes ago, is that relative to this year where you've had billions of dollars that have led you to a net benefit on the provision line, I certainly don't expect that next year, which is why we feel pretty good about the confidence in the range we've given, given that it actually represents several billions of dollars of improved business performance from a pre-provision perspective. But those are the dynamics that we think about."
