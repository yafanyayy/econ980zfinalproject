269660,700976946,2225377,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2021",2021-02-26,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to",1050,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance. 
We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. 
Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift 5 years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield and at is a testament to the power of our premium strategy. 
Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution. 
We also completed 2 pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industry-wide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate. 
We enter the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. Looking forward, the following 6 steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next 3 years. Number one, maintain fourth quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan. 
Number two, shift to a double premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double premium locations faster than we drill them. 
Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value. 
Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition. 
Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we're positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix towards double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within 5 years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term. 
And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly. 
Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected. 
Now here's Billy."

Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. Within weeks of publishing our initial",1139,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. 
Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. 
The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production. 
The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations company-wide. 
Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about 3/4 of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. 
Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions in shut-in production as a result of exceptional low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions. 
We finished the year with fourth quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of 5 rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs. 
Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18% and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress the past 5 years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers. 
We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further. On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. 
And we increased our already strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve 0 routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage points now. 
Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past 5 years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date. 
Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in 2 ways: they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation. 
We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost, we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed sustainable power group is working to identify low emissions, power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions. 
Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%. 
Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team, who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities. 
Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved. 
Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts."

Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory. 
Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for. 
Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. 
Our vision is to develop double premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow. 
When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016. 
And here's Tim to review our financial position."
269660,700976946,2225377,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2021",2021-02-26,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra.

EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced CapEx in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year. 
The Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I am pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run. 
The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard and fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward. 
EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance. 
Now let me turn the call back to Bill."

First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double premium investment metrics pave the way for another step change in EOG's returns and future performance. 
Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower cost and lower decline rates than our current inventory. 
And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.

Jeanine, the second part of the question is, I think it's important to know that our Board is very, very committed to returning cash to shareholders. And we -- I think we've demonstrated that certainly over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend. The last 4 years, 146% increase. And then last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. 
In an up cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we're going to continue to work that really, really hard. And then on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're going to be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially a supplemental dividend, potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year, some of those were in our exploration plays, some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. So we've got a lot of great options we're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right  way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders."

We're really looking for plays that are really the new technology we see for the future of horizontal drilling for the most part. These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before.

And while we can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position. 
And then as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play, but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly. As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step change for EOG's performance in the future. 
And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all.

So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last 4 years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's okay to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else did the same thing, the U.S. is back to 1 million barrels a day. And your price war comment, my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship in and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It was E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% okay? How do you define the balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place you were a few years go?"

It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not going to push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we're going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not going to -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market period. And when the market is right, and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time. 
We got a great chart that we put together in Slide #10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the 3-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal, they're worse. If we grow faster than that, the same thing, some of those are not optimal, they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow."

If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi have 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back [indiscernible] production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing [ 9x ] in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow and your share price response, obviously, was terrible.

I think there's 2 elements that we look at really closely, obviously, to determine whether the market is relatively balanced or not. One of them is the inventories.

So we're watching spare capacity, and it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. And so we'll be watching both of those. And we're very definitely committed to not overpressuring the market and working with the market we have to work with and staying disciplined and not trying to push oil or grow oil into an oversupplied market. We're making that commitment. We've always done that. We did it in 2015 and 2016, we didn't grow. We obviously shut-in production last year, and we're staying -- we're maintaining that exit rate this year. So we're very disciplined and we're very cognizant of that. 
Beyond that, when the market is available, we want to run a company to generate the highest total return for the shareholder value. That is always our job.

And then next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide #7, I think it is. It shows that these double premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first 2 years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they are better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time. And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're going to get better every year. We figure out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well, the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality. And we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis, how to get better in every aspect of the company. And so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward."

In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees who personify our unique culture responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance.
We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.
Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift 5 years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy.
Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution.
We also completed 2 pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industry-wide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate.
We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. Looking forward, the following 6 steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next 3 years. Number one, maintain fourth quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan.
Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them.
Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value.
Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition.
Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we're positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix towards double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within 5 years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term.
And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly.
Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected.
Now here's Billy."

Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020.
Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities.
The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production.
The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations company-wide.
Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about 3/4 of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021.
Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions.
We finished the year with fourth quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of 5 rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs.
Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18%, and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress the past 5 years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers.
We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further.
On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020.
Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve 0 routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now.
Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past 5 years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date.
Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in 2 ways: they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation.
We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost; we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions.
Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%.
Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities.
Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved.
Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts."

Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory.
Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for.
Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry.
Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow.
When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016.
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced CapEx in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year.
The Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run.
The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured in February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward.
EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance.
Now let me turn the call back to Bill."

First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium investment metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance.
Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory.
And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.

And then last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we're going to continue to work that really, really hard.
And then on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're going to be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. So we've got a lot of great options.

These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before. So we're investing in very significant potential -- future potential for the company.

And while I can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position.
And then as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly.
As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already-robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future.
And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. And that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we're excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional cover -- color for you guys when we have the information."

I'm afraid that I'm just going to focus on one issue, Bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. And I want to kind of just set this up a little bit. And then my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? Now I know I've gone through some of this before, but I just want to set it up here a little bit. Basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. And I think Saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last 4 years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's okay to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else said the same thing. The U.S. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day.
And your price war comment, my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It's an E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% okay? How do you define a balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place you were a few years ago?"

It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not going to push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we're going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not going to -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not -- we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time.
We got a great chart that we put together in Slide #10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the 3-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow."

So for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi have 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back [ any ] production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing 9x in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible.

So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. And so we'll be watching both of those.

And then next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide #7, I think it is. It shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first 2 years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they're better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time.
And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're going to get better every year. We figure out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality. And we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis how to get better in every aspect of the company. And so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward."

Yesterday's dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment ret",740,"Thanks, Bill. Yesterday's dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in 5 years. 
In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averages $39. 
This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition at double premium. 
The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least 2x the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition of premium 5 years ago. 
Just like we did with our premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. 
A number of innovations, which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. 
Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%. 
To see the impact of our premium returns-focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last 4 years. This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021, that price is just $50, and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well level returns improve. 
The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We more than doubled the dividend over the last 4 years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%. 
But our future financial performance potential is the real price. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. 
We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step-change improvement in EOG's financial performance. 
Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent, and consistency is key. Prioritizing reinvestment in high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year after year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. 
Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent: investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet, followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions. 
Now here's Billy."

The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the Winter Storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a resu",694,"Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the Winter Storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6% mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year despite some potential inflationary pressure as industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation. 
A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving [ derated ] depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad, simply requiring less rig move costs per well and increasing efficiencies like offline cementing. 
The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize the technique we call Super Zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019, and it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost. We have also learned that Super Zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our 5 electric frac fleets. 
However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete 4 more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half, simultaneously pumping on 2 wells while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a Super Zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play, and the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of 4 wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques where we can still utilize this improved completion practice. 
Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reuse pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well costs compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. 
Lease operating expense has also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells 1 lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritized lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experience last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high-grade our lease operators work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations. 
Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year after year on productivity, all powered by innovative ideas generated bottom-up by employees. Each of our active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have -- are homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rolled out company-wide if successful. That's one of the primary reasons our well cost improvements every year are never one silver bullet, but a list of small- to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well costs that result in sustainable cost reduction. 
As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve. 
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent long-term, return-focused strategy for capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, this strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remains sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. 
The shift to premium in 2016 drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins and costs, enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last 4 years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share. Now, an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend, and we remain committed to its sustainability. With the shift to double premium, we're now focused on making another step change improvement, and the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases and the potential for special dividends. 
Since the shift to premium, we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion, with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter. 
A strong balance sheet with low debt has been at the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism, it's about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at bottom-of-cycle prices, whether exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new plays we're working on today, bolt-on acquisitions or companies like the Yates acquisition 5 years ago. 
A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies and other countries unlocking new plays. 
Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured, with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit. 
Now EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million, the special dividend is a meaningful amount while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend, we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in 2 years. 
Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and, of course, our own financial performance. As excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or, at the right time, opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Now here is Bill to wrap up."

First, true to the EOG culture, our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve.

If you look back, our regular dividend has increased 146% since 2017. That's one of our highest priorities. We reduced debt by $2.1 billion. So that set us up to be in a position to now return more cash to the shareholders. 
When we looked at our cash position, we were sitting with $3.4 billion of cash. So returning $600 million at this point in time, as Bill has pointed out, is a significant amount, and it follows through on our long-held plan to return cash to the shareholders. So it's simply following through on what we've been committed to for a long time."

And so you have to put the special dividend in context with our total framework. 
And just a reminder, we've already said this, but our first priority is a sustainable dividend growth. We believe the regular dividend is the absolute best way to give cash back to shareholders. And we certainly are working on that and have worked, we've got a great history of doing that. 
And then the next one is debt reduction, and we've got a little work left to do with that, as Tim noted in his opening remarks. 
Our next options are the special dividend, and certainly in favorable times, what we have right now, those are the things that we are doing. 
And then we'll also -- we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter-cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. 
And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas. Obviously, where we've got a lot of synergy and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. And some of them could be in our new exploration plays where we can capture a very high potential acreage at very low cost. 
And so we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework. And we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're in a dynamic business environment all the time. So it's important to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value."

And every year, the market factors that year -- going into that year will determine our plans. And so we want to be flexible. And we want to be able to -- and we will modify our growth plans to fit those market conditions.

And so by driving down well cost through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in the opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. 
In addition to that, we have 2 other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on, is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments, our exploration effort is really focused on, again, making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low-decline, high-impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. 
And again, regardless of any growth rate, when you're reinvesting in higher-return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base of the company year after year. And that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year."

Over the last few years, we've done a little bit of drilling. It was dominantly kind of leasing, putting some of the acreage together. And then, of course, there was a pullback here in 2020 due to the reduction in capital allocation associated with the downturn in prices and COVID. 
But this year, we are back to drilling multiple prospects. We're at a point where the prospects have started to move at different phases, I would say. We're drilling exploration wells across some of the prospects, across others. We're into more of what I'd call appraisal wells. And we're feeling very confident with where we're at, the results that we're seeing. And we hope to be able to provide some results on that soon."

It's exposing us to a prospect that we think has the opportunity, the potential to be impactful to our company. It -- we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns. 
And what we've -- the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad, where for nearly 20 years we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad. And really, this is a geologic province, a type of play where industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator. And we've developed not only operational procedures, but also some geologic techniques where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns. 
The attractive thing about Australia, again, is not only does it fit into our experience level from operations and a technical perspective, but it has many offtake and oilfield service availability there. And of course, the low cost to entry to and exciting amount of upside in the prospect."

With that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health of the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that. And specifically, when it comes to the special dividend, can you just clarify, is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion in minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for the 2020 maturity and then everything else kind of gets paid out in due time and it kind of needs to be meaningful?

Maybe by the end of the year, that will get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. 
The inventories are dropping. We think there'll be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. 
And then the spare capacity is going fine. It's been extended and drawn out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year. But we believe, again, as demand picks up, that, that spare capacity will be put back online. 
We don't want to give you the data when everything is okay, we'll just have to watch and see it. But certainly, everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market, as oil prices have responded to that, I think it's what we're saying and seeing is not different than what the consensus view is. 
On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low and supply is less. And demand is higher this year than supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year with pretty low inventories. So depending -- obviously, it always depends on the weather on gas.

So -- but there are unique circumstances that allow that to happen for us, and they're more driven by geology in that particular area, but also the access issues on the surface. 
I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through to a 3-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies of being able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to a 2-mile lateral, those kind of things.

Yesterday's dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in 5 years.  
In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. 
Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition to double-premium. The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least 2x the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition to premium 5 years ago.  
Just like we did with our premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. A number of innovations, which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%.  
To see the impact of our premium returns-focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last 4 years. 
This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021, that price is just $50, and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well level returns improve. The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We've more than doubled the dividend over the last 4 years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%.  
But our future financial performance potential is the real prize. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step change improvement in EOG's financial performance.  
Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent. And consistency is key. Prioritizing reinvestment in high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year-after-year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent: investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet, followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions.  
Now here's Billy."
269660,708884606,2275783,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 07, 2021",2021-05-07,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a resu",690,"Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year.  
Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6% mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year despite some potential inflationary pressure as industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation.  
A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move costs per well and increasing efficiencies, like offline cementing. 
The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize a technique we call super zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019. And it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost.  We have also learned that super zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our 5 electric frac fleets.  
However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete 4 more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half, simultaneously pumping on 2 wells while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a super zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play. And the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of 4 wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques, where we can still utilize this improved completion practice.  
Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reuse pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well costs compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. 
Lease operating expense has also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritized lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experience last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high-grade our lease operators' work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations.  
Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year-after-year on productivity, all powered by innovative ideas generated bottom-up by employees. Each of our active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have -- are homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rolled out company-wide if successful. 
That's one of the primary reasons our well cost improvements every year are never one silver bullet but a list of small- to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well cost that result in sustainable cost reduction. As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve.  
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent, long-term, return-focused strategy for capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, this strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remains sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction.  
The shift to premium in 2016 drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins and costs, enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last 4 years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share, now an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability.  
With the shift to double-premium, we're now focused on making another step change improvement. And the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases and the potential for special dividends. Since the shift to premium, we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter.  
A strong balance sheet with low debt has been at the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism, it's about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at bottom-of-cycle prices, whether exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new plays we're working on today, bolt-on acquisitions or companies like the Yates acquisition 5 years ago.  
A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies in other countries unlocking new plays. Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit.  
Now EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million, the special dividend is a meaningful amount while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend, we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in 2 years.  
Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and, of course, our own financial performance. As excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or, at the right time, opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value.  
Now here is Bill to wrap up."

First, true to the EOG culture, our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve. Our decline rate will flatten, our break-even oil price will decline, our margins will expand and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially.  
Second, while our new double-premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement, it represents just one source. We never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower cost. Innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace and will continue to result in even higher returns in the future.  
And finally, our special dividend this quarter, we are demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns.

And then the next one is debt reduction, and we've got a little work left to do with that, as Tim noted in his opening remarks. 
Our next options are the special dividend. And certainly in favorable times, what we have right now, those are the things that we are doing. And then we'll also -- we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter-cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas, obviously where we've got a lot of synergy and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. 
And some of them could be in our new exploration plays, where we can capture a very high-potential acreage at very low cost. And so we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework. And we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Similarly, as we've done over the past few years, we're consistently focused on getting better year-after-year. And so by driving down well cost through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in the opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. 
In addition to that, we have 2 other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on, is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments, our exploration effort is really focused on again making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low-decline, high-impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. 
And again, regardless of any growth rate, when you're reinvesting in higher-return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base of the company year-after-year. And that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year."

And then the Powder River Basin is certainly in early maturing or early growth play. 
So each one of those, we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time and maximize returns.

It -- we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns. And what we've -- the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad, where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad. 
And really, this is a geologic province, a type of play where industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator. And we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques, where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns.

With that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health of the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that. 
And specifically, when it comes to the special dividend, can you just clarify, is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion of minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for the 2023 maturity and then everything else kind of gets paid out in due time and it kind of needs to be meaningful?

It's been a little bouncy on the COVID recovery and oil demand. But we're seeing very steady improvements. I think we're up to maybe 95 million barrel a day demand right now, we think. Maybe by the end of the year, that will get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. The inventories are dropping. And we think there will be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. 
And then the spare capacity is going fine. It's been extended and drawn out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year. But we believe, again as demand picks up, that, that spare capacity will be put back online. We don't want to give you the data when everything is okay. We'll just have to watch and see it. But certainly, everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market, as oil prices have responded to that, I think it's what we're saying and seeing is not different than what the consensus view is. 
On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low and supply is less. And demand is higher this year than supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year with pretty low inventories. So depending -- obviously, it always depends on the weather on gas. And so we'll just have to see how all that turns out. But we're optimistic on gas also."

I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through to a 3-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies of being able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to a 2-mile lateral, those kind of things. And a lot of it does depend on the geology. And as you know, we spend a lot of detailed time working through the geology and how to best approach every single well location we have.

Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to",1042,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance.
We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development costs, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.
Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift 5 years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy.
Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio. Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution.
We also completed 2 pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industry-wide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate.
We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. 
Looking forward, the following 6 steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next 3 years. Number one, maintain fourth quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan.
Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them.
Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value.
Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition.
Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we're positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix towards double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within 5 years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term.
And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly.
Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected.
Now here's Billy."

Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020.Within weeks of publishing our initial 2",1140,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020.
Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further.
What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. 
With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low -- impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production.
The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations company-wide.
Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about 3/4 of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year.
We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions.
We finished the year with fourth quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of 5 rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs.
Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18% and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress in the past 5 years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers.
We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further.
On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve 0 routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now.
Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past 5 years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date.
Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in 2 ways: they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation.
We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost, we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions.
Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%.
Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities.
Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved.
Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts."

Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory.
Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for.
Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry.
Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow.
When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016.
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced CapEx in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year.
The Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run.
The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured on February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward.
EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance.
Now let me turn the call back to Bill."

First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium invested metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance.
Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory.
And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.

And then last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. 
At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we're going to continue to work that really, really hard.
And then on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're going to be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. 
So we've got a lot of great options. We're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders."

So just how do you think about use of cash this year, especially if CapEx is not going to flex? How do you think about building cash for the '23 maturity? Is that above and beyond the $2 billion you mentioned? And how do you balance that against returning cash this year if the strip is right?"

These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before.

And while we can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too greater detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position.
And then as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly.
As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future.
And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. And that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we're excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional cover -- color for you guys when we have the information."

I'm afraid that I'm just going to focus on one issue, Bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. And I want to kind of just set this up a little bit. And then my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? Now I know I've gone through some of this before, but I just want to set it up here a little bit. Basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. And I think Saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last 4 years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why -- when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's okay to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else did the same thing, the U.S. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day.
And your price war comment -- my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It's an E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% okay? How do you define a balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place we were a few years ago?"

It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not going to push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we're going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not going to -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time.
We got a great chart that we put together in Slide #10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the 3-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow."

So for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi had 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back [ any ] production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing 9x in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible. So why is 5% global demand growth for a company with 0.5% global supply okay?"

So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some [indiscernible]. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. 
And so we'll be watching both of those.

Charles, yes, the double premium, we've been building more double premium every year as we get our cost down and improve our well productivity. Last year, it was about 50%. In 2019, it was less than that. So last year, it was about 50%. And this year, our goal is to get it up to 75%, maybe even higher percent as that. And then next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide #7 I think it is, it shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first 2 years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they're better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time.
And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're going to get better every year. We've figured out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality. And we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis how to get better in every aspect of the company. And so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward."

Second question, I think this is probably for Bill. Some of your competitors have decided to formalize the excess cash return framework that once that they have excess free cash after CapEx and paid dividend, they will pay that out.

Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to",1042,"Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees, who personify our unique culture, responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance.
We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development costs, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.
Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift 5 years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy.
Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio. Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution.
We also completed 2 pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industry-wide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate.
We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. 
Looking forward, the following 6 steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next 3 years. Number one, maintain fourth quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan.
Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them.
Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value.
Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition.
Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we're positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix towards double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within 5 years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term.
And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly.
Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected.
Now here's Billy."

Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020.Within weeks of publishing our initial 2",1140,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020.
Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further.
What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. 
With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low -- impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production.
The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations company-wide.
Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about 3/4 of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year.
We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions.
We finished the year with fourth quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of 5 rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs.
Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18% and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress in the past 5 years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers.
We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further.
On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve 0 routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now.
Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past 5 years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date.
Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in 2 ways: they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation.
We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost, we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions.
Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%.
Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities.
Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved.
Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts."

Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory.
Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for.
Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry.
Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow.
When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016.
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced CapEx in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year.
The Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run.
The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured on February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward.
EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance.
Now let me turn the call back to Bill."

First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium invested metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance.
Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory.
And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy.
Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A."

And we -- I think we've demonstrated that certainly, over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend. In the last 4 years, 146% increase. And then last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. 
At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we're going to continue to work that really, really hard.
And then on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're going to be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. 
So we've got a lot of great options. We're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders."

And while we can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too greater detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position.
And then as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly.
As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future.
And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all.

Obviously, the goal is to kind of keep things roughly flat with the 4Q '20 levels of 442,000. You're kind of obviously starting at a lower point in 1Q because of a lot of the storm downtime. Does that imply that we're going to see a bit of a gradual ramp on those volumes to kind of get to the average as we work our way into midyear and second half '21 for the U.S. oil volumes?"

I'm afraid that I'm just going to focus on one issue, Bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. And I want to kind of just set this up a little bit. And then my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? Now I know I've gone through some of this before, but I just want to set it up here a little bit. Basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. And I think Saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last 4 years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why -- when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's okay to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else did the same thing, the U.S. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day.
And your price war comment -- my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It's an E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% okay? How do you define a balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place we were a few years ago?"

It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not going to push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we're going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not going to -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time.
We got a great chart that we put together in Slide #10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the 3-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow."

So for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi had 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back [ any ] production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing 9x in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible. So why is 5% global demand growth for a company with 0.5% global supply okay?"

So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some [indiscernible]. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. 
And so we'll be watching both of those.

And then next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide #7 I think it is, it shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first 2 years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they're better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time.
And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're going to get better every year. We've figured out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality.

Yesterday's dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in 5 years.  
In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. 
Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition to double-premium. The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least 2x the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition to premium 5 years ago.  
Just like we did with our premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. A number of innovations, which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%.  
To see the impact of our premium returns-focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last 4 years. 
This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021, that price is just $50, and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well level returns improve. The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We've more than doubled the dividend over the last 4 years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%.  
But our future financial performance potential is the real prize. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step change improvement in EOG's financial performance.  
Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent. And consistency is key. Prioritizing reinvestment in high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year-after-year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent: investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet, followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions.  
Now here's Billy."

The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a resu",691,"Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm Uri recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year.  
Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6% mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year despite some potential inflationary pressure as industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation.  
A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move costs per well and increasing efficiencies, like offline cementing. 
The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize a technique we call super zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019. And it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost.  We have also learned that super zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our 5 electric frac fleets.  
However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete 4 more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half, simultaneously pumping on 2 wells while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a super zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play. And the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of 4 wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques, where we can still utilize this improved completion practice.  
Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reuse pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well costs compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. 
Lease operating expense has also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritized lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experience last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high-grade our lease operators' work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations.  
Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year-after-year on productivity, all powered by innovative ideas generated bottom-up by employees. Each of our active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have -- are a homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rolled out company-wide if successful. 
That's one of the primary reasons our well cost improvements every year are never one silver bullet but a list of small- to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well cost that result in sustainable cost reduction. As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve.  
Here's Tim to review our financial position."

Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent, long-term, return-focused strategy for capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, this strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remains sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction.  
The shift to premium in 2016 drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins and costs, enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last 4 years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share, now an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability.  
With the shift to double-premium, we're now focused on making another step change improvement. And the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases and the potential for special dividends. Since the shift to premium, we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter.  
A strong balance sheet with low debt has been at the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism, it's about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at bottom-of-cycle prices, whether exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new plays we're working on today, bolt-on acquisitions or companies like the Yates acquisition 5 years ago.  
A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies in other countries unlocking new plays. Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit.  
Now EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million, the special dividend is a meaningful amount while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend, we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in 2 years.  
Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and of course, our own financial performance. As excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or at the right time, opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value.  
Now here is Bill to wrap up."

First, true to the EOG culture, our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve. Our decline rate will flatten, our break-even oil price will decline, our margins will expand and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially.  
Second, while our new double-premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement, it represents just one source. We never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower cost. Innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace and will continue to result in even higher returns in the future.  
And finally, our special dividend this quarter, we are demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns.

And then the next one is debt reduction, and we've got a little work left to do with that, as Tim noted in his opening remarks. 
Our next options are the special dividend. And certainly in favorable times, like we have right now, those are the things that we are doing. And then we'll also -- we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter-cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas, obviously where we've got a lot of synergy and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. 
And some of them could be in our new exploration plays, where we can capture a very high-potential acreage at very low cost. And so we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework. And we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

I guess, my first question is kind of to dovetail on the special dividend talk. Bill, this year, you've guided to $3.4 billion in free cash flow, $1.5 billion for dividends, another $750 million for debt you've already paid down. So that leaves a little bit more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow. And I know you're above your minimal cash target. So I guess, the question is how are you gauging the market for bolt-ons versus potentially if the oil price holds up here in terms of looking at more cash return this year?"

So we're very fortunate, we've got a lot of cash. And we've got a lot of, hopefully, we believe, a lot of cash coming. 
So that's a lot of great opportunities for us to consider additional special dividends, bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. And we keeping in mind -- as Tim talked about, we want to keep in mind, our debt reduction targets in a year.

Similarly, as we've done over the past few years, we're consistently focused on getting better year-after-year. And so by driving down well cost through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in the opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. 
In addition to that, we have 2 other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on, is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments, our exploration effort is really focused on, again, making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low-decline, high-impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. 
And again, regardless of any growth rate, when you're reinvesting in higher-return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base of the company year-after-year. And that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year."

And then the Powder River Basin is certainly in early maturing or early growth phase play. 
So each one of those, we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time and maximize returns.

It -- we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns. And what we've -- the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad, where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad. 
And really, this is a geologic province, a type of play where industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator. And we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques, where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns. The attractive thing about Australia again is not only does it fit into our experience level from operations and a technical perspective, but it has many offtake and oilfield service availability there.

With that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health of the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that. 
And specifically, when it comes to the special dividend, can you just clarify, is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion of minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for the 2023 maturity and then everything else kind of gets paid out in due time and it kind of needs to be meaningful?

And the way you talked about it, you said, for you, you would look at it in an opportunistic way, is the word I remember you said, in a downturn. 
And I guess my question is it's easy to see a downturn in retrospect, right? 6 months ago, you guys had a 3 handle on your stock. But it's hard to recognize when you're in it. So is there any guideposts that you can share about how you would recognize when you're in one of those downturns and it's time to be opportunistic?

It's been a little bouncy on the COVID recovery and oil demand. But we're seeing very steady improvements. I think we're up to maybe 95 million barrel a day demand right now, we think. Maybe by the end of the year, that will get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. The inventories are dropping. And we think there will be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. 
And then the spare capacity is going fine. It's been extended and drawn out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year. But we believe, again as demand picks up, that, that spare capacity will be put back online. We don't want to give you the data when everything is okay. We'll just have to watch and see it. But certainly, everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market, as oil prices have responded to that, I think it's what we're saying and seeing is not different than what the consensus view is. 
On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low and supply is less. And demand is higher this year than supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year with pretty low inventories. So depending -- obviously, it always depends on the weather on gas. And so we'll just have to see how all that turns out. But we're optimistic on gas also."

I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through to a 3-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies of being able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to a 2-mile lateral, those kind of things.

Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double premium investment standard. Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter. Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance while capital expenditures and total per unit operating costs were below expectations. 
We are delivering exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the company's unique ability to sustainably lower cost. Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. 
I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow. As double premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividend, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks and small high-return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities. In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by $750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of $1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. 
We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Delaware Basin over the last 12 months. Year-to-date, we have committed $2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion of free cash flow we've generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed. As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. 
We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns. Over the last 4 years, we've made huge progress reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We are focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions. 
This quarter, we announced a carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net-zero ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments. Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest cost highest return and lowest emission producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve."

While we announced our shift to the double premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of retu",532,"Thanks, Bill. 
While we announced our shift to the double premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. In the 3 years that followed, our premium drilling program drove a 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment nearly 40% lower compared to the 3-year period prior to premium. 
This comparative financial performance can be reviewed on Slide 15 of our investor presentation. In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step change in our financial performance, while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck is now positioning EOG for a similar step change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, capital efficiency and cash flow. 
Double premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs, resulting in well payouts of approximately 6 months at current strip prices. The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these high-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow. This year, we are averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company. 
And when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions is driving higher full-cycle returns. Looking back over the last 4 quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil. And it begins with disciplined reinvestment in high-return double premium drilling. While EOG is 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double premium wells located across each of our core assets. 
We are confident we can continue to grow our double premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last 5 years. In the past 12 months, through 8 deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2,500 per acre. 
These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which, in some cases, receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure. Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle. EOG's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory predominantly through organic exploration is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals. 
2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG. Our exceptional well level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation. Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance."
269660,1671602550,2364670,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra.

Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions. We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year. 
As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020. We continue to see operational improvements outpaced the inflationary pressure in the service sector. Average drilling days are down 11%, and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%. We are utilizing our recently discussed Super Zipper completions on about 1/3 of our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year. 
In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date. We have line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. Water reuse is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand reuse infrastructure throughout our development areas. Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-priced contracts for drilling rigs and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next. 
We also use the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas. As an example, last summer, we prepurchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when prices were at their lowest point. EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry. But this forward-looking approach helps EOG mitigate anticipated cost increases. 
As a reminder, 65% of our well costs are locked in for the year, and the remaining costs we are actively working down through operational efficiencies. As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity, with the goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022. But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year. 
The same amount of air freight is being placed on reducing our per unit operating cost, with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense and lower maintenance expenses. Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate. These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well. 
These and other continual improvements are a great testament to our pleased but not satisfied culture. This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year. We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity. Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future -- further improvements to our emissions performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane and our goal to eliminate routine flaring. 
Achieving these targets is the first step on the path towards our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse. For company-wide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reuse sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than 1/5 of the total water used. 
These achievements and other, along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October. We are starting to fill in the pieces on the road map to get to net-zero by 2040. Here's Ken with the details."

Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Our ambition is aggressive but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset. We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions. 
We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible. Our net-zero strategy generally falls into 3 categories: reduce, capture or offset. That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage and offsetting any remaining emissions. Reducing emissions intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint. 
Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results. We made excellent progress in the last 4 years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field invest in pilots using existing and new technologies and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies. As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80% and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%. 
We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop gas capture project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption. We designed an automated system that redirects natural gas back into our infrastructure system and injects the gas temporarily back into existing wells. The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further -- for future production and beneficial use. 
The result is a double premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. Our wellhead gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and rollout of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will help capture more of the remaining 0.4%. 
Turning to our efforts to capture CO2. We are launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage. This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions. We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capture and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, well in facility design and field operations. 
Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. We will provide updates on our pilot CCS project as it progresses. EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions. Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift.  
Compressors are the largest source of EOG's stationary combustion emissions. By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas, EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency. Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel. Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas. 
While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale. We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements or exploration success. This is a bottom-up-driven initiative. EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge. We create innovative solutions and apply technology to solve problems, improve processes and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns. 
The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net 0 ambition, and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible. Now here is Bill to wrap up."

In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. Results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double premium and the beginning of another step change in performance. Second, EOG is not satisfied. We are committed to getting better. sustainable cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level. At the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance. 
Third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed. As we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority.

EOG has obviously been an organic story for many, many years. And you've touched on exploration again today, but Yates was one of the, I guess, the step-out acquisitions that you did. And if we look at your portfolio position today, there's clearly a large asset potentially for sale right in your backyard in a very high-quality acreage position, you could argue. 
Why would M&A not be a feature of the business at some point? And maybe I go so far as to say, would you rule yourself out of being interested in that shale package."

We're focused on these small, high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And as discussed in the opening remarks, the larger expensive M&A deals, the opportunity struggle to compete with the existing return profile that we have within the company due to either high PDP cost, the high acreage costs or both. 
Oftentimes, acreage being marketed, it might be additive to the quantity of our inventory but not additive to the quality. And as we've discussed, as you know, we're always working to improve the quality of our assets. We're having a great success with the small bolt-on acquisitions. We're feeling very confident with our ability to increase the quality of our deep inventory through our organic exploration program. And so we're excited about our prospects there."

The first one, maybe that, Bill, you can help us to frame it to understand the decision a little bit better. If we look at the last quarter, when you announced the special dividend, I think you set a number of preconditions, and that's all being met, such as generate substantial free cash flow. 
You don't have much of the debt maturity in the near term and your cash is already in excess of what you think is a reasonable level, which is $2 billion. If we look in this quarter, basically, all those conditions are still being match, but you decided not to decay another special dividend. 
So we're just trying to understand that what is the additional consideration in that decision. And also, if you can talk about between buyback and special dividend at this point of the cycle, which is more preferable for you or how do you look at the differences? So that's the first question. 
The second question is related to I think that you guys hear this on the unquestioned leader in many of the basins. You are not interested in large scale M&A, which understandable. Does it make sense, however, that to work with some of your peers to pull together the asset to form a really large joint venture. So everyone still have their own equity ownership. You don't pay any premium, but you will be able to allow to use your technical know-how, to apply to even a larger scale asset and drive even better efficiency gains. Do you think that it makes sense for EOG for that higher structure?"

So on the first question, I think it's super important. And I think we've already shared this. Our -- we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out, on that framework and significantly given in that framework, significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders. And going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. So as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way. 
It's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. As the company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return. And in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks along with special dividends. And so we look at opportunistic buybacks as being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and countercyclic environments where the market is not well and our stock price is significantly undervalued. 
Well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks. In good times, we think the special dividend is the way to go, and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hopeful to continue to execute in the future. 
On the second part of your question on the large-scale M&A I'm going to ask Billy to kind of think through that question and give his feelings on that."

On the large-scale M&A, as we just talked about a minute ago, certainly, we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. And as we think about forming maybe a potential larger JV, that same approach needs to apply as we look across the fence. If our if our assets are in what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring fence would dilute our efforts. 
We've also taken, as you know, taken a lot of effort to build out the infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns. And we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage that may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that. 
So I think each operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can and forming JVs doesn't necessarily improve overall company metrics. So I think while we've looked at bolt-ons as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage. I think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about JV expansions, continuing to core up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that."

And on the supply side, as I said before, we believe that the U.S. will stay disciplined and there'll be a small growth in the U.S. next year but not much growth. And we see OPEC Plus, they look to be very solid. So they'll continue to bring back on their shut-in volumes and spare capacity as needed gradually. And we see that spare capacity if the recovery continues, like we expect, we see spare capacity could be very low by the second quarter or by the middle of next year. So we'll just have to watch and see how it goes. But overall, we see a very positive macro environment."

And so I think that is a function of resource maturity. I think when you get in down spacing in spacing and in timing and all that. I think it's going to subdue the productivity. And so literally, the biggest factor, of course, is in the capital discipline where you're spending tremendously amount of less cash flow than we've been spending in the previous year. So when you put all that together, we do not see -- and we think the discipline will remain with the group. We do not see the U.S. growing significantly next year.

Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double-premium investment standard. Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter. Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per unit operating costs were below expectations.
We are delivering exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the company's unique ability to sustainably lower cost. Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.
I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow. As double premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividend, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks and small high-return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities. In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by $750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of $1.5 billion in regular and special dividends.
We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Delaware Basin over the last 12 months. Year-to-date, we have committed $2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion of free cash flow we've generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed. As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way.
We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns. Over the last 4 years, we've made huge progress reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We are focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.
This quarter, we announced a carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net-zero ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments. Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emission producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve."

While we announced our shift to the double-premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return",528,"Thanks, Bill. While we announced our shift to the double-premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. In the 3 years that followed, our premium drilling program drove a 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment nearly 40% lower compared to the 3-year period prior to premium.
This comparative financial performance can be reviewed on Slide 15 of our investor presentation. In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step change in our financial performance, while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck is now positioning EOG for a similar step change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, capital efficiency and cash flow.
Double premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs, resulting in well payouts of approximately 6 months at current strip prices. The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these high-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow. This year, we are averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company.
And when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions is driving higher full-cycle returns. Looking back over the last 4 quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil. And it begins with disciplined reinvestment in high-return double-premium drilling. While EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double-premium wells located across each of our core assets.
We are confident we can continue to grow our double-premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last 5 years. In the past 12 months, through 8 deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2,500 per acre.
These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which, in some cases, receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure. Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle. EOG's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory predominantly through organic exploration is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals.
2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG. Our exceptional well level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation. Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance."
269660,1671602550,2365048,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra.

Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions. We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year.
As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020. We continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector. Average drilling days are down 11%, and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%. We are utilizing our recently discussed Super-Zipper completions on about 1/3 of our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year.
In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date. We have line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. Water reuse is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand reuse infrastructure throughout our development areas. Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-priced contracts for drilling rigs and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next.
We also use the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas. As an example, last summer, we prepurchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when prices were at their lowest point. EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry. But this forward-looking approach helps EOG mitigate anticipated cost increases.
As a reminder, 65% of our well costs are locked in for the year, and the remaining costs we are actively working down through operational efficiencies. As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity, with the goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022. But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year.
The same amount of air freight is being placed on reducing our per unit operating cost, with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense and lower maintenance expenses. Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate. These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well.
These and other continual improvements are a great testament to our pleased but not satisfied culture. This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year. We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity. Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future -- further improvements to our emissions performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane and our goal to eliminate routine flaring.
Achieving these targets is the first step on the path towards our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse. For company-wide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reuse sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than 1/5 of the total water used.
These achievements and other, along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October. We are starting to fill in the pieces on the road map to get to net-zero by 2040. Here's Ken with the details."

Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040.

Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Our ambition is aggressive but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset. We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions.
We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible. Our net-zero strategy generally falls into 3 categories: reduce, capture or offset. That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage and offsetting any remaining emissions. Reducing emissions intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint.
Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results. We made excellent progress in the last 4 years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies. As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80% and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%.
We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop gas capture project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption. We designed an automated system that redirects natural gas back into our infrastructure system and injects the gas temporarily back into existing wells. The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further -- for future production and beneficial use.
The result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. Our wellhead gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and roll-out of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will help capture more of the remaining 0.4%.
Turning to our efforts to capture CO2. We are launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage. This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions. We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capture and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, well and facility design and field operations.
Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. We will provide updates on our pilot CCS project as it progresses. EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions. Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift.
Compressors are the largest source of EOG's stationary combustion emissions. By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas, EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency. Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel. Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas.
While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale. We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements or exploration success. This is a bottom-up-driven initiative. EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge. We create innovative solutions and apply technology to solve problems, improve processes and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns.
The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net zero ambition, and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible. Now here is Bill to wrap up."

So it's not really attributable from -- to one basin or the other, it's just a function of the impact of shifting to double premium across our portfolio. And I might add as we look to add wells to the inventory of double-premium wells, they'll be in that same category to compete on both returns and finding costs."

This year, we've been very successful executing on all of our cash flow priorities in the framework that we've kind of laid out. We've been able to increase the regular dividend by 10%, which we feel is our primary mode of capital return.
Secondly, we were able to reduce our debt earlier this year by $750 million by retiring a bond. And then third, we just paid a $600 million special dividend on July 30 of this year, which we had announced during the last earnings call. So our year-to-date free cash flow commitment is $2.3 billion, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion we generated.
And going forward, our framework and priorities have not changed. Lastly, we also highlighted in the opening remarks, as we just spoke about a little bit with Leo, some of the small bolt-on acquisitions we've done, which is one of the avenues to growing our inventory.
And that's really the -- where the entire process begins, is having the depth and quality of inventory to continually improve the business. And with our shift to drilling these double-premium wells, the free cash flow potential of the company continues to expand. And as it does and as we realize the cash, we're well positioned to continue executing on our priorities. We're committed to creating the most shareholder value and our cash return strategy is really a reflection of that. So as the company continues to improve, we're excited about that potential."

We're still leasing across many of the plays as well. And as we've discussed, the opportunities are really targeting a higher quality rock than what's typically been drilled horizontally.

The first one, maybe that, Bill, you can help us to frame it to understand the decision a little bit better. If we look at the last quarter, when you announced the special dividend, I think you set a number of preconditions, and that's all being met, such as you generate substantial free cash flow.
You don't have much of the debt maturity in the near term and your cash is already in excess of what you think is a reasonable level, which is $2 billion. If we look in this quarter, basically, all those conditions are still being match, but you decided not to declare another special dividend.
So we're just trying to understand that what is the additional consideration in that decision. And also, if you can talk about between buyback and special dividend at this point of the cycle, which is more preferable for you or how do you look at the differences? So that's the first question.
The second question is related to I think that you guys clearly is one of the unquestioned leaders in many of the basins. You are not interested in large scale M&A, which understandable. Does it make sense, however, that to work with some of your peers to pull together the asset to form a really large joint venture? So everyone still have their own equity ownership. You don't pay any premium, but you will be able to allow to use your technical know-how to apply to even a larger scale asset and drive even better efficiency gains.

Our -- we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out, on that framework and significantly given -- in that framework, significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders. And going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. So as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way.
It's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. As the company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return. And in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks as long as -- along with special dividends. And so we look at opportunistic buybacks as being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and countercyclic environments where the market is not well and our stock price is significantly undervalued. Well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks.
In good times, we think the special dividend is the way to go, and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hopeful to continue to execute in the future.

On the large-scale M&A, as Ezra just talked about a minute ago, certainly, we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. And as we think about forming maybe a potential larger JV, that same approach needs to apply as we look across the fence. If our -- if our assets are in what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring fence would dilute our efforts.
We've also taken -- as you know, taken a lot of effort to build out the infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns. And we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage that may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that.
So I think each operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can and forming JVs doesn't necessarily improve overall company metrics. So I think while we've looked at bolt-ons as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage, I think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about JV expansions, continuing to core up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that."

Undoubtedly, it's likely that the cost for tubulars will be higher next year than they are this year, which is why in that Slide #10 we tried to give you some color on other ways we're trying to keep our well cost flat to down going into next year. And those come from the efficiencies we're seeing across the operation from drilling time to the implementation of our Super-Zipper technology on the completion side to newer contracts at a lower rate for some of the services we have. So it's a mixture of things we use to offset those inflationary pressures we see in the different parts of our business."

But the advantages, of course, has been able to double the amount of stages you get in a particular day by attacking the locations 2 at a time.

Last year, we probably did less than 10% of our wells across the company benefited from Super-Zipper.

And overall, in the other groups, not specific to EOG, but we generally see well productive -- well production to be flat, to not improving over time.
And so I think that is a function of resource maturity. I think when you get in down spacing and spacing and in timing and all that, I think it's going to subdue the productivity. And so literally, the biggest factor, of course, is in the capital discipline where you're spending tremendously amount of less cash flow than we've been spending in the previous year. So when you put all that together, we do not see -- we think the discipline will remain with the group. We do not see the U.S. growing significantly next year.

EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend and an update to our share buyba",848,"Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high-return investment. 
During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings and cash flow records. Adjusted net income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings and cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria. Our premium hurdle rate was established not only to protect the company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. 
The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We have generated free cash flow every year since. 
From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3x. While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. 
Our employees, empowered by EOG's unique culture applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016 and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium. 
Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the company not only for 2020 but for our stellar results this year. 
There is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. 
Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor to spend the dividend, suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. 
Going forward, we are confident that double-premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did 5 years ago. We are also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double-premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new plays from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, developing high-return, low-cost reserves that meet our stringent double premium hurdle rate, expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. 
EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture. EOG's competitive advantage is our people and today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. 
Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals as we plan for next year. We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. 
Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earnings release in 3 points. First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high-return projects consistently executed year after year is delivering outstanding financial results. 
Second, we are still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions and organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well positioned to execute our high-return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities."
269660,1682438223,2427598,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities.

As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities. First is high-return, disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. However, market fundamentals remain the #1 determinant of when to grow. 
Second is the regular dividend which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We have paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably fund both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. 
This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine balance sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong balance sheet. It's not conservatism. It's a competitive advantage. Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday, we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buyback authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. 
We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buyback in a cyclical industry. We know and expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself. 
We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we are not in the market for expensive M&A. It is simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash. Our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. 
With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion and will have returned more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. This is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium. Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. 
In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend to special dividends and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increase or decrease the cash balance. But over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders. Here's Billy."

As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. 
Well productivity driven by our double premium hurdle rate continues to outperform, while our drilling and completion teams pushed the envelope on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and redesigning drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations and reducing sand and water sourcing cost. 
Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to a common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multi-play company with activity spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between plays to optimize returns. 
Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams closer to the operation rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our frontline employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvements. 
Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers. We are typically -- we are not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns. But we also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during the inflationary periods. 
Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise and proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products and much more. As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. 
And finally, we apply world-class information technology to every part of our operation. Our data gathering and analysis capabilities continue to improve which we leverage to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year. 
This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. And as we move into next year, we are on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90-plus percent of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. 
While it's still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus, we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. Now here's Ken."

As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 routine flaring across all our operations by 2025 with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. 
We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles the technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed-loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring. 
We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we are piloting technology in the field such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts at EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. 
We have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over the last several years speaks for itself, and we are committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. Now here's Ezra to wrap things up."

Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year and the cash return announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different gear culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year, our fundamental strategy executed year after year by employees united by a unique culture, dates back to the founding of the company. That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead. 
We are a return-focused organic exploration company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better. decentralized, nonbureaucratic. Every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We are committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward, investors can expect more of the same, consistent execution year after year. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A."

And in theory that if you're going to budget when the market is suffering the downturn. Does that mean that you should have a really strong balance sheet going into the downturn? Maybe at a net cash position in order for you to be able to afford it. Like last year that in the -- at the [indiscernible] of the pandemic, your share price was really attractive, but I'm not sure that you have the balance sheet or that will to do the buyback at that point? So that's the first question. 
The second question is on the hedging. You have been quite aggressive putting in a lot of natural gas hedges. Two is that, I mean, with your low breakeven requirement and a very strong balance sheet, why put on the hedges so aggressively -- And to some degree, even though you have the physical barrel or MCF to support it.

Specifically, to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic, but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that. You're exactly right. At that point in time, oil was negative. The price of oil was negative. We had 2 bonds coming due totaling $1 billion. So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would have been a perfect time to buy shares, but we weren't in that same position we are today.

And the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance as we've witnessed with that change to premium. 
And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins, we have 5,800 of these double premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day. Our employees are working through either identifying low-cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well cost reductions. As we've highlighted this quarter, stronger well productivity. And then, of course, our low-cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory.

And then, of course, we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix. We're drilling wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed plays.

The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which for us, we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now, but that brings up kind of that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. 
And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at the scheduled rate that should translate into rising inventory levels. And if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe our pre-COVID levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrels a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. 
But again, that's as we're sitting here today. We'll be officially firming up that 2022 plan and watching how the market develops over the next couple of months. But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags. So we're watching to see if is that more routine startup challenges? Or is that more structural in nature due to underinvestment. And those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seeing how the continued demand recovery from COVID really develops with any potential future lockdowns, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward."

I think it's a surprise to everybody. And then the inventory numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online. And the spare capacity, again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online, that would contemplate some time in the front half of the year. But as I highlighted and everyone's been seeing, there are some challenges or hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online.

In fact, we are reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that.

And we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend, to strengthen the balance sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions. And then more on point with your question, the other cash return options, which are special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that, not only this year, with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over year-to-date, free cash flow generation of about $3.5 billion. 
But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer term, what we've been able to do in providing just over 5 -- just over $5 billion of free cash flow return since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework. I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials really demonstrates our commitment to it. And as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number, I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. 
To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so walking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change. is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that."

And the follow-up is I appreciate the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs and how you guys are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and mitigating some of these inflationary pressures. As you step back and think about the U.S. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be a challenge?

Certainly, as an industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of inflationary pressure, mainly in 3 areas, I would say, steel prices. So tubulars; labor, which is certainly affects all industries; and then fuel, those are probably the 3 inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be -- or maybe 2 things, 2 top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then the other 1 would be labor and is getting enough people to manage the activity levels. 
Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year, we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity, but in this case, also protect us from inflation. So for instance, in 2021, we protected about 65% of our well cost going into the year. And as a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we were able to reduce our average well cost by about 7% as Ezra stated earlier. 
So during the year, though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and lock them through -- in through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well costs secured. And with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. So we expect to see inflation certainly in items such as steel, labor and fuel, just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation.

EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities.

Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high-return investment. 
During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings and cash flow records. Adjusted net income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings and cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria. Our premium hurdle rate was established not only to protect the company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. 
The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We have generated free cash flow every year since. 
From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3x. While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. 
Our employees, empowered by EOG's unique culture applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016 and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium. 
Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the company not only for 2020 but for our stellar results this year. 
There is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. 
Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor to spend the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. 
Going forward, we are confident that double-premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did 5 years ago. We are also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double-premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new plays from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, developing high-return, low-cost reserves that meet our stringent double premium hurdle rate, expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. 
EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture, EOG's competitive advantage is our people and today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. 
Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals, as we plan for next year. We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. 
Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earnings release in 3 points: First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high-return projects consistently executed year after year is delivering outstanding financial results. 
Second, we are still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions and organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well positioned to execute our high-return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities."
269660,1682438223,2428125,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities.

As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities. First is high-return, disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. However, market fundamentals remain the #1 determinant of when to grow. 
Second is the regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We have paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably fund both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. 
This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine balance sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong balance sheet. It's not conservatism. It's a competitive advantage. Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday, we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buyback authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. 
We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buyback in a cyclical industry. We know and expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself. 
We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we are not in the market for expensive M&A. It is simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash. Our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. 
With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion and will have returned more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. This is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium. Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. 
In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend to special dividends and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increase or decrease the cash balance, but over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders. Here's Billy."

As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. 
Well productivity driven by our double premium hurdle rate continues to outperform, while our drilling and completion teams pushed the envelope on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and redesigning drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations and reducing sand and water sourcing cost. 
Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to a common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multi-play company with activity spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between plays to optimize returns. 
Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams closer to the operation rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our frontline employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvements. 
Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers. We are typically -- we are not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns, but we also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during the inflationary periods. 
Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise and proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products and much more. As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. 
And finally, we apply world-class information technology to every part of our operation. Our data gathering and analysis capabilities continue to improve, which we leverage to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year. 
This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. And as we move into next year, we are on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90-plus percent of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. 
While it's still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus, we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. Now here's Ken."

As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 routine flaring across all our operations by 2025 with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. 
We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 1/10 of 1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles the technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed-loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring. 
We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we are piloting technology in the field such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts at EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day.

Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year and the cash return announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different gear culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year, our fundamental strategy executed year after year by employees united by unique culture, dates back to the founding of the company. That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead. 
We are a return-focused organic exploration company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better, decentralized, non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We are committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders.

But quite frankly, I don't recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the conditional criteria for you to actually act on it?

First of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision, how does it create long-term shareholder value. So that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every time we make this decision. Specifically, to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic, but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that. You're exactly right. At that point in time, oil was negative. The price of oil was negative. We had 2 bonds coming due totaling $1 billion. 
So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would have been a perfect time to buy shares, but we weren't in that same position we are today. That's how -- that's why continuing to work on the balance sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to EOG. So we should not ever have that situation again. We have positioned the company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of these situations."

And so when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of $3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price. In general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on; whether oil or gas, it just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process as we enter into a new year.

We've been seeing it slowly but surely show up in our financial performance, as we've lowered the cost basis of the company. And the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance, as we've witnessed with that change to premium. 
And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. We have 5,800 of these double premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day. Our employees are working through either identifying low-cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well cost reductions. As we've highlighted this quarter, stronger well productivity. And then, of course, our low-cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory.

So when I think about that, I think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into double-premium status. 
And then, of course, we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix. We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed plays. Those plays are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data or kind of evaluating, as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability, production performance of those plays. 
And so we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand. And as I said, increase the quality of our double premium inventory.

But in general, our focus on 2022 the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, there are the 3 items that you referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. At first, is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels. The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which for us, we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now, but that brings up kind of that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. 
And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at the scheduled rate that should translate into rising inventory levels. And if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe our pre-COVID levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrels a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. 
But again, that's as we're sitting here today, we'll be officially firming up that 2022 plan and watching how the market develops over the next couple of months. But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags. So we're watching to see if is that more routine startup challenges or is that more structural in nature due to underinvestment. And those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seeing how the continued demand recovery from COVID really develops with any potential future lockdowns, so on and so forth.

The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return. Through 2017 to 2019, during a period of rapid growth for the industry. In fact, we are reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. 
So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that. We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth."

And we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend, to strengthen the balance sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions. And then more on point with your question, the other cash return options, which are special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that, not only this year, with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over year-to-date free cash flow generation of about $3.5 billion. 
But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer term what we've been able to do in providing just over 5 -- just over $5 billion of free cash flow return since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework. I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials really demonstrates our commitment to it. And as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number, I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. 
To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think. We will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that."

Certainly, as an industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of inflationary pressure, mainly in 3 areas, I would say, steel prices, so tubulars; labor, which is certainly affects all industries and then fuel. Those are probably the 3 inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be -- or maybe 2 things -- 2 top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then the other one would be labor and is getting enough people to manage the activity levels. 
Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year, we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity, but in this case, also protect us from inflation. So for instance, in 2021, we protected about 65% of our well cost going into the year. And as a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we were able to reduce our average well cost by about 7% as Ezra stated earlier. 
So during the year, though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and lock them through -- in through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well costs secured. And with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. So we expect to see inflation certainly in items such as steel, labor and fuel, just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident we can keep well cost at least flat going into next year."

EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities.

Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high-return investment. 
During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings and cash flow records, adjusted net income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings and cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria. Our premium hurdle rate was established not only to protect the company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. 
The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well, continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We have generated free cash flow every year since. 
From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3x. While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. 
Our employees, empowered by EOG's unique culture, applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016 and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium. 
Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil, was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepare the company not only for 2020 but for our stellar results this year. There is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. 
Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor disband the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. 
Going forward, we are confident that double premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did 5 years ago. We are also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new plays from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, developing high-return, low-cost reserves that meet our stringent double premium hurdle rate, expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. 
EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture. EOG's competitive advantage is our people and today's announcements are a reflection of our culture, of innovation and execution. Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals, as we plan for next year. 
We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earning release in 3 points: First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high-return projects consistently executed year after year is delivering outstanding financial results. Second, we are still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions and organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well positioned to execute our high-return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. 
Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities."
269660,1682438223,2457748,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities.

As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities. First is high-return, disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. However, market fundamentals remain the #1 determinant of when to grow. Second is the regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We have paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably fund both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. 
This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine balance sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong balance sheet. It's not conservatism. It's a competitive advantage. Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday, we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buyback authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. 
We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buyback in a cyclical industry. We know and expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself. 
We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we are not in the market for expensive M&A. It is simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. 
With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion, increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion and will have returned more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. This is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium. Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. 
In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend, two special dividends and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increase or decrease the cash balance, but over time the cash will go back to our shareholders. 
Here's Billy."

As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. 
Well productivity, driven by our double premium hurdle rate, continues to outperform, while our drilling and completion teams pushed the envelope on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and redesigning drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations and reducing sand and water sourcing cost. 
Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to a common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multi-play company with activity spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between plays to optimize returns. Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams closer to the operation rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our frontline employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvements. 
Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers. We are typically -- we are not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns, but we also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during the inflationary periods. Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise and proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products and much more. 
As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. And finally, we apply world-class information technology to every part of our operation. Our data gathering and analysis capabilities continue to improve, which we leverage to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year. 
This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. And as we move into next year, we're on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90-plus percent of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. While it's still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus, we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. 
Now here's Ken."

As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 routine flaring across all our operations by 2025 with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. 
We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 0.1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles the technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed-loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring. 
We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we are piloting technology in the field such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts at EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. We have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over the last several years speaks for itself. And we are committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance.

Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year and the cash return announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different gear culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year our fundamental strategy executed year after year by employees united by unique culture dates back to the founding of the company. 
That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead. We are a return-focused organic exploration company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better, decentralized, non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a businessperson first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We are committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward investors can expect more of the same, consistent execution year after year.

But quite frankly, I don't recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the conditional criteria for you to actually act on it? And in theory that if you're going to buy it when the market is suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong balance sheet going into the downturn maybe at a net cash position in order for you to be able to afford it? Like last year that in the -- at the top of the pandemic, your share price was really attractive, but I'm not sure that you had the balance sheet or that will to do the buyback at that point. So that's the first question. 
The second question is on the hedging. You have been quite aggressive putting in a lot of natural gas hedges. Two is that, I mean, with your low breakeven requirement and a very strong balance sheet, why put on the hedges so aggressively?

At that point in time, oil was negative. The price of oil was negative. We had 2 bonds coming due totaling $1 billion. 
So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would have been a perfect time to buy shares, but we weren't in that same position we are today.

Our employees are working through either identifying low-cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well cost reductions. As we've highlighted this quarter, stronger well productivity. And then, of course, our low-cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory. So I think as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of EOG and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend."

So when I think about that, I think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into double premium status. 
And then, of course, we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix. We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed plays. Those plays are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data or kind of evaluating, as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability, production performance of those plays. And so we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand and, as I said, increase the quality of our double premium inventory. And ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue to lower the cost base of the company, increase the capital efficiency of EOG and continue to support a sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment."

As Billy said, typically, we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call. But in general, our focus on 2022 the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, there are the 3 items that you referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. At first is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels. The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which, for us, we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now, but that brings up kind of that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. 
And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at the scheduled rate that should translate into rising inventory levels. And if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe our pre-COVID levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrel a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. 
But again, that's as we're sitting here today. We'll be officially firming up that 2022 plan and watching how the market develops over the next couple of months. But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags. So we're watching to see if is that more routine startup challenges or is that more structural in nature due to underinvestment. And those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seeing how the continued demand recovery from COVID really develops with any potential future lockdowns, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward."

Through 2017 to 2019, during a period of rapid growth for the industry, in fact, we are reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. 
So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year.

It seems to be a persistent barrier perhaps to recognition of sustainable free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value. I'm just wondering why there's a reluctance not to commit to or at least lay out some kind of framework as to how you think about the go-forward cash returns as opposed to one-off special dividends."

And we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend, to strengthen the balance sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions. And then more on point with your question, the other cash return options, which are special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that, not only this year, with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over year-to-date free cash flow generation of about $3.5 billion. 
But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer term what we've been able to do in providing just over 5 -- just over $5 billion of free cash flow return since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework. I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials really demonstrates our commitment to it. And as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number, I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. 
To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think. We'll create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that."

Certainly, as an industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of inflationary pressure, mainly in 3 areas, I would say, steel prices, so tubulars; labor, which is -- certainly affects all industries and then fuel. Those are probably the 3 inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be -- or maybe 2 things -- 2 top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then the other one would be labor and is getting enough people to manage the activity levels. 
Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year, we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity, but in this case, also protect us from inflation. So for instance, in 2021, we protected about 65% of our well cost going into the year. And as a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we were able to reduce our average well cost by about 7% as Ezra stated earlier. 
So during the year, though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and lock them through -- in through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well costs secured. And with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. So we expect to see inflation certainly in items such as steel, labor and fuel, just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident we can keep well cost at least flat going into next year."
