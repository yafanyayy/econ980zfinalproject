At Abiomed, we continue to remain both focused and committed to our mission of recovering hearts and saving lives despite the challenging cobot environment. I want to thank our employees and our customers around",1870,"Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. At Abiomed, we continue to remain both focused and committed to our mission of recovering hearts and saving lives despite the challenging cobot environment. 
I want to thank our employees and our customers around the world and recognize their determination and efforts under these circumstances. Abiomed delivered a record quarter of $232 million in revenue up 5% year-over-year. We generated revenue growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe and Japan, despite the COVID resurgence. 
Operationally, we were disciplined and focused on executing our fiscal year tactical plan with multiple regulatory milestones and 21st in human clinical studies. We achieved a 31% operating margin while investing at record levels of $33 million in research and development, our balance sheet strengthened to a robust $788 million in cash while maintaining 0 debt. 
We also achieved a significant milestone this quarter as we surpassed over 1,000 Impella patents and currently have 851 patents pending. We believe Abiomed has one of the strongest IP portfolios in the medical device industry. In summary, we executed our plan and had a solid quarter. 
For today's call, I'm going to provide 3 updates. First, I will outline our transition to the green phase in Q4 by leveraging our Abiomed 2.0 COVID Playbook. 
Second, I will highlight the robust clinical data released in October. And finally, I will discuss our momentum with new products and regulatory approvals. So first, as a reminder to investors, we designated a 3 Phase red, yellow, green approach for FY '21 to address the evolving COVID-19 environment. 
In the Q3 yellow phase, we were focused on the acceleration of Abiomed 2.0 as we endured the pandemic. This enabled us to achieve our tactical plan, and reduce the COVID impact on our commercial performance. 
These initiatives were accomplished without sacrificing our commitment to employee health or safety. We ramped up our on-site antigen and PCR testing in both Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany for early virus detection and administered thousands of COVID tests. 
This proactive testing reduced employee anxiety and allowed us to get production back to full capacity to build essential life-saving heart pumps during a record quarter in our 40-year history as a company. Because we provide essential patient support and training to our hospitals, more than 25% of our U.S. field team has received the COVID-19 vaccine from their local customers. 
We look forward to that number growing as the vaccine becomes more available in the months ahead for headquarters employees. 
In Q3, we executed on the milestones we control and grew revenue across all geographies. 
As a whole, hospitals today are managing better than they have previously during the pandemic with more testing, better protocols and vaccinated caregivers. This allows for better patient management and treatment of both COVID and non-COVID patients. However, the virus resurgence in mid-November impacted utilization, especially in the U.S. due to ICU capacity and patient anxiety about seeking in-hospital treatment. 
At this point, we believe our Abiomed 2.0 COVID Playbook will allow for a green phase transition in Q4 despite their early January ramp-up in COVID cases. This playbook allows for patient monitoring in the cloud and makes our people more productive and valuable for the hospital. 
Our Impella Connect online capability is now live at 686 hospitals in the U.S., and there are an additional 500 ready to connect once hospitals approved WiFi access. 
Today, more than half of our U.S. patients are monitored in the cloud with Impella Connect. This enables best-in-class 24/7 support on-site, on-call and online. 
As part of our Abiomed 2.0 Playbook, we monitor global and local trends at a state, city and hospital level on Impella usage, new COVID cases and ICU capacity. 
This enables our flexibility with our people and resources to adapt quickly to essential patients. We have been working with physician societies as well as hospitals to reinforce the importance and benefits of treating essential high-risk in cardiogenic shock patients. 
Also, we are investing in educating the public with both online and broadcast TV commercials to encourage patients to seek treatment for their heart disease. 
Turning to my second topic, new clinical data. In October at TCT Connect, we received and reviewed a robust set of clinical data showing improvement in outcomes. For high-risk Impella supported PCI, data from PROTECT III and Restore EF demonstrated statistically improved outcomes including better safety and improved heart function post treatment. 
The improvement in hard function with more complete revascularization is now objectively proven in high-risk PCI with Impella support. The PROTECT IV physician Executive Committee has locked the study protocol, and we have already initiated site visits with first patient enrolled targeted for next quarter, Q1. 
We are grateful to these physician experts for the last year of study design work and affirmation of protected PCI best practices. 
For cardiogenic shock, we continue to see improvements in survival, validated using best practice protocols, such as placing the Impella before the PCI and minimizing inotropes. 
These best practices have been generated over the last 5 years and were derived from multiple prospective physician studies and real-world evidence, including FDA studies. These 2020 updated cardiogenic shock best practices now include early identification of right heart failure with Smartassist software and escalation to by Pella support with Impella RP. 
Within the quarter, Impella RP revenue grew 21% versus prior year due to strength in patient utilization and expanded FDA emergency youth authorization for COVID complications, including pulmonary embolism. 
Recent studies in both Italy and Japan have also contributed to the validation of our cardiogenic shock protocols. 
As a countrywide initiative, Japan now has one of the highest survival rates for cardiogenic shock in the world, 77% survival and over 90% native heart recovery in survivors. 
To note, just 4 years ago, the CULPRIT study from top European heart hospitals, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported a 50% survival for cardiogenic shock patients using all devices as salvage post-PCI. These higher survival rates contributed to Japan's sales performance, up 38% in revenue year-over-year despite COVID. 
Moving to regulatory approvals and new products, our third and final topic, we made significant progress with 2 510(k) clearances and 2 first [indiscernible] MAN studies completed within the quarter. We received 510(k) clearance for ECMO Breathe OXY 1 system and treated our first 8 patients with a mix of BV, VA and Ecpella cases in the United States. 
The feedback has been positive, highlighting the ease of use, portability of the console and early mobilization. Additionally, we achieved 2 important milestones toward breaking the small bore barrier to reduce physician access and closure concerns. 
First, we completed the first 5 patients from our U.S. FDA early feasibility study for the Impella ECP, a true 9 French pump ideal for high-risk protected PCI. 
This safety data was submitted to the FDA and approved as sufficient data to support the expansion of the Impella ECP trial to 5 more hospitals and 15 more patients. 
Second, we received 510(k) clearance for the Impella XR sheet with the Impella 2.5 heart pump. We treated 8 patients with the XR sheet outside of the U.S. in Q3 and and have now transitioned the majority of our focus to the Impella CP for both 510(k) clearance and PMA supplements. 
The XR sheet has flexible night knoll brads that momentarily expand during Impella delivery than recoil, reducing closure, challenges and complications at the access site. 
These milestones are important steps to drive ease of use, expand our customer base and continue to drive better patient outcomes. 
However, it is important to note that bleeding and vascular complications in PROTECT III, our FDA study, were less than 2% for both showing the technical and clinical progress made over time with training, education and innovation. 
Our surgical platform continues to deliver strong performance, driven by the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist. Our Impella 5.5 is a minimally-invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant directly with the chest open, or through the axillary artery to avoid an invasive sternotomy. 
We created a dedicated surgical and heart failure team focused on heart recovery for acutely decompensating heart failure patients in shock. This week at the surgical STS conference Dr. Ed Solte from Cleveland Clinic presented data from a large study of 356 Impella 5.5 patients at 16 hospitals in the U.S. and Germany. 
The study found a 79% survival rate with the majority of surviving patients recovering their native heart. 
In Q3, our U.S. Surgical business grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. We have now treated more than 1,000 patients with the Impella 5.5 and demonstrated an improvement in patient outcomes compared to historical rates. 
While the Impella 5.5 has exceeded a run time of more than 500 days in our engineering labs, the Impella BTR pump is designed to run for more than 1 year and allow for home discharge with patient metrics in the cloud. The Impella BTR pump is now 1 year away from our anticipated first-in-human study. 
Both 5.5 and BTR have ideal designs because they are minimally invasive via the axillary artery and pump with the heart providing optimal weaning capability and improved forward flow to the kidneys. 
I would like to end with a patient story from the summer. In August, Chavez Adams, a 29-year old lawyer from North Carolina, tested positive for COVID-19 and quarantine for 2 weeks. 
In September, Chavaz has developed a fever and went to his local urgent clinical care, where they found his heart was racing above normal, and he passed out. Chavez was immediately admitted to wake Med health with an injection fraction less than 20% and went into cardiogenic shock. 
Dr. Nupani, and his team determined Chavez was experiencing cardiogenic shock for Myer [indiscernible], likely due to COVID 19. 
The Impella CP was implanted to allow his heart to rest. After 3 days of support, the Impella was weaned and ex-planted and care was covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield. 
Chavez has returned home with his native heart and now has a normal heart function. Today, he is back at work and enjoying an active lifestyle with his wife, Ashley. 
In conclusion, Abiomed with our dedicated customers continues to improve patient outcomes, documented in global clinical studies, which are posted on our website, as we advance our product portfolio and best practices. 
As we enter the final quarter of FY '21, we remain focused on achieving our tactical plan and transitioning to the green phase. 
Abiomed is a stronger company today than before the COVID pandemic and is uniquely focused on recovering hearts and saving lives for growing high-risk populations. We are excited to close Q4 as Abiomed 2.0 and enter FY '22 with our best ever clinical outcomes from existing products, existing indications and existing countries. 
Next fiscal year, Abiomed will expand into new products, new studies, new indications and new countries. I am sincerely proud of our employees and grateful to our customers who put patients first every day. 
We also appreciate the continued support of our investors and remain focused on growing shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

As Mike mentioned, in Q3, we delivered a record revenue quarter for the company of $232 million, an increase of 5% versus prior year.

As Mike mentioned, in Q3, we delivered a record revenue quarter for the company of $232 million, an increase of 5% versus prior year. While our business continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 trends, we were able to deliver positive year-over-year revenue growth in our top 3 markets by sticking with the priorities in our COVID playbook, remaining focused in leveraging our strengths for operating in this uncertain environment. 
By region, the U.S. reported revenue of $189 million, up 2% versus prior year primarily due to positive sales mix. U.S. patient utilization was down 2% year-over-year. 
However, we had tough comps last year in October, especially for cardiogenic shock. As Mike mentioned, the COVID-19 resurgence impacted continued recovery in patient utilization during the quarter. 
We started to see a broad-based impact from the resurgence beginning in mid-November. Our ability to track Cobot cases and ITU capacity at local levels enabled us to see trends between higher new cases and ICU capacity and the impact utilization and recovery. During the quarter, we were able to adapt and saw some areas begin to recover. 
At the end of December, in the U.S., the CP is now in 1,492 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 660 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 158 sites, up 37 sites versus prior quarter. 
We believe that all 1,100 heart hospitals will acquire this breakthrough technology. Our controlled rollout of the Impella 5.5 continues to deliver strong performance as our U.S. Surgical portfolio reported a 48% increase in revenue versus prior year. 
The Impella RP is now in 569 sites, up 17 sites versus Q2. RP had a strong quarter with revenue increasing 21% versus prior year, driven by patient utilization. As a reminder, in July, the FDA issued an EUA to expand the use of Impella RP to include patients suffering from COVID-19 related right ventricular complications, which is a great validation for this LI saving device. In the quarter, the reorder rate was 104%, the same percentage as the prior year. 
Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.7 units per site as compared to 4.6 in the prior quarter. 
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $43 million, up 18% year-over-year. Our European revenue increased 12% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization in several key markets, including Germany, Switzerland and Italy and a benefit from the Euro-U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. 
Within the quarter, both high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock grew mid-single digits. In Europe, we started to see an impact from the COVID resurgence early in the quarter. When certain countries began issuing national lockdowns. However, we were able to pivot our strategy and began to see some recovery in patient utilization in mid-November through December. 
The COVID pandemic continues to remain uncertain with differences by country on the timing of the recovery. In Japan, we had another strong quarter and delivered $12 million in revenue, up 38% over prior year, driven by higher patient utilization. We opened 14 new sites during the quarter. Bringing our total to 156 sites out of the potential 350 Impella hospitals. We did see an impact in November as COVID cases began to rise however, we saw some recovery in December. 
Japan's performance has remained more resilient than other countries during the pandemic because our patients are mostly in cardiogenic shock. Japan also has been able to leverage their best practice protocols in the COVID environment in order to treat shock patients, recover their native hearts and deliver record survival rates. Moving to key financial metrics. 
Our gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by higher production volumes, which more than offset the investment to accelerate the rollout of Impella Connect. 
One of our main objectives in our red yellow green approach to navigating the COVID environment is to continue innovating and investing as we execute our strategy and our tactical plan. 
During the third quarter, R&D expense increased 29% versus prior year to $33 million. We believe our targeted investments in technology and clinical data are critical for improving patient outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the third quarter totaled $86 million, up 1% versus prior year. We are managing our discretionary costs while continuing to invest in marketing, and training programs, including camp PCI and targeted advertising and to provide a safe environment for our employees. 
In the quarter, our costs included over $0.5 million for COVID testing and PPE for our people. This spend is being offset from lower expenses such as T&E and trade shows, among other postponed activities in the current environment. 
In the quarter, operating income grew 2% to $71 million, translating to an operating margin of 30.8%. And we delivered strong margins while making the necessary investments to support future growth. GAAP net income for the quarter was $62 million or $1.35 per diluted share versus $69 million or $1.51 in Q3 of '20. 
The year-over-year variance was driven by a mark-to-market on our shockwave investment and a lower effective tax rate. 
Our tax rate for Q3 was 23.4% versus 28.7% in the prior year, partly due to higher excess tax benefits in this year's rate. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. We generated $79 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. We ended December with a cash balance of $788 million, up 32% over last year with no debt. 
Our top priority for cash is to support organic growth initiatives and continue to build on our intellectual property advantage, which we believe will generate higher returns for our shareholders. To continue to provide transparency during this time, we want to give our investors color on our top line expectations for our fiscal Q4. In the first few weeks of January, the COVID pandemic worsened further impacting patient utilization. 
However, as we have experienced during the cohort era, we do expect to see recovery in patient utilization in revenue during the quarter. The patient population that we treat is high-risk and our procedures are essential. 
Although the timing is tough to call, we believe our COVID playbook allows us to treat many of these patients as they work their way back into the system. Also, we do anticipate a potential benefit as a COVID vaccine becomes more widely available and infection rates decline. With these factors in mind, we expect Q4 global revenue to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, representing 9% to 14% growth compared to Q4 of last year. 
So in summary, despite COVID headwinds, we delivered a record revenue quarter. We believe that our focused strategy will serve us and our stakeholders well on our path to delivering long-term sustainable growth with new products, new indications and new geographies. 
We are well positioned for the future with the resources to invest in innovation and clinical data while delivering strong profitability with a robust balance sheet. We are optimistic about the future. And the opportunity ahead as we continue to create the new field of heart recovery.

And even further, I'd say, escalate probably towards the end of -- the last 2 weeks of December and in the first few weeks of January. 
And so both new cases and deaths. And so for us, the impact on the hospitals and the procedural volumes because of patient fears and IC capacity. So I think, like I said, it did accelerate towards the end of December and into March -- I mean, into January right now. And so that's really what we're seeing from a trend perspective. 
With what we've seen in the past, Raj, is we know that when we do see these blips like we saw in Q2 with Florida, and we saw a little bit in Q3 in the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic, is that when we see blips, the patients typically come back. 
And again, the timing of it is tough to call, but we do expect to see some of these patients that we're missing in January come back in February and into March as well.

I'll give you as much as we can confirm, knowing that we don't have a prudent prediction yet with the FDA on the final study. We have to work our way through. The good news is this is a breakthrough product. The first 5 patients went very quickly, and we submitted to the FDA, and they approved based on the data we provided that it was -- it hit the marks for safety. 
We're now in the pilot phase. So we're now going to do another 5 centers. So we'll have 10 centers total, and we'll go to 20 patients total, which looks like, if you remember, PROTECT I, which was a 20-patient population. 
So after that, we'll submit again with a pivotal where we'll target high-risk PCI patients. We do not have confirmation about the size of that or whether or not we randomized to our own products or we're just going to compare to PROTECT III. 
We'll work directly with the FDA but what you'll be then looking at is how does the device do as compared to Impella on adverse events for access closure and safety to the valve because the concept and the indication of high-risk PCI has already been awarded to Abiomed through Impella. 
So it really will be then comparing the differences between the 2 devices and their ability to maintain hemodynamics. 
That being said, I think we're ahead of everyone's time line from what people thought was going to happen with ECP. That has to do with great execution by the team, great collaboration by the FDA and a real demand and interest by our customers to have a true 9 Frence device for high-risk PCI."

And most importantly, we've seen better outcomes, and we've seen less certain user errors. 
So historically, if a site had our support and then got in Impella Connect, we always saw a bump in outcomes, partly because it was more collaborative, and we were working with them, partly because they knew they had access to real-time information. 
And what's new is we're able to help with identification of right heart. 
[Audio Gap] 
What can 5.5 do from a growth trajectory perspective, maybe over the next couple of quarters just on its own and then potentially bringing other interventionalists in to use [Audio Gap] 
I anecdotally, we've even had patients that have been on extended support and seen recovery of their kidneys. So those are exciting trends. 
And then from an overall perspective, your second part of your question is working back and forth with interventional cardiologists, we do see our top centers, the Cedars, the Cleveland clinics, the northwestern, the Tops, I can go around the country, top heart hospitals where they combined and they partner as a hard team. 
The COVID trend that we're seeing in 2020 is there's more surgical turndown patients going to the cath lab, so we want to collaborate that heart team approach so that you can do a protected PCI, reduce the length of stay for the patient, reduce the -- having to stage the patient for 2 procedures. So that's a good benefit. 
We also see the benefit of escalating those acute on chronic patients or those AMI shock patients that need more on the left side, and we'll have more of a longer duration of weight where they're going to want to get up and walk around. So that's worked well. But in order to anticipate and collaborate and promote that more, we've created a distribution designated for the heart surgeons and heart failure, and we've actually also added a heart failure physician in the company as well. 
So we're excited now for that next opportunity of those acute on chronic patients. We also think that the unloading will have a profound impact on both acute and chronic renal failure for some of these patients, and we do see this benefit. We see this heart team collaboration."

And then, Mike, I know there's a lot going on between now and BTR with cheese and but your comment on -- I think you said first in Man, a year from now is interesting to me. Is there any way, just generally speaking, to frame up the process of studying that pump and how long it's going to take? And what are you going to compare it to an LVAD or anything along those lines because that's obviously an enormous new patient population for you. So the comment that you're getting close to first demand there is compelling to me. So I'd just love to hear a little bit more about that."

Matt, the 5.5 allows us to treat cardiomyopathy shock patients, those acute on chronic. So these are heart failure patients that have worn out hearts as compared to a patient that has a first symptom of a heart attack going into shock and ending up",443,"Sure. Matt, the 5.5 allows us to treat cardiomyopathy shock patients, those acute on chronic. So these are heart failure patients that have worn out hearts as compared to a patient that has a first symptom of a heart attack going into shock and ending up in the cath lab where they're going to open the blocked artery. 
So this is more of that heart failure population. And we feel very confident that extended unloading has a benefit. Now the Impella 5.5 is not labeled for 6 months of use even though we've had patients go a long period of time. 
And in the engineering labs, it will run consistently for more than 500 days. But you have to stay at the hospital. So it's really testing the benefit of unloading. And we do see benefit in 4 to 5 and 6 weeks of unloading. 
For the BTR, you're now talking about something that can do a similar type of unloading. And if you remember, it is an [indiscernible]. But unlike today's [indiscernible], you don't have to do a sternotomy. You don't core out the left ventricle, the Apex of the heart and take out the muscle fiber and deplete coronary flow, the device goes across the valve and pumps with the heart. So it's ideal to wean off. 
And with the sensors, we're able to see what's happening to the patient and wean off appropriately or optimally looking at wall tension. The other exciting thing is there's future adjunctive therapies whether it's Entresto, which is a great drug, whether it's stem cells or other things to come, and a duration of unloading through the axillary artery, combined with other things, we believe, is going to get a lot of these heart failure patients back. The opportunity is enormous because it's really going to target the Class 3 population that hasn't fallen off the cliff yet and become class IV. And there's tremendous new science coming around the benefits of unloading as well as some of the hormonal connections between the kidney. So more to come on that. 
From a time line, we'll wait and see, but we already have patients that are going on devices for extended period, inside and outside the U.S. and while we're not approved for bridge to transplant, based on yunos, many of them will get a transplant in 3 to 4 weeks, and they go right on to a transplant with a virgin sternum. They've been up and walking around because it's implanted through the axillary and the shoulder. And it really opens up now an opportunity for chronic heart failure that hasn't been out there before."

So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to see COVID resurgence impacting the pace of recovery, especially in January across, I would say, mostly U.S. and Europe. 
So however, as we've seen in the past, when we see patient utilization impacted, we normally see a recovery, again, although the time it is stuff to call. 
So at the low end of my range, 9%, we just assume that we see a slower pace of recovery throughout the quarter from where we are today. The high end of the range, 14% assumes some of these impacted cities and regions. 
Snap back a little bit quicker, and we get to that 14%. So that's really consistent with my guide last quarter, its low end it's slower recovery, higher end, it comes back a little bit faster in the quarter."

So I think as you go forward, you'll see our OpEx creep up. We'll continue to spend more, I would say, on physician education, can PCI in more marketing programs. So I think you'll see it bounce up a little bit over the next couple of quarters. And that's all I could say at this point in time.

We have had selected commercials over the years where we align in with protected PCI centers. What we're doing now is really more of a general awareness campaign where we're partnering with the local hospitals. We're talking to the society, specifically Sky is the Interventional Cardiology Society and the Chairman of Sky is Dr. Cindy Grines, and so she has given several talks on the benefits of treating these essential patients and the need. 
Sky also conducted a survey a national survey. And it showed that patient anxiety was keeping people from going to the hospital. One of the points was 51% of the people in the survey did not feel comfortable scheduling a medical procedure during COVID-19. So we're running these commercials. We're getting positive feedback both from the hospitals, our customers because, again, they are general awareness, but it allows us then to connect those patients that need to be treated. 
And to be clear, our high-risk PCI patients are not elective. They're essential. They're classified by CMS and by the societies as essential because these people are having chest pain, in many cases, they're admitted to the hospital. 
And what I would remind our investors that we try to be so transparent and give you as much detail as we can on our patients. There is a gray area between a high-risk PCI patient, an urgent patient that has non Stemi that's admitted to the hospital decompensating and someone having an AMI going into shock because of a blockage or because of a virus. So we always give you the top numbers. 
We try to break it down, but there's certainly now a blending of all of those together. And again, these people need to be treated, and they have a high mortality rate if they're not treated. And so that's what the message is for. But we have stepped it up, and we're going to maintain it into the next fiscal year because we think it's very helpful overall."

We are planting seeds in a lot of different countries around the world. If you think about Singapore and Hong Kong and India and the Middle East and just a variety of them. And so the gating item for us in these countries is reimbursement. So we'll typically go into these countries, work with some of the key opinion leaders, work with the physician societies, and just -- it's a long sales process.

And just to clarify, sometimes it's a confusing thing for some investors is smart assist, all the software we have on the system itself allows us to -- when we log in to see that and to utilize that and talk to the physicians about that, it helps us predict things such as potential right heart failure. 
Impella Connect, once the information is in the cloud and it's streaming, it allows us to do artificial intelligence and collect the data. And so that can be done at a quicker pace. That means on some of those tools, we can do it from our phone or iPad. We don't have to go out to every single center and log and add that software to all the consoles. 
And so the analogy I give is smart assist is Cobra Kai and Impella Connect is Netflix. And so we're going to strike hard, and we're going to try to do everything we can at the hospital bed side with smartest says, but the ability for artificial intelligence to take data from all over the world on our patients and match it with outcomes to X plan will give us tools in the future that we may add for or may add to charge for. But currently, because of COVID, everything is given away. All the hardware has already been put in our cost of goods. That's why we have 500 sites. 
We just have to turn on the WiFi. And we know that making ease of use and better outcomes is the formula for success, is the formula for adoption. Longer term, we will have some new models. For AI, we might have new models guaranteeing certain outcomes, whether it's improved EF or high-risk PCI or reduction of readmissions for high-risk PCI or maybe even better outcomes. And if someone commits to follow the protocols and report that data, we can provide more of these AI tools. So it's a lot of opportunity. 
We already have a very good gross margin. We're already profitable. So we're going to do things that make the best sense for the patient and our customers. Because, again, we believe we're going to be the standard of care for high-risk PCI and shock in the short term, and then we're going to expand on all these other indications later."

So you can imagine in the COVID environment with restrictions it's a pretty great tool when our clinical rep in the field, all of a sudden gets to text and it tells them that there's a patient on support at this hospital, they can click on the button, and they can see the console immediately and watch how the patient is doing. So as they drive to the hospital or as they get a call from the physician, in real time, they're looking at what's happening. So that's the big part. AI is certainly gaining a lot of traction in the medical community. 
Really, the only challenge is people that have cybersecurity concerns. And what we do is we explain to them, the Impella connect and our software is FDA approved, is HIPAA compliant. It's a one-way transmit out so that it's not hackable back in and we just got to continue to work with them. And it allows us to really do a great job of connecting their outcomes with their questions. 
And on the same Impella Connect portal, we can look up a patient, meaning a physician, we can look up how they've done in the past, what type of patients, we can look up hospitals. It gives us a level of information that allows us to help them improve their outcomes and that's the key to these tools and the software. It's really ease of use and better outcomes but the level that we go down is to start with our benefit to our people, benefit to the physicians, and we just have to overcome a little bit of the IT fear at the hospital."

At Abiomed, we continue to remain both focused and committed to our mission of recovering hearts and saving lives despite the challenging COVID environment. I want to thank our employees and our customers around the world and recognize their determination and efforts under these circumstances. 
Abiomed delivered a record quarter of $232 million in revenue up 5% year-over-year. We generated revenue growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe and Japan, despite the COVID resurgence. Operationally, we were disciplined and focused on executing our fiscal year tactical plan with multiple regulatory milestones and 2 first in-human clinical studies. We achieved a 31% operating margin while investing at record levels of $33 million in research and development. Our balance sheet strengthened to a robust $788 million in cash while maintaining 0 debt. 
We also achieved a significant milestone this quarter as we surpassed over 1,000 Impella patents and currently have 851 patents pending. We believe Abiomed has 1 of the strongest IP portfolios in the medical device industry. In summary, we executed our plan and had a solid quarter. 
For today's call, I'm going to provide 3 updates. First, I will outline our transition to the green phase in Q4 by leveraging our Abiomed 2.0 COVID Playbook. 
Second, I will highlight the robust clinical data released in October. And finally, I will discuss our momentum with new products and regulatory approvals. So first, as a reminder to investors, we designated a 3 Phase red, yellow, green approach for FY '21 to address the evolving COVID-19 environment. 
In the Q3 yellow phase, we were focused on the acceleration of Abiomed 2.0 as we endured the pandemic. This enabled us to achieve our tactical plan, and reduce the COVID impact on our commercial performance. These initiatives were accomplished without sacrificing our commitment to employee health or safety. We ramped up our on-site antigen and PCR testing in both Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany for early virus detection and administered thousands of COVID tests. 
This proactive testing reduced employee anxiety and allowed us to get production back to full capacity to build essential life-saving heart pumps during a record quarter in our 40-year history as a company. 
Because we provide essential patient support and training to our hospitals, more than 25% of our U.S. field teams has received the COVID-19 vaccine from their local customers. We look forward to that number growing as the vaccine becomes more available in the months ahead for headquarters employees. 
In Q3, we executed on the milestones we control and grew revenue across all geographies. As a whole, hospitals today are managing better than they have previously during the pandemic with more testing, better protocols and vaccinated caregivers. This allows for better patient management and treatment of both COVID and non-COVID patients. However, the virus resurgence in mid-November impacted utilization, especially in the U.S. due to ICU capacity and patient anxiety about seeking in-hospital treatment. 
At this point, we believe our Abiomed 2.0 COVID playbook will allow for a green phase transition in Q4 despite their early January ramp-up in COVID cases. This playbook allows for patient monitoring in the cloud and makes our people more productive and valuable for the hospital. 
Our Impella Connect online capability is now live at 686 hospitals in the U.S., and there are an additional 500 ready-to-connect, once hospitals approve, WiFi access. 
Today, more than half of our U.S. patients are monitored in the cloud with Impella Connect. This enables best-in-class 24/7 support on-site, on-call and online. 
As part of our Abiomed 2.0 playbook, we monitor global and local trends at a state, city and hospital level on Impella usage, new COVID cases and ICU capacity. 
This enables our flexibility with our people and resources to adapt quickly to essential patients. We have been working with physician societies as well as hospitals to reinforce the importance and benefits of treating essential high-risk in cardiogenic shocked patients. 
Also, we are investing in educating the public with both online and broadcast TV commercials to encourage patients to seek treatment for their heart disease. 
Turning to my second topic, new clinical data. In October at CCT Connect, we received and reviewed a robust set of clinical data showing improvement in outcomes. For high-risk Impella supported PCI, data from PROTECT III and RESTORE EF demonstrated statistically improved outcomes including better safety and improved heart function post treatment. 
The improvement in heart function with more complete revascularization is now objectively proven in high-risk PCI with Impella support. The PROTECT IV Physician Executive Committee has locked the study protocol, and we have already initiated site visits with first patient enrolled targeted for next quarter, Q1. 
We are grateful to these physician experts for the last year of study design work and affirmation of protected PCI best practices. For cardiogenic shock, we continue to see improvements in survival, validated using best practice protocols, such as placing the Impella before the PCI and minimizing inotropes. 
These best practices have been generated over the last 5 years and were derived from multiple prospective physician studies and real-world evidence, including FDA studies. These 2020 updated cardiogenic shock best practices now include early identification of right heart failure with SmartAssist software and escalation to BIPELLA support with Impella RP. 
Within the quarter, Impella RP revenue grew 21% versus prior year due to strength in patient utilization and expanded FDA emergency youth authorization for COVID complications, including pulmonary embolism. 
Recent studies in both Italy and Japan have also contributed to the validation of our cardiogenic shock protocols. As a countrywide initiative, Japan now has one of the highest survival rates for cardiogenic shock in the world, 77% survival and over 90% native heart recovery in survivors. 
To note, just 4 years ago, the CULPRIT study from top European heart hospitals published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported a 50% survival for cardiogenic shock patients using all devices as salvage post-PCI. These higher survival rates contributed to Japan's sales performance, up 38% in revenue year-over-year despite COVID. 
Moving to regulatory approvals and new products, our third and final topic, we made significant progress with 2, 510(k) clearances and 2 first in-MAN studies completed within the quarter. We received 510(k) clearance for ECMO Breethe Oxy-1 System and treated our first 8 patients with a mix of BV, VA and ECPELLA cases in the United States. 
The feedback has been positive, highlighting the ease of use, portability of the console and early mobilization. Additionally, we achieved 2 important milestones toward breaking the small bore barrier to reduce physician access and closure concerns. 
First, we completed the first 5 patients from our U.S. FDA early feasibility study for the Impella ECP, a true 9 French pump ideal for high-risk protected PCI. 
This safety data was submitted to the FDA and approved as sufficient data to support the expansion of the Impella ECP trial to 5 more hospitals and 15 more patients. Second, we received 510(k) clearance for the Impella XR Sheath with the Impella 2.5 heart pump. We treated 8 patients with the XR Sheath outside of the U.S. in Q3 and and have now transitioned the majority of our focus to the Impella CP for both 510(k) clearance and PMA supplements. 
The XR Sheath has flexible night knoll braids that momentarily expand during Impella delivery then recoil, reducing closure, challenges and complications at the access site. These milestones are important steps to drive ease of use, expand our customer base and continue to drive better patient outcomes. 
However, it is important to note that bleeding and vascular complications in PROTECT III, our FDA study, were less than 2% for both showing the technical and clinical progress made over time with training, education and innovation. Our surgical platform continues to deliver strong performance, driven by the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist. Our Impella 5.5 is a minimally-invasive, forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant directly with the chest open, or through the axillary artery to avoid an invasive sternotomy. 
We created a dedicated surgical and heart failure team focused on heart recovery for acutely decompensating heart failure patients in shock. This week at the surgical STS conference Dr. Ed Soltesz from Cleveland Clinic presented data from a large study of 356 Impella 5.5 patients at 16 hospitals in the U.S. and Germany. The study found a 79% survival rate with the majority of surviving patients recovering their native heart. 
In Q3, our U.S. Surgical business grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. We have now treated more than 1,000 patients with the Impella 5.5 and demonstrated an improvement in patient outcomes compared to historical rates. 
While the Impella 5.5 has exceeded a run time of more than 500 days in our engineering labs, the Impella BTR pump is designed to run for more than 1 year and allow for home discharge with patient metrics in the cloud. The Impella BTR pump is now 1 year away from our anticipated first-in-human study. 
Both 5.5 and BTR have ideal designs because they are minimally invasive via the axillary artery and pump with the heart providing optimal weaning capability and improved forward flow to the kidneys. 
I would like to end with a patient story from the summer. In August, Chavez Adams, a 29-year old lawyer from North Carolina, tested positive for COVID-19 and quarantine for 2 weeks. In September, Chavez has developed a fever and went to his local urgent clinical care, where they found his heart was racing above normal, and he passed out. Chavez was immediately admitted to WakeMed Health with an injection fraction less than 20% and went into cardiogenic shock. 
Dr. Nupani, and his team determined Chavez was experiencing cardiogenic shock for myocarditis, likely due to COVID 19. The Impella CP was implanted to allow his heart to rest. After 3 days of support, the Impella was weaned and ex-planted and care was covered by Blue Cross, Blue Shield. 
Chavez has returned home with his native heart and now has a normal heart function. Today, he is back at work and enjoying an active lifestyle with his wife, Ashley. 
In conclusion, Abiomed, with our dedicated customers continues to improve patient outcomes, documented in global clinical studies, which are posted on our website, as we advance our product portfolio and best practices. As we enter the final quarter of FY '21, we remain focused on achieving our tactical plan and transitioning to the green phase. 
Abiomed is a stronger company today than before the COVID pandemic and is uniquely focused on recovering hearts and saving lives for growing high-risk populations. We are excited to close Q4 as Abiomed 2.0 and enter FY '22 with our best ever clinical outcomes from existing products, existing indications and existing countries. 
Next fiscal year, Abiomed will expand into new products, new studies, new indications and new countries. I am sincerely proud of our employees and grateful to our customers who put patients first every day. 
We also appreciate the continued support of our investors and remain focused on growing shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

As Mike mentioned, in Q3, we delivered a record revenue quarter for the company of $232 million, an increase of 5% versus prior year. While our business continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 trends, we were able to deliver positive year-over-year revenue growth in our top 3 markets by sticking with the priorities in our COVID playbook, remaining focused in leveraging our strengths for operating in this uncertain environment. 
By region, the U.S. reported revenue of $189 million, up 2% versus prior year primarily due to positive sales mix. U.S. patient utilization was down 2% year-over-year. However, we had tough comps last year in October, especially for cardiogenic shock. As Mike mentioned, the COVID-19 resurgence impacted continued recovery in patient utilization during the quarter. 
We started to see a broad-based impact from the resurgence beginning in mid-November. Our ability to track COVID cases and ITU capacity at local levels enabled us to see trends between higher new cases and ICU capacity and the impact utilization and recovery. During the quarter, we were able to adapt and saw some areas begin to recover. 
At the end of December, in the U.S., the CP is now in 1,492 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 660 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 158 sites, up 37 sites versus prior quarter. 
We believe that all 1,100 heart hospitals will acquire this breakthrough technology. Our controlled rollout of the Impella 5.5 continues to deliver strong performance as our U.S. surgical portfolio reported a 48% increase in revenue versus prior year. 
The Impella RP is now in 569 sites, up 17 sites versus Q2. RP had a strong quarter with revenue increasing 21% versus prior year, driven by patient utilization. As a reminder, in July, the FDA issued an EUA to expand the use of Impella RP to include patients suffering from COVID-19 related right ventricular complications, which is a great validation for this life saving device. 
In the quarter, the reorder rate was 104%, the same percentage as the prior year. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.7 units per site as compared to 4.6 in the prior quarter. 
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $43 million, up 18% year-over-year. Our European revenue increased 12% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization in several key markets, including Germany, Switzerland and Italy and a benefit from the Euro-U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. 
Within the quarter, both high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock grew mid-single digits. In Europe, we started to see an impact from the COVID resurgence early in the quarter. When certain countries began issuing national lockdowns. However, we were able to pivot our strategy and began to see some recovery in patient utilization in mid-November through December. 
The COVID pandemic continues to remain uncertain with differences by country on the timing of the recovery. In Japan, we had another strong quarter and delivered $12 million in revenue, up 38% over prior year, driven by higher patient utilization. We opened 14 new sites during the quarter. Bringing our total to 156 sites out of the potential 350 Impella hospitals. We did see an impact in November as COVID cases began to rise however, we saw some recovery in December. 
Japan's performance has remained more resilient than other countries during the pandemic because our patients are mostly in cardiogenic shock. Japan also has been able to leverage their best practice protocols in the COVID environment in order to treat shock patients, recover their native hearts and deliver record survival rates. Moving to key financial metrics. 
Our gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by higher production volumes, which more than offset the investment to accelerate the rollout of Impella Connect. 
One of our main objectives in our red, yellow, green approach to navigating the COVID environment is to continue innovating and investing as we execute our strategy and our tactical plan. 
During the third quarter, R&D expense increased 29% versus prior year to $33 million. We believe our targeted investments in technology and clinical data are critical for improving patient outcomes and sustaining long-term growth. SG&A expense for the third quarter totaled $86 million, up 1% versus prior year. We are managing our discretionary costs while continuing to invest in marketing, and training programs, including camp PCI and targeted advertising and to provide a safe environment for our employees. 
In the quarter, our costs included over $0.5 million for COVID testing and PPE for our people. This spend is being offset from lower expenses such as T&E and trade shows, among other postponed activities in the current environment. 
In the quarter, operating income grew 2% to $71 million, translating to an operating margin of 30.8%. And we delivered strong margins while making the necessary investments to support future growth. GAAP net income for the quarter was $62 million or $1.35 per diluted share versus $69 million or $1.51 in Q3 of '20. 
The year-over-year variance was driven by a mark-to-market on our Shockwave investment and a lower effective tax rate. Our tax rate for Q3 was 23.4% versus 28.7% in the prior year, partly due to higher excess tax benefits in this year's rate. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We generated $79 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. We ended December with a cash balance of $788 million, up 32% over last year with no debt. 
Our top priority for cash is to support organic growth initiatives and continue to build on our intellectual property advantage, which we believe will generate higher returns for our shareholders. To continue to provide transparency during this time, we want to give our investors color on our top line expectations for our fiscal Q4. In the first few weeks of January, the COVID pandemic worsened further impacting patient utilization. 
However, as we have experienced during the cohort era, we do expect to see recovery in patient utilization in revenue during the quarter. The patient population that we treat is high-risk and our procedures are essential. 
Although the timing is tough to call, we believe our COVID playbook allows us to treat many of these patients as they work their way back into the system. Also, we do anticipate a potential benefit as a COVID vaccine becomes more widely available and infection rates decline. With these factors in mind, we expect Q4 global revenue to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, representing 9% to 14% growth compared to Q4 of last year. 
So in summary, despite COVID headwinds, we delivered a record revenue quarter. We believe that our focused strategy will serve us and our stakeholders well on our path to delivering long-term sustainable growth with new products, new indications and new geographies. 
We are well positioned for the future with the resources to invest in innovation and clinical data while delivering strong profitability with a robust balance sheet. We are optimistic about the future. And the opportunity ahead as we continue to create the new field of heart recovery.

And even further, I'd say, escalate probably towards the end of -- the last 2 weeks of December and in the first few weeks of January. 
And so both new cases and deaths. And so for us, the impact on the hospitals and the procedural volumes because of patient fears and ICU capacity. So I think, like I said, it did accelerate towards the end of December and into March -- I mean, into January right now. And so that's really what we're seeing from a trend perspective. 
With what we've seen in the past, Raj, is we know that when we do see these blips like we saw in Q2 with Florida, and we saw a little bit in Q3 in the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic, is that when we see blips, the patients typically come back. 
And again, the timing of it is tough to call, but we do expect to see some of these patients that we're missing in January come back in February and into March as well. 
Okay. And Raj, just to be clear, the forecast, the range I've given, 9% to 14%, it takes into effect what we saw in the month of January."

I'll give you as much as we can confirm, knowing that we don't have a prudent prediction yet with the FDA on the final study. We have to work our way through. The good news is this is a breakthrough product. The first 5 patients went very quickly, and we submitted to the FDA, and they approved based on the data we provided that it was -- it hit the marks for safety. 
We're now in the pilot phase. So we're now going to do another 5 centers. So we'll have 10 centers total, and we'll go to 20 patients total, which looks like, if you remember, PROTECT I, which was a 20-patient population. 
So after that, we'll submit again with a pivotal where we'll target high-risk PCI patients. We do not have confirmation about the size of that or whether or not we randomized to our own products or we're just going to compare to PROTECT III. 
We'll work directly with the FDA but what you'll be then looking at is how does the device do as compared to Impella on adverse events for access closure and safety to the valve because the concept and the indication of high-risk PCI has already been awarded to Abiomed through Impella. 
So it really will be then comparing the differences between the 2 devices and their ability to maintain hemodynamics. 
That being said, I think we're ahead of everyone's time line from what people thought was going to happen with ECP. That has to do with great execution by the team, great collaboration by the FDA and a real demand and interest by our customers to have a true 9 Frence device for high-risk PCI."

So the 5.5 in is smaller and thinner than the 5.0. It's a new technology platform. It also has a sensor on it. So it's actually easier to place to the actually already or if the chest is open for a patient coming off a heart-lung machine after open heart surgery, they can drop in indirect. And it's designed for surgeons. 
And so there's a huge demand for a minimally invasive weanable full pump, and that's what the Impella 5.5 is. Part of the new population that we can treat with it is this acute on chronic patient population. So we estimate conservatively, there's another 100,000 of these patients in the U.S. that's a subset of the almost 2 million Class III, Class IV patients. So that's an exciting component. 
Now we are opening new centers, but we don't tend to put a lot of inventory on the shelf because we don't do consignment. And we are seeing just a strong growth in utilization overall. And most important, we're seeing the best outcomes historically documented for acute on chronic heart failure patients. Anecdotally, we've even had patients that have been on extended support and seen recovery of their kidneys. So those are exciting trends. 
And then from an overall perspective, your second part of your question is working back and forth with interventional cardiologists, we do see our top centers, the Cedars, the Cleveland clinics, the Northwestern's, the Tops, I can go around the country, top heart hospitals where they combined and they partner as a hard team. 
The COVID trend that we're seeing in 2020 is there's more surgical turndown patients going to the cath lab, so we want to collaborate that heart team approach so that you can do a protected PCI, reduce the length of stay for the patient, reduce the -- having to stage the patient for 2 procedures. So that's a good benefit. 
We also see the benefit of escalating those acute on chronic patients or those AMI shock patients that need more on the left side, and we'll have more of a longer duration of weight where they're going to want to get up and walk around. So that's worked well. But in order to anticipate and collaborate and promote that more, we've created a distribution designated for the heart surgeons and heart failure, and we've actually also added a heart failure physician in the company as well. 
So we're excited now for that next opportunity of those acute on chronic patients. We also think that the unloading will have a profound impact on both acute and chronic renal failure for some of these patients, and we do see this benefit. We see this heart team collaboration."

Matt, the 5.5 allows us to treat cardiomyopathy shock patients, those acute on chronic. So these are heart failure patients that have worn out hearts as compared to a patient that has a first symptom of a heart attack going into shock and ending up in the cath lab where they're going to open the blocked artery. 
So this is more of that heart failure population. And we feel very confident that extended unloading has a benefit. Now the Impella 5.5 is not labeled for 6 months of use even though we've had patients go a long period of time. 
And in the engineering labs, it will run consistently for more than 500 days. But you have to stay at the hospital. So it's really testing the benefit of unloading. And we do see benefit in 4 to 5 and 6 weeks of unloading. 
For the BTR, you're now talking about something that can do a similar type of unloading. And if you remember, it is an LVAD, but unlike today's LVADs, you don't have to do a sternotomy. You don't core out the left ventricle, the Apex of the heart and take out the muscle fiber and deplete coronary flow, the device goes across the valve and pumps with the heart. So it's ideal to wean off. 
And with the sensors, we're able to see what's happening to the patient and wean off appropriately or optimally looking at wall tension. The other exciting thing is there's future adjunctive therapies whether it's Entresto, which is a great drug, whether it's stem cells or other things to come, and a duration of unloading through the axillary artery, combined with other things, we believe, is going to get a lot of these heart failure patients back. The opportunity is enormous because it's really going to target the Class 3 population that hasn't fallen off the cliff yet and become class IV. And there's tremendous new science coming around the benefits of unloading as well as some of the hormonal connections between the kidney. So more to come on that. 
From a timeline, we'll wait and see, but we already have patients that are going on devices for extended period, inside and outside the U.S. and while we're not approved for bridge to transplant, based on as you know, many of them will get a transplant in 3 to 4 weeks, and they go right on to a transplant with a virgin sternum. They've been up and walking around because it's implanted through the axillary and the shoulder. And it really opens up now an opportunity for chronic heart failure that hasn't been out there before."

High-risk PCI was up 4%, shock was up 6%. 
And I would say that's sort of the reconciliation. We saw some nice performance, I would say, out of Switzerland, Germany, Italy, continue to see I would say, patient growth in those areas, and they were being offset by some of the hardest hit countries like U.K., France and Belgium, which were down obviously, double digits. So a little bit of uneven growth over in Europe, but overall, pretty pretty strong growth overall when you think about with COVID and what's going on over there."

We have had selected commercials over the years where we align in with protected PCI centers. What we're doing now is really more of a general awareness campaign where we're partnering with the local hospitals. We're talking to the societies, specifically SCAI is the Interventional Cardiology Society and the Chairman of SCAI is Dr. Cindy Grines, and so she has given several talks on the benefits of treating these essential patients and the need. 
SCAI also conducted a survey a national survey. And it showed that patient anxiety was keeping people from going to the hospital. One of the points was 51% of the people in the survey did not feel comfortable scheduling a medical procedure during COVID-19. So we're running these commercials. We're getting positive feedback both from the hospitals, our customers because, again, they are general awareness, but it allows us then to connect those patients that need to be treated. 
And to be clear, our high-risk PCI patients are not elective. They're essential. They're classified by CMS and by the societies as essential because these people are having chest pain, in many cases, they're admitted to the hospital. 
And what I would remind our investors that we try to be so transparent and give you as much detail as we can on our patients. There is a gray area between a high-risk PCI patient, an urgent patient that has non-STEMI that's admitted to the hospital decompensating and someone having an AMI going into shock because of a blockage or because of a virus. So we always give you the top numbers. 
We try to break it down, but there's certainly now a blending of all of those together. And again, these people need to be treated, and they have a high mortality rate if they're not treated. And so that's what the message is for. But we have stepped it up, and we're going to maintain it into the next fiscal year because we think it's very helpful overall."

Catalysts on some new indications, going after this acute and chronic heart failure population. We'll be collecting more data and submitting for VT ablation in the EP lab. And then, of course, we've got the XR Sheath to help minimize access closure concerns.

Impella Connect, once the information is in the cloud and it's streaming, it allows us to do artificial intelligence and collect the data. And so that can be done at a quicker pace. That means on some of those tools, we can do it from our phone or iPad. We don't have to go out to every single center and log and add that software to all the consoles. 
And so the analogy I give is smart assist is Cobra Kai and Impella Connect is Netflix. And so we're going to strike hard, and we're going to try to do everything we can at the hospital bed side with smartest says, but the ability for artificial intelligence to take data from all over the world on our patients and match it with outcomes to X plan will give us tools in the future that we may add for or may add to charge for. But currently, because of COVID, everything is given away. All the hardware has already been put in our cost of goods. That's why we have 500 sites. 
We just have to turn on the WiFi. And we know that making ease of use and better outcomes is the formula for success, is the formula for adoption. Longer term, we will have some new models. For AI, we might have new models guaranteeing certain outcomes, whether it's improved EF or high-risk PCI or reduction of readmissions for high-risk PCI or maybe even better outcomes. And if someone commits to follow the protocols and report that data, we can provide more of these AI tools. So it's a lot of opportunity. 
We already have a very good gross margin. We're already profitable. So we're going to do things that make the best sense for the patient and our customers. Because, again, we believe we're going to be the standard of care for high-risk PCI and shock in the short term, and then we're going to expand on all these other indications later."

So as they drive to the hospital or as they get a call from the physician, in real time, they're looking at what's happening. So that's the big part. AI is certainly gaining a lot of traction in the medical community. 
Really, the only challenge is people that have cybersecurity concerns. And what we do is we explain to them, the Impella connect and our software is FDA approved, is HIPAA compliant. It's a one-way transmit out so that it's not hackable back in and we just got to continue to work with them. And it allows us to really do a great job of connecting their outcomes with their questions. 
And on the same Impella Connect portal, we can look up a patient, meaning a physician, we can look up how they've done in the past, what type of patients, we can look up hospitals. It gives us a level of information that allows us to help them improve their outcomes and that's the key to these tools and the software. It's really ease of use and better outcomes but the level that we go down is to start with our benefit to our people, benefit to the physicians, and we just have to overcome a little bit of the IT fear at the hospital."

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Abiomed has remained on course to advance our innovation and become the standard of care for circulatory support. We adapted and executed while successfully transitioning from our red, yellow and green phases to Abiomed 2.0. The 2.0 marks our transformation into a smarter and more connected online medical device company with a COVID playbook. We conduct on-site and online training and education and provide patients support with smart algorithms to track real-world utilization in the cloud, identify best practices and optimize patient care. 
For the quarter, Abiomed delivered a company record of $241 million in revenue, up 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth and record revenue across the U.S., Europe and Japan. Within the quarter, we saw monthly sequential improvement in both global revenue and patient utilization. Q4 investments continued while achieving a 26% GAAP operating margin. Applying our Abiomed 2.0 COVID playbook, we definitively transitioned to the green phase validated with record number of patients supported in a quarter, in a month, in a week and in a day all in Q4. 
Turning to the full fiscal year. Abiomed delivered $848 million in revenue, up 1% year-over-year and 27% operating margin despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We took a disciplined approach to the fiscal year to help us navigate the uncertain environment and achieve our tactical plan. Over the past year, we endured the setbacks of COVID-19 and focused on keeping employees safe, making life, saving heart pumps and supporting our hospitals and patients. We controlled expenses and invested in innovation, new clinical studies and expanded distribution while remaining fiscally responsible. 
Our balance sheet strengthened to $848 million in cash, while maintaining 0 debt and acquiring an ECMO platform. In addition, our IP portfolio increased to 1,150 Impella patents and 940 patents pending. We achieved a significant number of regulatory approvals and established world-class online training and education with CAMP PCI. 
At Abiomed, our patient's first mindset gives us purpose and courage and we always seek opportunities to lead, manage, adapt and execute. For this fiscal year, I would like to thank our employees and customers for their courage, dedication to patients and leadership throughout the pandemic. We exited the year slightly up in revenue, profitable and stronger than ever before. For today's call, I will highlight our fiscal '21 innovation that will drive our success and momentum into our fiscal year '22 goals and beyond. 
In fiscal year '21, Abiomed launched revolutionary innovation across multiple patient populations. Starting with the accelerated rollout of Impella Connect, our remote monitoring capability, allowing us to go live at nearly 1,000 hospitals in the U.S. Currently, 70% of our patients are monitored in the cloud with Impella Connect. No other company in our space provides this level of 24/7 on site, on call and online support. This is particularly meaningful in the COVID environment. We have also expanded our global footprint with Impella Connect at 29 hospitals in Germany and 49 hospitals in Japan. 
Next, the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist, continues to deliver strong results. Within the quarter, our U.S. Surgical revenue grew 46% year-over-year as we expanded this device to 53 more sites totaling 211 sites. For the full fiscal year, U.S. Surgical revenue grew 44% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. The Impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product because it is minimally invasive, provides forward flow and is a fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons. It is inserted via the axillary artery or directly into the aorta and designed for longer duration support with patient ambulations. The Impella 5.5 has reported comparatively higher survival rates and native heart recovery for the acutely decompensating heart failure patient population, representing an additional 100,000 treatable U.S. patients. Heart surgeons are also enthusiastic about our BTR heart pump, first-in-human experience expected in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. 
Turning to our Abiomed Breethe Oxy-1 System, we have now treated 20 patients to date at several sites. In March, I visited our Breethe facility in Baltimore, and met a Breethe ECMO patient on support at the nearby University of Maryland Medical Center. The feedback from physicians on this innovative compact cardiopulmonary bypass system has been positive. Customers highlight the ease of use with the simple intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for ambulation. We will continue to innovate and plan to optimize this technology with Smart Ecpella software and connected cloud monitoring. 
Moving on to our regulatory progress. We advanced our U.S. FDA early feasibility study for the Impella ECP, a true 9 French heart pump. As a reminder, in early Q4, we received FDA approval for the expansion of the early feasibility study to 20 patients and have enrolled 10 patients to date. The excitement for PROTECT IV is palatable in the heart failure community, and we recently announced our first patient enrolled at Ascension St. John Hospital in Detroit. It is important to note that PROTECT IV was designed by the leaders and best clinical trialists in the field of cardiovascular medicine. It is an on label prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that is designed to provide the level of clinical evidence needed to achieve a global Class I guideline recommendation for Impella in high-risk PCI in the future. The intent of PROTECT IV RCT, is to leverage and validate the best practices that we have learned over the past 10 years in the PROTECT series and CVAD studies that led to the exclusive FDA PMA approval of Impella for high-risk PCI. We believe the heart failure communities engagement will propel the PROTECT IV study to be a landmark trial for high-risk PCI overall as a new treatment alternative. 
In the past, we have defined our current addressable market for high-risk PCI as 121,000 U.S. patients. As a result of the PROTECT IV study, we are directly investing this year in outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the undertreated population of an additional 319,000 high-risk PCI patients that are turned down for surgery and not referred for protected PCI treatment due to not being diagnosed or tested for coronary artery disease. Since the PROTECT IV study is on label, and spans the heart team, we now estimate our new U.S. addressable patient population for high-risk PCI to be 440,000 patients. 
For context, 15 million people in the U.S. have coronary artery disease and heart failure, and it causes approximately 1 million deaths per year. Coronary or disease and heart failure remains the leading cause of death overall. And is the #1 cause of death for people with type 2 diabetes. While we will not complete this study in fiscal year '22, we now have line of sight and a path forward to solidify the new standard of care for high-risk PCI with the goal of complete revascularization and improvement in patient quality of life and ejection fraction. 
Finally, I want to highlight some of our goals for Abiomed 2.0 fiscal '22 and beyond with investments focused on extending our lead in innovation, advancing Impella clinical evidence and establishing commercial excellence with a premier distribution team. First, we will continue to invest in R&D as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies that are smaller, smarter and connected to improve ease of use and clinical outcomes. Second, we plan to execute multiple RCTs, including STEMI DTU, PROTECT IV and advance the recover for cardiogenic shock design with the goal of achieving Class 1 guidelines overall. In addition, we expect to further validate the safety and efficacy of Impella and the importance of complete revascularization in high-risk PCI with the publications of PROTECT III and RESTORE EF. For cardiogenic shock, positive clinical results presented yesterday at the Sky scientific sessions for the physician-initiated national carding shock initiative will be published. Separately, the positive results presented by the MHLW, Pvad Japanese heart committee will also be published. Because these cardiogenic shock patients are difficult to randomize and consent our best practice protocols are derived from over 10 years of real-world evidence and over 100,000 patients with physician-initiated and prospective FDA and PMDA studies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. This new paradigm focuses on improved survival and native heart recovery. And finally, through a combination of our U.S. distribution expansion and leveraging CAMP PCI, we plan to deliver best-in-class training and education, on-site and online, with the goal of identifying patients, improving outcomes and driving Impella adoption. 
Before I conclude, I want to share a patient story. Chris Kirkman, a 48-year old husband, father and sales director from Zachary, Louisiana has a family history of heart disease and has lived with hypertension for 20 years. In December 2020, after experiencing shortness of breath, fluid buildup around his abdomen and difficulty sleeping, Chris visited a local emergency clinic. He was prescribed medication and sent home. Chris's symptoms gradually became more severe over the next few months when he experienced trouble breathing, Chris's wife drove him to the local hospital where he was diagnosed with advanced coronary disease and congestive heart failure with poor ejection fraction at 20%. He was told he was too high-risk for bypass surgery and discharges home with a wearable defibrillator. Chris was then referred to interventional cardiologists, Dr. Abraham, at Baton Routes General Blue Bonnet. Dr. Abraham identified Chris as an appropriate candidate for protected PCI with Impella. When he returned for the scheduled procedure, Dr. Abraham successfully achieved complete revaccination with the help of Impella CP heart pump, and Chris was discharged home the next day. During his follow-up exam, Chris' ejection fraction improved to 45%. Today, Chris is thankful to be back at work and enjoying a healthier lifestyle with his wife and 3 children. 
In conclusion, I'm very proud of our employees and customers for their dedication and courage during the COVID pandemic. Despite the challenging of circumstances on both professional and personal levels, Abiomed 2.0 delivered 1 of our most productive fiscal years in my 17-year tenure as CEO. I am confident that Abiomed will not just be a successful company. But will drive a new standard of care for multiple growing populations of high-risk heart failure patients around the world. We look to the new fiscal year with great excitement because we are a stronger company today and have a clear path for execution to fulfill our heart recovery mission. And last, we sincerely appreciate the continued support from our patients, customers and shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

We leveraged our Abiom",1328,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Now starting with Q4 results. As Mike mentioned, we delivered record revenue of $241 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and Japan. We leveraged our Abiomed 2.0 COVID playbook, which allowed us to transition to the green phase, where we grew patients and revenue year-over-year and delivered on our innovation, regulatory and clinical milestones despite the current environment. 
Turning to our regional performance. U.S. revenue grew 13% to $196 million, driven by a 13% increase in patient utilization. We saw double-digit growth in both high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. The pandemic hit peak levels in the first few weeks of January, which impacted patient utilization. However, as COVID cases and related hospitalizations began to decline and we executed our playbook, we delivered sequential improvements in patients and revenue in each month of the quarter. We also set a patient and revenue record in March. 
At the end of our fiscal Q4 in the U.S., the CP is now in 1,509 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 663 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 211 sites, up 53 sites versus prior quarter. 
Lastly, the Impella RP is now in 588 sites, up 19 versus Q3. U.S. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly below 100% and average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was 4.7 units per site, consistent with the inventory levels we saw in Q3. 
Turning to outside the U.S. in Q4, total revenue was $46 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strength in Europe and Japan. Our European revenue increased 28% year-over-year due to higher patient utilization in several markets, such as Germany, Austria and the U.K. and a benefit from the Euro-U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. Similar to the U.S., in Europe, we saw an impact in January, when certain countries mandated lockdowns as COVID cases and deaths accelerated. However, here too, we leveraged the COVID playbook, executed on our plan and delivered monthly sequential improvement throughout the quarter. 
Japan continues to perform very well, delivering $11.6 million in revenue, up 38% year-over-year, driven by patient utilization. We opened 10 new sites in the quarter, bringing our total to 166 sites. Moving forward, gross margin for Q4 was 80.9%, flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from increased production volume, offsetting higher material spend and stock-based compensation. 
R&D expense totaled $32 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year. The value of our ongoing innovation has been evident throughout the past year, and we believe it will continue to create value as we invest in advancing the Impella ECP, exar sheet, Breethe Oxy-1 system and Impella BTR and in clinical evidence with PROTECT IV, STEMI DTU and Danger. 
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $100 million, up 20% versus prior year. The increase was due to targeted investments we made in expanding our distribution team, incremental advertising and higher stock-based compensation. In the quarter, GAAP operating income grew 8% to $63 million, translating to an operating margin of 26%. The variance versus prior year, again, was driven by growth investments and higher stock-based compensation. 
Net income for the quarter was $57 million or $1.24 per diluted share versus $0.70 in Q4 '20. Net income increased 79%, primarily due to the mark-to-market investment in Shockwave. Shockwave impacted our reported EPS by $0.13 in the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains robust. In Q4, we generated $86 million of operating cash flow and approximately $275 million for the year. As a result, we ended the fiscal year with $848 million in cash, up $197 million or 30% versus last year while remaining debt-free. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as with flexibility to make continued investments. 
Now turning to our full year performance. Throughout the fiscal year, we were agile within the COVID environment, navigating the challenges presented by it, but remain disciplined and executed on our goals. As a result, we saw quarterly improvement in both patients and revenue and delivered global revenue of $848 million, an increase of 1% versus prior year despite the global pandemic. By geography, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. declined 2%, while Europe and Japan grew 12% and 22%, respectively. GAAP operating income for the fiscal year '21 was $230 million, down 8% compared to the prior year, which equates to a 27.1% operating margin. 
We took a fiscally disciplined approach throughout the year. We control discretionary expenses and instituted temporary actions to reduce costs while investing at record levels and innovation. In fiscal year '21, we invested $122 million in R&D, up 23% year-over-year. Additionally, we added 40 heads to our distribution team within the year with the majority occurring in our fourth quarter. Net income for the year was $226 million or $4.94 per diluted share versus $203 million or $4.43 in the prior year. The 11% increase was primarily driven by our equity investment in Shockwave. 
Lastly, turning to our guidance for fiscal year '22. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.03 billion which translates to 17% to 22% growth for the year. At the low end, our guidance assumes some continued uncertainty with COVID, namely unevenness and recoveries caused by resurgences, national lockdowns, new strains, vaccine availability and adoption. At the high end of the range, our assumptions include vaccines are broadly distributed, leading to lower new COVID cases in a social and economic return to normalcy, which should have a positive effect on our customers and our business. As we typically do when issuing guidance, I would like to provide some color on our expectations to the seasonality of our fiscal year. 
In Q1, we anticipate that utilization will remain uneven as we continue to endure the different transition pace across geographies of resurgences, recovery and vaccinations globally. However, we remain confident in the efficacy of our playbook and execution and our ability to continue to treat patients in this environment and believe revenue in Q1 '22 will be flat to slightly above Q4 '21 revenue of $241 million. 
Historically, Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. We believe this could be exasperated this year given the potential vacations in pent-up demand for travel. So we expect Q2 revenue to be flat or slightly below the Q1 pace. As we transition to the back half of the year, we typically see sequential lift in Q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement, and in Q4, our March quarter, we expect to have our best results as we end our fiscal year. 
Turning to operating margin. We expect our fiscal year '22 margin to be in the range of 24% to 26% as we step up targeted investments in innovation, clinical evidence and distribution. A significant portion of our incremental investment will be in R&D as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies and further validate the safety and efficacy of Impella with multiple ongoing randomized controlled trials. We also plan to expand our distribution, accelerate marketing initiatives and grow our training and education programs. 
In summary, fiscal year '21 was a challenging, but very productive year for us as we endured the pandemic and transitioned to Abiomed 2.0. We are pleased to have delivered year-over-year top line growth, achieved GAAP operating margin of 27% and increased our cash to $848 million all while continuing to make necessary investments to drive Abiomed's long-term sustainable growth. We have come through an exceptionally challenging year. I am proud of our employees around the globe for their commitment and hard work. And for their accomplishments. I am very excited for the year ahead as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

So as it looks from an April perspective, we're not going to provide April actual performance at this point in time.

For clinical research, we're now taking all the studies and the leverage that we've done, and we posted a summary of the clinical studies on a slide in our -- on the website. But it's just we've learned now how to optimize high-risk PCI. We've learned how to optimize cardiogenic shock and we've learned how to optimize survival and return to baseline for acute on chronic heart shock. So these are the cardiomyopathy patients. And so those are the things we're working on. We think we're going to further our lead across the board. And of course, we're going to solidify our patent position as we go. So we're very excited because as I said in my prepared remarks, I do think we will have the path forward and create a new standard of care for high-risk PCI for STEMI, for cardiogenic shock and for heart failure overall. So we're excited to be where we are coming out of the year."

So it's innovation, it's clinical evidence and its distribution. So when you think about innovation, it's smaller, smarter, more connected devices, ECP, the expandable sheets, the AI algorithms think about the investments we're making in BTR, which again would open up another 100,000 patient population for us for heart failure and then continued investment in Breethe. When I look at clinical evidence, it's really STEMI PROTECT IV for the early feasibility study with ECP. I look at these as more digital events that require investment. They're not really long term investments in R&D. So I think over time, you'll see R&D as a percentage of sales will moderate as we execute on our trials. And then the third big bucket is around distribution. We are expanding our distribution team, Chris. We are -- we -- if you went back and looked at our performance over COVID, we noticed that the smaller regions tended to perform better than some of our larger regions. So we've made the decision to go from 17 regions in the United States to 23. We've started making that investment in Q4. You'll see a little bit more of that investment in Q1. So we are expanding our distribution team, putting more feet on the street and having more local leadership. We are expanding advertising on our direct-to-patient initiatives that Mike highlighted in his comments, again, targeting that 319,000 untreated population, utilizing PROTECT IV. And then we're going to be doing a little bit more trade shows and education. So I think some of it in R&D, and most of it in R&D is going to be, I would say, temporary over the next year or 2. It's a big investment year for us. With that said, at our operating margin guidance of 24% to 26%, midpoint of 25% is still pretty strong given the fact that we're driving 17% to 22% top line growth."

It's not as if we're not looking for heart disease in this country. So how realistic is it to really bring those patients into the fold, especially since penetration of Impella supported PCI within the diagnosed population is still relatively low today."

If you look at TAVR when they started, they went out and identified the patients that were surgical turndowns. They weren't considered for the cath lab because they didn't have the technology. The same is true with mitral as well as the WATCHMAN. When PROTECT II started, none of those patients went to the cath lab, and nearly all those patients had already been turned down for surgery, but not considered for high-risk PCI. The exciting thing about PROTECT IV and the engagement of the heart failure community and heart failure cardiology specifically, is they don't consider PCI in general practice. And what they really look at is optical medical management or the invasiveness of a surgery, which many of these patients are turned down. So moving forward, because they're involved in the design of PROTECT IV. And as 1 physician described it the other day in a broad presentation, he said that PROTECT IV is essentially a heart failure study. And what it does is it opens up another therapy for this growing population, these type 2 diabetes patients that have poor ejection fraction, they don't want or they're turned down for surgery. And you can see a benefit with protective PCI. What's unique about and what's new is that our protective PCI patients show an improvement in their quality of life and show an improvement in their ejection fraction in 90 days. And so that's what's unique. And now that we look at the historic trends, when people do show up in the hospitals, they usually, for these types of cases, they only look at it at the -- and try to look for Corners Zs around 17% of the time. And it's less than 5% of the time that people are actually getting revascularization in the index admission. So there's a lot of opportunity there. And it's not anyone's fault. It's just that the heart failure community has not been looking at or considering a protected PCI solution because in the past, PCI did not improve EF. That was only done with open heart surgery with CABG. Moving forward, that's something we've been able to show in multiple FDA studies, PROTECT II, PROTECT III and also in RESTORE EF. And that will be the gain. And I believe that's why ear -- the heart failure community overall will get engaged."

An",487,"Anthony, thanks for the question on CMS and the reimbursement, we agree with your comments. We're pleased, and we believe it now provides a permanent solution. What we've always talked about is that [indiscernible] is a platform with multiple patients. And so we position the products and the reimbursement even in the future, some of the pricing, you have a 4-hour pump or procedure, that's a high-risk PCI. You've got a 4-day patient, that's the cardio zinc shock patient in the ICU on Impella Connect with smart algorithms. And you've got this acute on chronic shock patient that's a 4-month -- up to a 4-month potential patient with the 5.5 and future BTR pump. 
So it definitely aligns completely what we're doing. So it allows for the differentiation for the type of resources and support that we provide. We do think it's a permanent -- more permanent solution. And it also really aligns with our hub-and-spoke strategy. As Todd mentioned, we saw that when COVID hit, we saw bigger growth in the small to mid-sized hospitals and regions. So we went a little bit leaner and a little bit faster by adding more regions and more team approaches. But we also saw in March a massive swing back in the large centers. And so part of that has to do with our hub-and-spoke coordination. Where if a patient ends up in any cath lab, we're going to know about it. We're going to be there to support, we'll be in the cloud watching. But then we can also help monitor and work together the top centers that do the most complex work with the spoke centers. And what CMS also did was slightly increase our DR268, which allows those outlying hospitals to place the Impella, stabilize the patient and then make the decision if they want to send them to the high end center. 
The last piece of this has to do with our distribution. We are going to maintain this distribution overall in all the cath labs but we do have a dedicated team now that's a heart recovery team that's working directly with the heart surgeons and the heart failure cardiologists. We think that will help with the referral network. But it will also allow us to go deeper to those transplant centers. There are about 140 of them that really do the most advanced work and those chronic patient care that we're excited now to bring 5.5 BTR. And RP did rebound owes well in this quarter. We're going to put SmartAssist on RP. So we'll now get some of the information on a biventricular patient that has never existed. We're going to make further improvements to the RP to ensure that the surgeons also have a way to utilize it. So lots of good things happening with CMS. We appreciate the work and the thoughtfulness that they put in to the final rule."

We have described in detail the study. Dr. Chuck Simonton did a webcast on it last year. So that's still up on our investor page, and we'll give more details. But to your specific question, on the design, think of it as an on pump PCI, which is the Impella supported PCI versus off pump PCI, which is where the majority of these patients today, they actually don't get a balloon pump. They get the in and out approach where the physician has to inflate the balloon and replace quickly or otherwise, the human collapse, or they stage the patient or they do a combination of things or they limit the contrast because they're worried about acute kidney injury. So there will be patients that they will have the option to use a balloon pump and now that they know that today. That's partly why they don't necessarily use it today because for many people it's not something that's going to provide hemonc support if the patient gets in trouble. And the majority of these patients today are in and out. But what PROTECT II showed and other studies with Impella showed is that these patients that when they get complete revascularization, with Impella support, we've been able to demonstrate significant improvements in the ejection fraction or the quality of life of these patients at 90 days. Most recently, that was presented in the RESTORE EF and with the PROTECT III study also showed is lower adverse events on bleeding. So we've made great progress on access closure. But we're also seeing that the physicians are doing a better job leaving less ischemia. And when they do that, that's where you really see the benefit for the patient. In the past, CABG did and does get an improvement in EF because what they're doing is taking a clean vein and rerouting the blood flow. So there's an improvement in EF. But there is a price to pay with the sternotomy and the pump run and the recovery for an open heart surgery. And so in the end, what we -- what we'll have here is a design study that will be able to track everything in terms of quality of life, heart failure, readmissions, improvement in EF. And it's really a comprehensive heart failure study designed by the trialists, and it will have an adaptive design. But we feel very comfortable that the physicians know the patients are out there, and they're excited to work with their referral network. And we're very excited that this is going to -- this is an on label study. So we're excited to get out there and start identifying these patients."

So on the COVID playbook, we're tracking weekly access to the hospital's ICU capacity Impella Connect. And then we do see a flip back and forth between the high-risk PCI patients and the shock patients. We know if shock or pulmonary embolism or Ecpella and those things go up. The ICUs fill up, that means that we're going to have a bit of a delay in high-risk PCI at the big centers, but that bolus will come back. The interesting element of that is our smaller and midsized territories and hospitals, they did not see that dip as much because they then potentially do that patient and they don't refer that patient to the larger center. 
If we track on shock and you look at the year, 6 out of the 12 months had positive growth. 8 of the 12 months had flat to positive. And 2 -- the first 2 months of COVID last April, May were down and they were down double digit. But after that, shock itself recovered, and that's kind of part of the playbook. And then in this hub and spoke, last piece of this, is, as we've mentioned, we set records in Q4. But in March, we set our records for most patients ever, most high-risk PCI patients ever and most cardiogenic shock patients ever. So we think the playbook works, and we like this hub-and-spoke network, and we like the changes we've made to the distribution to really capitalize on that opportunity."

But what are you seeing as far as utilization of the 2.5 sheet among centers that have access to it? And then what's the timing on CP? Is it still kind of expected here in a few months?

We do have it on the 2.5, and we did do cases in the U.S. last quarter. But the majority of our larger volume users are very comfortable with access closure today. PROTECT III showed we have low single-digit vascular complications and bleeding. We also showed that in the STEMI DTU FDA study the single access is now approved also in Europe and has been the means of choice by a lot of the physicians that do the most Impella's. And so they'd much prefer today to have the CP. They're comfortable with access closure and they like single access. So what we're doing with CP is you have the XR sheet, which is a 510(k), but we are also in coordination with that. We're making some minor adjustments to the product to augment that, but that will require a PMA submission supplement. So that's where we think we're going to have the 2 aligned by the end of this fiscal year.

You have the heart surgeons and then you have the interventional cardiologists. And they work together well in certain cases. They work together well in TAVR because they're all aligned in the hybrid lab. But there still is this inherent competition between high-risk PCI and CABG. And what we've shown is that the 2 work together, something we call high-risk revascularization. So as we identify these patients, some of these patients go for high-risk PCI, some of these patients go for high-risk CABG, where they utilize Impella and that was presented by Dr. Ed Solte from Cleveland Clinic on the approach that they use. And some of those CABG patients, they do have for kidney function and they need support coming off the heart lung machine. And this presentation is also still up. But what their protocol is, is if there's acute on chronic patient, they go to the Impella 5.5 as the primary driver. They no longer use the 5.0. And the 5.5 has the optical sensor, it gives us the ability to see what's happening and the pressure in the left ventricle, it's ideal for weaning. Then they establish that patient, then they decide is the revascularization going to be done in the cath lab by the intervention cardiologists, are they going to do it in the surgical suite with CABG, in certain cases, if they need a VT ablation, they'll take them to the EP lab, and they'll do a VT ablation but the Impella pump is stabilizing that acute on chronic patient. That's a different patient than an AMI shock patient, whose first symptom is the heart attack that leads to shock. That patient is still going quickly into the cath lab through the door to balloon time protocol, where they'll put the Impella in before they do the PCI. So the short answer is yes, because it's driving the science and the recognition of unloading, and it allows us to take patients and make sure that we maintain the ability to still provide a path of the least invasive, most cost-effective approach to not only keep the patient alive, but send them home with their own heart. And so we're really excited to see the leadership by Cleveland Clinic on surgery, Cedars out in La, the teams in Chicago, across the board, the 5.5 is really a revolutionary product for heart failure. And we've added some heart failure of people in the company and on the distribution. So we really are changing heart failure now to heart recovery, and it's a different mindset, but it's what 5.5 enables. And what Impella BTR will continue because now we'll have the ability to send the patient home and have a pump that runs even longer without a purge."

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Abiomed has remained on course to advance our innovation and become the standard of care for circulatory support. We adapted and executed while successfully transitioning from our red, yellow and green phases to Abiomed 2.0. The 2.0 marks our transformation into a smarter and more connected online medical device company with a COVID playbook. We conduct on-site and online training and education and provide patients support with smart algorithms to track real-world utilization in the cloud, identify best practices and optimize patient care.
For the quarter, Abiomed delivered a company record of $241 million in revenue, up 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth and record revenue across the U.S., Europe and Japan. Within the quarter, we saw monthly sequential improvement in both global revenue and patient utilization. Q4 investments continued while achieving a 26% GAAP operating margin. Applying our Abiomed 2.0 COVID playbook, we definitively transitioned to the green phase validated with record number of patients supported in a quarter, in a month, in a week and in a day, all in Q4.  
Turning to the full fiscal year. Abiomed delivered $848 million in revenue, up 1% year-over-year and 27% operating margin despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We took a disciplined approach to the fiscal year to help us navigate the uncertain environment and achieve our tactical plan. Over the past year, we endured the setbacks of COVID-19 and focused on keeping employees safe, making lifesaving heart pumps and supporting our hospitals and patients. We controlled expenses and invested in innovation, new clinical studies and expanded distribution, while remaining fiscally responsible.  
Our balance sheet strengthened to $848 million in cash, while maintaining 0 debt and acquiring an ECMO platform. In addition, our IP portfolio increased to 1,150 Impella patents and 940 patents pending. We achieved a significant number of regulatory approvals and established world-class online training and education with CAMP PCI. At Abiomed, our Patients First mindset gives us purpose and courage, and we always seek opportunities to lead, manage, adapt and execute. For this fiscal year, I would like to thank our employees and customers for their courage, dedication to patients and leadership throughout the pandemic. 
We exited the year slightly up in revenue, profitable and stronger than ever before. For today's call, I will highlight our fiscal '21 innovation that will drive our success and momentum into our fiscal year '22 goals and beyond. In fiscal year '21, Abiomed launched revolutionary innovation across multiple patient populations, starting with the accelerated rollout of Impella Connect, our remote monitoring capability, allowing us to go live at nearly 1,000 hospitals in the U.S. Currently, 70% of our patients are monitored in the cloud with Impella Connect. No other company in our space provides this level of 24/7 on site, on call and online support. This is particularly meaningful in the COVID environment. We have also expanded our global footprint with Impella Connect at 29 hospitals in Germany and 49 hospitals in Japan.  
Next, the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to deliver strong results. Within the quarter, our U.S. surgical revenue grew 46% year-over-year as we expanded this device to 53 more sites totaling 211 sites. For the full fiscal year, U.S. surgical revenue grew 44% year-over-year, driven by strength in patient utilization. The Impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product because it is minimally invasive, provides forward flow and is a fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons. 
It is inserted via the axillary artery or directly into the aorta and designed for longer duration support with patient ambulations. The Impella 5.5 has reported comparatively higher survival rates and native heart recovery for the acutely decompensating heart failure patient population, representing an additional 100,000 treatable U.S. patients. Heart surgeons are also enthusiastic about our BTR heart pump first-in-human experience expected in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.  
Turning to our Abiomed Breethe Oxy-1 System, we have now treated 20 patients to date at several sites. In March, I visited our Breethe facility in Baltimore, and met a Breethe ECMO patient on support at the nearby University of Maryland Medical Center. The feedback from physicians on this innovative, compact cardiopulmonary bypass system has been positive. Customers highlight the ease of use with the simple intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for ambulation. We will continue to innovate and plan to optimize this technology with Smart ECPELLA software and connected cloud monitoring.  
Moving on to our regulatory progress. We advanced our U.S. FDA early feasibility study for the Impella ECP, a true 9 French heart pump. As a reminder, in early Q4, we received FDA approval for the expansion of the early feasibility study to 20 patients and have enrolled 10 patients to date. The excitement for PROTECT IV is palpable in the heart failure community, and we recently announced our first patient enrolled at Ascension St. John Hospital in Detroit. It is important to note that PROTECT IV was designed by the leaders and best clinical trialists in the field of cardiovascular medicine. 
It is an on label prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that is designed to provide the level of clinical evidence needed to achieve a global Class I guideline recommendation for Impella in high-risk PCI in the future. The intent of PROTECT IV RCT is to leverage and validate the best practices that we have learned over the past 10 years in the PROTECT series and cVAD studies that led to the exclusive FDA PMA approval of Impella for high-risk PCI. We believe the heart failure communities engagement will propel the PROTECT IV study to be a landmark trial for high-risk PCI overall as a new treatment alternative. 
In the past, we have defined our current addressable market for high-risk PCI as 121,000 U.S. patients. As a result of the PROTECT IV study, we are directly investing this year in outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the undertreated population of an additional 319,000 high-risk PCI patients that are turned down for surgery and not referred for Protected PCI treatment due to not being diagnosed or tested for coronary artery disease. Since the PROTECT IV study is on label and spans the heart team, we now estimate our new U.S. addressable patient population for high-risk PCI to be 440,000 patients.  
For context, 15 million people in the U.S. have coronary artery disease and heart failure, and it causes approximately 1 million deaths per year. Coronary artery disease and heart failure remains the leading cause of death overall and is the #1 cause of death for people with type 2 diabetes. While we will not complete this study in fiscal year '22,  we now have line of sight and a path forward to solidify the new standard of care for high-risk PCI with the goal of complete revascularization and improvement in patient quality of life and ejection fraction.  
Finally, I want to highlight some of our goals for Abiomed 2.0 fiscal '22 and beyond with investments focused on extending our lead in innovation, advancing Impella clinical evidence and establishing commercial excellence with a premier distribution team. First, we will continue to invest in R&D as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies that are smaller, smarter and connected to improve ease of use and clinical outcomes. Second, we plan to execute multiple RCTs, including STEMI DTU, PROTECT IV and advance the RECOVER IV cardiogenic shock design with the goal of achieving Class I guidelines overall. 
In addition, we expect to further validate the safety and efficacy of Impella and the importance of complete revascularization in high-risk PCI with the publications of PROTECT III and RESTORE EF. For cardiogenic shock, positive clinical results presented yesterday at the SCAI Scientific Sessions for the physician-initiated National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative will be published. Separately, the positive results presented by the MHLW, PVAD, Japanese Heart Committee will also be published. 
Because these cardiogenic shock patients are difficult to randomize and consent, our best practice protocols are derived from over 10 years of real-world evidence and over 100,000 patients with physician-initiated and prospective FDA and PMDA studies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. This new paradigm focuses on improved survival and native heart recovery. And finally, through a combination of our U.S. distribution expansion and leveraging CAMP PCI, we plan to deliver best-in-class training and education on-site and online with the goal of identifying patients, improving outcomes and driving Impella adoption.  
Before I conclude, I want to share a patient story. Chris Kirkman, a 48-year-old husband, father and sales director from Zachary, Louisiana has a family history of heart disease and has lived with hypertension for 20 years. In December 2020, after experiencing shortness of breath, fluid buildup around his abdomen and difficulty sleeping, Chris visited a local emergency clinic. He was prescribed medication and sent home. Chris' symptoms gradually became more severe over the next few months. When he experienced trouble breathing, Chris' wife drove him to the local hospital where he was diagnosed with advanced coronary disease and congestive heart failure with poor ejection fraction at 20%. 
He was told he was too high-risk for bypass surgery and discharged home with a wearable defibrillator. Chris was then referred to interventional cardiologist, Dr. Abraham, at Baton Rouge General - Bluebonnet. Dr. Abraham identified Chris as an appropriate candidate for Protected PCI with Impella. When he returned for the scheduled procedure, Dr. Abraham successfully achieved complete revascularization with the help of Impella CP heart pump, and Chris was discharged home the next day. During his follow-up exam, Chris' ejection fraction improved to 45%. Today, Chris is thankful to be back at work and enjoying a healthier lifestyle with his wife and 3 children.  
In conclusion, I'm very proud of our employees and customers for their dedication and courage during the COVID pandemic. Despite the challenging circumstances on both professional and personal levels, Abiomed 2.0 delivered 1 of our most productive fiscal years in my 17-year tenure as CEO. I am confident that Abiomed will not just be a successful company, but will drive a new standard of care for multiple growing populations of high-risk heart failure patients around the world. We look to the new fiscal year with great excitement because we are a stronger company today and have a clear path for execution to fulfill our heart recovery mission. And last, we sincerely appreciate the continued support from our patients, customers and shareholders.  
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

We leveraged our Abiom",1328,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Now starting with Q4 results. As Mike mentioned, we delivered record revenue of $241 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the U.S., Europe and Japan. We leveraged our Abiomed 2.0 COVID playbook, which allowed us to transition to the green phase, where we grew patients and revenue year-over-year and delivered on our innovation, regulatory and clinical milestones despite the current environment.  
Turning to our regional performance. U.S. revenue grew 13% to $196 million, driven by a 13% increase in patient utilization. We saw double-digit growth in both high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock. The pandemic hit peak levels in the first few weeks of January, which impacted patient utilization. However, as COVID cases and related hospitalizations began to decline and we executed our playbook, we delivered sequential improvements in patients and revenue in each month of the quarter. We also set a patient and revenue record in March.  
At the end of our fiscal Q4 in the U.S., the CP is now in 1,509 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 663 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 211 sites, up 53 sites versus prior quarter. Lastly, the Impella RP is now in 588 sites, up 19 versus Q3. U.S. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly below 100% and average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was 4.7 units per site, consistent with the inventory levels we saw in Q3.  
Turning to outside the U.S. In Q4, total revenue was $46 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strength in Europe and Japan. Our European revenue increased 28% year-over-year due to higher patient utilization in several markets, such as Germany, Austria and the U.K. and a benefit from the euro-U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. Similar to the U.S., in Europe, we saw an impact in January, when certain countries mandated lockdowns as COVID cases and deaths accelerated. However, here too, we leveraged the COVID playbook, executed on our plan and delivered monthly sequential improvement throughout the quarter.  
Japan continues to perform very well, delivering $11.6 million in revenue, up 38% year-over-year, driven by patient utilization. We opened 10 new sites in the quarter, bringing our total to 166 sites. Moving forward, gross margin for Q4 was 80.9%, flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from increased production volume, offsetting higher material spend and stock-based compensation. R&D expense totaled $32 million, an increase of 26% from the prior year. The value of our ongoing innovation has been evident throughout the past year, and we believe it will continue to create value as we invest in advancing the Impella ECP, XR Sheath, Breethe Oxy-1 System and Impella BTR and in clinical evidence with PROTECT IV, STEMI DTU and DanGer.  
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $100 million, up 20% versus prior year. The increase was due to targeted investments we made in expanding our distribution team, incremental advertising and higher stock-based compensation. In the quarter, GAAP operating income grew 8% to $63 million, translating to an operating margin of 26%. The variance versus prior year, again, was driven by growth investments and higher stock-based compensation. Net income for the quarter was $57 million or $1.24 per diluted share versus $0.70 in Q4 '20. 
Net income increased 79%, primarily due to the mark-to-market investment in Shockwave. Shockwave impacted our reported EPS by $0.13 in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains robust. In Q4, we generated $86 million of operating cash flow and approximately $275 million for the year. As a result, we ended the fiscal year with $848 million in cash, up $197 million or 30% versus last year, while remaining debt-free. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as with flexibility to make continued investments.  
Now turning to our full year performance. Throughout the fiscal year, we were agile within the COVID environment, navigating the challenges presented by it, but remain disciplined and executed on our goals. As a result, we saw quarterly improvement in both patients and revenue and delivered global revenue of $848 million, an increase of 1% versus prior year despite the global pandemic. By geography, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. declined 2%, while Europe and Japan grew 12% and 22%, respectively. GAAP operating income for the fiscal year '21 was $230 million, down 8% compared to the prior year, which equates to a 27.1% operating margin.  
We took a fiscally disciplined approach throughout the year. We controlled discretionary expenses and instituted temporary actions to reduce costs, while investing at record levels in innovation. In fiscal year '21, we invested $122 million in R&D, up 23% year-over-year. Additionally, we added 40 heads to our distribution team within the year with the majority occurring in our fourth quarter. Net income for the year was $226 million or $4.94 per diluted share versus $203 million or $4.43 in the prior year. The 11% increase was primarily driven by our equity investment in Shockwave.  
Lastly, turning to our guidance for fiscal year '22. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.03 billion which translates to 17% to 22% growth for the year. At the low end, our guidance assumes some continued uncertainty with COVID, namely unevenness and recoveries caused by resurgences, national lockdowns, new strains, vaccine availability and adoption. At the high end of the range, our assumptions include vaccines are broadly distributed, leading to lower new COVID cases in a social and economic return to normalcy, which should have a positive effect on our customers and our business. 
As we typically do when issuing guidance, I would like to provide some color on our expectations to the seasonality of our fiscal year. In Q1, we anticipate that utilization will remain uneven as we continue to endure the different transition pace across geographies of resurgences, recovery and vaccinations globally. However, we remain confident in the efficacy of our playbook and execution and our ability to continue to treat patients in this environment and believe revenue in Q1 '22 will be flat to slightly above Q4 '21 revenue of $241 million.  
Historically, Q2 is a seasonally slow quarter for cardiovascular devices due to the summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. We believe this could be exasperated this year given the potential vacations and pent-up demand for travel. So we expect Q2 revenue to be flat or slightly below the Q1 pace. As we transition to the back half of the year, we typically see sequential lift in Q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. And in Q4, our March quarter, we expect to have our best results as we end our fiscal year.  
Turning to operating margin. We expect our fiscal year '22 margin to be in the range of 24% to 26% as we step up targeted investments in innovation, clinical evidence and distribution. A significant portion of our incremental investment will be in R&D as we innovate best-in-class heart and lung support technologies and further validate the safety and efficacy of Impella with multiple ongoing randomized controlled trials. We also plan to expand our distribution, accelerate marketing initiatives and grow our training and education programs.  
In summary, fiscal year '21 was a challenging, but very productive year for us as we endured the pandemic and transitioned to Abiomed 2.0. We are pleased to have delivered year-over-year top line growth, achieved GAAP operating margin of 27% and increased our cash to $848 million all while continuing to make necessary investments to drive Abiomed's long-term sustainable growth. We have come through an exceptionally challenging year. I am proud of our employees around the globe for their commitment and hard work and for their accomplishments. I am very excited for the year ahead as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

So it's innovation, it's clinical evidence and it's distribution. So when you think about innovation, it's smaller, smarter, more connected devices, ECP, the expandable sheaths, the AI algorithms, think about the investments we're making in BTR, which again would open up another 100,000 patient population for us for heart failure and then continued investment in Breethe. 
When I look at clinical evidence, it's really STEMI, PROTECT IV, the early feasibility study with ECP. I look at these as more digital events that require investment. They're not really long term investments in R&D. So I think over time, you'll see R&D as a percentage of sales will moderate as we execute on our trials. And then the third big bucket is around distribution. We are expanding our distribution team, Chris. We are -- we -- if you went back and looked at our performance over COVID, we noticed that the smaller regions tended to perform better than some of our larger regions. So we've made the decision to go from 17 regions in the United States to 23. 
We've started making that investment in Q4. You'll see a little bit more of that investment in Q1. So we are expanding our distribution team, putting more feet on the street and having more local leadership. We are expanding advertising on our direct-to-patient initiatives that Mike highlighted in his comments, again, targeting that 319,000 untreated population, utilizing PROTECT IV. And then we're going to be doing a little bit more trade shows and education. So I think some of it in R&D and most of it in R&D is going to be, I would say, temporary over the next year or 2. It's a big investment year for us. With that said, at our operating margin guidance of 24% to 26%, midpoint of 25%, is still pretty strong given the fact that we're driving 17% to 22% top line growth."

It's not as if we're not looking for heart disease in this country. So how realistic is it to really bring those patients into the fold, especially since penetration of Impella supported PCI within the diagnosed population is still relatively low today?"

If you look at TAVR, when they started, they went out and identified the patients that were surgical turndowns. They weren't considered for the cath lab because they didn't have the technology. The same is true with mitral as well as the WATCHMAN. When PROTECT II started, none of those patients went to the cath lab, and nearly all those patients had already been turned down for surgery, but not considered for high-risk PCI. The exciting thing about PROTECT IV and the engagement of the heart failure community and heart failure cardiology specifically is they don't consider PCI in general practice. And what they really look at is optical medical management or the invasiveness of a surgery, which many of these patients are turned down. 
So moving forward, because they're involved in the design of PROTECT IV -- and as 1 physician described it the other day in a broad presentation. He said that PROTECT IV is essentially a heart failure study. And what it does is it opens up another therapy for this growing population, these type 2 diabetes patients, that have poor ejection fraction. They don't want or they're turned down for surgery. And you can see a benefit with Protected PCI. What's unique about and what's new is that our Protected PCI patients show an improvement in their quality of life and show an improvement in their ejection fraction in 90 days. And so that's what's unique. 
And now that we look at the historic trends, when people do show up in the hospitals, they usually -- for these types of cases, they only look at it -- at the -- and try to look for coronary disease around 17% of the time. And it's less than 5% of the time that people are actually getting revascularization in the index admission. So there's a lot of opportunity there. And it's not anyone's fault. It's just that the heart failure community has not been looking at or considering a Protected PCI solution because in the past, PCI did not improve EF. That was only done with open heart surgery, with CABG. Moving forward, that's something we've been able to show in multiple FDA studies, PROTECT II, PROTECT III and also in RESTORE EF. And that will be the gain. And I believe that's why heart failure -- the heart failure community overall will get engaged."

And so we",490,"Anthony, thanks for the question on CMS and the reimbursement. We agree with your comments. We're pleased, and we believe it now provides a permanent solution. What we've always talked about is that Impella is a platform with multiple patients. And so we position the products and the reimbursement and even in the future some of the pricing. You have a 4-hour pump or procedure. That's a high-risk PCI. You've got a 4-day patient. That's the cardiogenic shock patient in the ICU on Impella Connect with smart algorithms. And you've got this acute on chronic shock patient, that's a 4-month -- up to a 4-month potential patient with the 5.5 and future BTR pump. So it definitely aligns completely what we're doing. So it allows for the differentiation for the type of resources and support that we provide. 
We do think it's a permanent -- more permanent solution. And it also really aligns with our hub-and-spoke strategy. As Todd mentioned, we saw that -- when COVID hit, we saw bigger growth in the small to mid-sized hospitals and regions. So we went a little bit leaner and a little bit faster by adding more regions and more team approaches. But we also saw in March a massive swing back in the large centers. And so part of that has to do with our hub-and-spoke coordination. Where if a patient ends up in any cath lab, we're going to know about it. We're going to be there to support. We'll be in the cloud watching. But then we can also help monitor and work together the top centers that do the most complex work with the spoke centers. And what CMS also did was slightly increase our DRG 268, which allows those outlying hospitals to place the Impella, stabilize the patient and then make the decision if they want to send them to the high end center. 
The last piece of this has to do with our distribution. We are going to maintain this distribution overall in all the cath labs but we do have a dedicated team now that's a heart recovery team that's working directly with the heart surgeons and the heart failure cardiologists. We think that will help with the referral network. But it will also allow us to go deeper to those transplant centers. There are about 140 of them that really do the most advanced work and those chronic patient care that we're excited now to bring 5.5 BTR. And RP did rebound also well in this quarter. We're going to put SmartAssist on RP. So we'll now get some of the information on a biventricular patient that has never existed, and we're going to make further improvements to the RP to ensure that the surgeons also have a way to utilize it. So lots of good things happening with CMS. We appreciate the work and the thoughtfulness that they put in to the final rule."

We have described in detail the study. Dr. Chuck Simonton did a webcast on it last year. So that's still up on our Investor page, and we'll give more details. But to your specific question, on the design, think of it as an on-pump PCI, which is the Impella supported PCI versus off-pump PCI, which is where the majority of these patients today -- they actually don't get a balloon pump. They get the in and out approach where the physician has to inflate the balloon and replace stent quickly or otherwise the hemodynamics will collapse, or they stage the patient or they do a combination of things or they limit the contrast because they're worried about acute kidney injury. 
So there will be patients that they will have the option to use a balloon pump and they know that today. That's partly why they don't necessarily use it today because for many people it's not something that's going to provide hemodynamic support if the patient gets in trouble. And the majority of these patients today are in and out. What PROTECT II showed and other studies with Impella showed is that these patients that when they get complete revascularization, with Impella support, we've been able to demonstrate significant improvements in the ejection fraction or the quality of life of these patients at 90 days. 
Most recently, that was presented in the RESTORE EF and with the PROTECT III study also showed is lower adverse events on bleeding. So we've made great progress on access closure. But we're also seeing that the physicians are doing a better job leaving less ischemia. And when they do that, that's where you really see the benefit for the patient. In the past, CABG did and does get an improvement in EF because what they're doing is taking a clean vein and rerouting the blood flow. So there's an improvement in EF. But there is a price to pay with the sternotomy and the pump run and the recovery for an open heart surgery. 
And so in the end, what we -- what we'll have here is a design study that will be able to track everything in terms of quality of life, heart failure, readmissions, improvement in EF. And it's really a comprehensive heart failure study designed by the trialists, and it will have an adaptive design. But we feel very comfortable that the physicians know the patients are out there, and they're excited to work with their referral network. And we're very excited that this is going to -- this is an on label study. So we're excited to get out there and start identifying these patients."

Just when you think about the expansions here in the United States from 17 to 23 regions, conceptually it makes sense. You're closer to the customer, more frequent visits. They're helping drive greater growth in those territories. Curious though, are you seeing similar types of trends in both high-risk PCI and the shock patient populations? And also just as we see more patients on Impella Connect, help us kind of understand what this -- how the distribution is really doing out there in the field? Just kind of want to get a better feel for what kind of lift you are seeing as you expand from 17 to 23."

So on the COVID playbook, we're tracking weekly access to the hospital's ICU capacity, Impella Connect. And then we do see a flip back and forth between the high-risk PCI patients and the shock patients. We know if shock or pulmonary embolism or ECPELLA and those things go up, the ICUs fill up. That means that we're going to have a bit of a delay in high-risk PCI at the big centers, but that bolus will come back. The interesting element of that is our smaller and midsized territories and hospitals. They did not see that dip as much because they then potentially do that patient and they don't refer that patient to the larger center. 
If we track on shock and you look at the year, 6 out of the 12 months had positive growth. 8 of the 12 months had flat to positive. And 2 -- the first 2 months of COVID last April, May were down and they were down double digit. But after that, shock itself recovered, and that's kind of part of the playbook. And then in this hub and spoke, last piece of this, is, as we've mentioned, we set records in Q4. But in March, we set our records for most patients ever, most high-risk PCI patients ever and most cardiogenic shock patients ever. So we think the playbook works, and we like this hub-and-spoke network, and we like the changes we've made to the distribution to really capitalize on that opportunity."

One of them is clearly helping the business versus just the guidance, which is good to see getting back up to low double digits here, which I think is kind of what you're targeting for the business going forward or maybe a little bit faster. But for starters on the sheath side of things and I know this is kind of getting down to the weeds a little bit, Mike or Todd. But what are you seeing as far as utilization of the 2.5 sheaths among centers that have access to it? And then what's the timing on CP? Is it still kind of expected here in a few months? Because what I'm really trying to get at is, is this starting to accelerate some adoption of Impella because of access of the sheath and then CP can hopefully help accelerate things a little bit more?"

We do have it on the 2.5, and we did do cases in the U.S. last quarter. But the majority of our larger volume users are very comfortable with access closure today. PROTECT III showed we have low single-digit vascular complications and bleeding. We also showed that in the STEMI DTU FDA study. The single access is now approved also in Europe and has been the means of choice by a lot of the physicians that do the most Impellas. And so they'd much prefer today to have the CP. 
They're comfortable with access closure and they like single access. So what we're doing with CP is you have the XR Sheath, which is a 510(k), but we are also in coordination with that. We're making some minor adjustments to the product to augment that, but that will require a PMA submission supplement. So that's where we think we're going to have the 2 aligned by the end of this fiscal year. But we're also pretty confident that part of the momentum we're seeing is just that the new techniques, the new clinical data and the single access really are the preference of our top centers."

But are you seeing some of the sites that were 5.5 as available, more clinicians coming over and starting to use Abiomed for other procedures, now that they can see 5.5, see how well it works and how unique it is? And then saying, okay, maybe I can use CP in some other patients as well. So are we getting any signs of kind of some growing momentum because of 5.5 throughout an entire center?"

You have the heart surgeons and then you have the interventional cardiologists. And they work together well in certain cases.

You have the heart surgeons and then you have the interventional cardiologists. And they work together well in certain cases. They work together well in TAVR because they're all aligned in the hybrid lab. But there's still this inherent competition between high-risk PCI and CABG. And what we've shown is that the 2 work together, something we call high-risk revascularization. So as we identify these patients, some of these patients go for high-risk PCI, some of these patients go for high-risk CABG, where they utilize Impella and that was presented by Dr. Ed Soltesz from Cleveland Clinic on the approach that they use. And some of those CABG patients, they do have for kidney function and they need support coming off the heart lung machine. 
And this presentation is also still up. But what their protocol is, is if there's acute on chronic patient, they go to the Impella 5.5 as the primary driver. They no longer use the 5.0. And the 5.5 has the optical sensor. It gives us the ability to see what's happening and the pressure in the left ventricle. It's ideal for weaning. Then they establish that patient, then they decide is the revascularization going to be done in the cath lab, by the intervention cardiologists, are they going to do it in the surgical suite with CABG. In certain cases, if they need a VT ablation, they'll take them to the EP lab, and they'll do a VT ablation but the Impella pump is stabilizing that acute on chronic patient. 
That's a different patient than an AMI shock patient, whose first symptom is the heart attack that leads to shock. That patient is still going quickly into the cath lab through the door to balloon time protocol, where they'll put the Impella in before they do the PCI. So the short answer is yes, because it's driving the science and the recognition of unloading. And it allows us to take patients and make sure that we maintain the ability to still provide a path of the least invasive, most cost-effective approach to not only keep the patient alive, but send them home with their own heart. 
And so we're really excited to see the leadership by Cleveland Clinic on surgery, Cedars out in LA, the teams in Chicago, across the board. The 5.5 is really a revolutionary product for heart failure. And we've added some heart failure people in the company and on the distribution. So we really are changing heart failure now to heart recovery, and it's a different mindset, but it's what 5.5 enables and what Impella BTR will continue because now we'll have the ability to send the patient home and have a pump that runs even longer without a purge."

Abiomed reported a strong start to our fiscal year '22 with global record revenue and record patient utilization in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In Q1, we delivered revenue of $253 million, up 53% versus prior year and up 5% versus prior quarter. Within the quarter, we achieved a 26.2% non-GAAP operating margin while continuing to invest with a focus on extending our lead in innovation, advancing clinical evidence and building a premier commercial team. 
Our balance sheet remains robust with $805 million in cash and 0 debt, while acquiring preCARDIA, a heart failure company. We grew our IP portfolio to 1,216 Impella patents and over 1,000 patents pending. We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and Abiomed 2.0 continues to drive our success. 
I am proud of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives. On today's call, I will highlight progress on our product innovation milestones for Impella 5.5 and RP, the regulatory status for Impella ECP and briefly discuss our strategy to be the leading company for all cardiologists and heart surgeons at every heart hospital, which means they have a cath lab and a surgical suite. 
Beginning with innovation, the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform very well. In the quarter, our U.S. surgical revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 17% versus prior quarter as we expanded this life-saving device to 46 more sites or 257 sites out of the 1,113 heart hospitals in total. Impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product. It does not require a sternotomy or coring of the left ventricle, and it is a forward flow, fully unloading weanable heart pump designed for hard surgeons to implant in less than 60 minutes via the axillary artery in the shoulder. 
The minimally invasive implant also allows for early ambulation for the patient which correlates to faster recovery and better outcomes. The longer usage time for the Impella 5.5 allows the SmartAssist software to track aortic pressure, left ventricular pressure, make predictive analysis on volume and right heart stability and communicate in the cloud with Impella Connect. 
We look forward to continuing to roll this device out to the remaining 856 heart hospitals in the U.S. and many more outside the U.S. We also received FDA premarket approval for the Impella RP with SmartAssist as safe and effective to treat acute right heart failure. This smart pump is the next generation of right heart support and already has exclusive weaning capability and FDA approval for right heart failure with multiple FDA studies and a recent emergency use authorization for COVID patients with pulmonary embolism. 
It is the first single venous access percutaneous heart pump with a sensor for the right ventricle. This sensor technology provides real-time guidance and trends that help with pump management and weaning. Much of this groundbreaking information on the right ventricle will be published and will elucidate the field of right heart failure. The Impella CP, Impella 5.5 and Impella RP now all utilize smart assist software, enhanced with Impella Connect to enable remote monitoring from any Internet-connected device through a secure HIPAA-compliant website. 
The Impella Connect software is now live at more than 80% of our U.S. sites and approximately 80% of our U.S. patients on support are monitored in the cloud. No other company in this space offers this capability or 24/7 service to the hospital, which is ideal with COVID. We also continued to accelerate the rollout of Impella Connect in Germany and Japan. 
Next, we remain ahead of schedule on our Impella ECP early feasibility study, EFS. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and measures 9 French in diameter, easing insertion and removal from the body. This allows for a smaller access site optimal for Protected PCI, which we believe will continue to drive better outcomes and overall utilization. 
To date, we have achieved our initial FDA study milestones enrolled 25 patients and submitted additional clinical data to the FDA for review. We plan to expand this breakthrough technology to new sites with product enhancements already implemented in the EFS process to up to 50 patients. 
In parallel, based on our interaction with the FDA, we have started to prepare the details of the single-arm pivotal Impella ECP high-risk PCI study. Next quarter, we expect to confirm our IDE protocol and submit for approval with the goal to enroll our first pivotal patient for high-risk PCI by the end of our fiscal year. 
We want to complement the FDA for this EFS program overall, which allows for faster innovation, real-time safety feedback and accelerated access to new technology for U.S. patients. Finally, our strategy to become the leading player for the heart team, which includes interventional cardiologists, heart failure cardiologists, intensivists and heart surgeons grows stronger. Our breakthrough platform now includes the Impella portfolio, ECMO with Breethe, ECPELLA and recently acquired PreCARDIA. preCARDIA was designated by the FDA as a breakthrough technology and will complement our existing product portfolio, increased options for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure called AD HF and expand our relationship with heart failure specialists managing the ICU. 
Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years of age, and we believe this device has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for the treatment of millions of patients in early-stage AD HF, a new patient population for Abiomed. This strategic acquisition in combination with our continued Impella 5.5 success and our future Impella BTR pump marks our movement towards minimally invasive devices for the heart failure community including our hub and spoke hospital network in every region of the country. 
To further enhance these clinical efforts, we continue to invest in commercial excellence with a focus on the broader heart failure community and the referral network. Specifically, we began our direct outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the undertreated high-risk PCI patient population of 440,000 U.S. patients. We continue to deliver best-in-class training and education by leveraging CAMP PCI and transition to both virtual and on-site settings. 
We have seen physician traction on our educational platform through events such as live cases and advisory boards and are excited to expand CAMP PCI internationally, as well as at CAMP heart failure and CAMP heart surgery this fiscal year. Before I conclude, I would like to share an inspiring patient story. John Fisher, 77, is a husband, grandfather and retired law enforcement officer from Ashland, Ohio. John has been experienced chest pain for more than a year, had been -- when the chest pain became more severe following his recovery from COVID-19, he decided to seek treatment. 
After an evaluation, John was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and evaluated for coronary artery bypass surgery called CABG surgery. Due to a low ejection fraction of 15% and multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, John was turned down for surgery, interventional cardiologists, Dr. Touch Mature determined John was a candidate for Protected PCI with Impella Dr. Mature inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist while he performed a complete revascularization. John returned home 6 days later. 
Today, his heart function is normal with a current EF of 55%, and he enjoys walking his dogs, woodworking and spending time with his grandson, who happens to work at Abiomed in headquarters. In closing, we will continue to create and deliver value by successfully advancing our innovation, clinical research and commercial distribution. We remain steadfast to our mission of creating the field of heart recovery and driving a new standard of care for multiple growing patient populations around the world. 
Q1 was a solid start and we believe we are well positioned for success in fiscal year '22. I would like to thank our employees and customers for their dedication to the mission of recovering hearts and saving lives and we appreciate the ongoing support of our shareholders. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting",987,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting with the U.S. Total U.S. revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $207 million. This growth was driven by a 43% increase in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a higher reorder rate. 
We are encouraged by the continued recovery from COVID within the quarter as we continue to see patients working their way back into the system. At the end of our fiscal Q1 in the U.S., the CP is in now 1,528 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 665 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 257 sites, up 46 sites versus prior quarter. 
Lastly, the Impella RP is in 609 sites, up 21 sites versus Q4. Our U.S. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly above 100%. And average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was 4.7 units per site. This is consistent with the inventory levels of the prior 2 quarters. Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $45 million, up 51% versus prior year. European revenue increased 64% year-over-year due to a strong recovery in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a benefit from the foreign exchange rate. 
Our Japan business delivered $11.3 million in revenue, up 26% year-over-year due to a 78% growth in patient utilization offsetting lower site openings. In the quarter, we opened 5 new sites, bringing our total sites to 171. This compares to the 10 site openings last quarter, and 13 site openings in Q1 of '21. We have seen some impact due to hospital restrictions related to COVID-19 and the Summer Olympics, which limits our ability to train new sites. 
But this is more timing as our backlog for new sites in Japan remains robust, and we expect to open more sites in the second half of the year as vaccination rates increase and hospital restrictions ease. Gross margin in Q1 was 82.1% compared to 78.2% in the same period of the prior year. The 390 basis point increase was primarily driven by higher volume and favorable sales mix. 
Our Q1 GAAP financial results for the quarter are summarized in our press release and earnings deck. For the remainder of the call, I'm going to provide the highlights of our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis in order to give greater transparency on the impact from the preCARDIA acquisition and to be consistent with our peers. A full reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results are summarized in our press release and earnings deck and are available on the Investors section of abiomed.com. 
R&D expense for the first quarter totaled $38 million, a 43% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by clinical costs for PROTECT IV and STEMI DTU randomized controlled trials as well as our investments in new products such as ECP and BTR. We believe that clinical evidence and innovation of smaller, smarter, more connected devices will drive sustainable long-term growth. 
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $103 million, an increase of $35 million or 51% versus prior year. The year-over-year increase is driven by headcount additions to our distribution team, our direct-to-patient initiative, higher spend on training and education, in COVID-related onetime cost actions from the prior year. 
Non-GAAP operating income grew 94% to $66 million in the quarter which translated to non-GAAP operating margin of 26.2%. Our margin expansion of 550 basis points was primarily due to higher volume which more than offset our growth enhancing investments. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $51 million or $1.10 per share, up 95% versus Q1 of '21. Our year-over-year performance was driven by higher volume and a lower effective tax rate. 
Our balance sheet remains debt-free. And we ended the quarter with $805 million of cash and marketable securities after funding our strategic investment to acquire the remaining shares of preCARDIA. In terms of full year guidance, keep in mind that our fiscal year experiences seasonality. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for all cardiovascular devices due to summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. In this summer, we believe it is being even more exasperated based on the pent-up vacation demand from COVID last year. 
With that said, we expect Q2 revenue to be in line or slightly down from our Q1 record revenue performance of $253 million in our summer quarter. As we transition to the back half of the year, we typically expect to see sequential lift in Q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. And as we finish the fiscal year in Q4, our March quarter, we expect to deliver our best results. 
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in our outlook, we are now raising our full year revenue guidance and expect it to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion up 22% to 24% for the year. This is an increase from our original guidance range of $990 million to $1.03 billion up 17% to 22% for the year. The low end of our guidance assumes some continued unevenness due to the Delta variant. At the high end of the range, our assumptions include a normalized procedure cadence in the cath lab and a minimal impact from COVID based on global vaccine distribution. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the 24% to 26% range. In summary, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We executed well and are building for the future through strategic investments in innovation, clinical evidence and commercial excellence. We are well positioned for a successful fiscal year '22 and beyond as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

I guess the answer is yes because you've seen it now for 2 quarters in a row as we transition to green. And now green is our phase, which is Abiomed 2.0 execution. So starting with is just the product innovation. If you just break it out and look at the product growth, CP grew 52%, which is primarily driven by existing indications we have today for high-risk PCI and shock. 5.0 and 5.5 combined grew to 115%, and that was driven by a 209% growth in 5.5. 
Impella RP, which we're just starting now to roll out SmartAssist grew 71%. It has exclusive FDA approvals and is also approved for the emergency use for COVID. And ECMO, we are going slower to continue to evaluate and innovate. And so the demand does exceed our willingness to ship because it's similar to when we launched in Japan in the first year. So we've got lots of quarters ahead of just strong growth in those products. On clinical research, we've got abstract presentations that are being converted now to publications. The big ones are PROTECT III, which is the largest prospective FDA study on high-risk PCI. 
You've got RESTORE-EF, which is a best practice protocol showing a permanent improvement in ejection fraction. You have the completion of the NCSI presentation, which is going to publication, and you also have the presentation going to publication for the Japan Impella cardiogenic shock study. So there's a lot of information plus there's just tremendous momentum and excitement around STEMI DTU, which now we've at least got to about half of our enrollable sites and PROTECT IV, which we've started to enroll. 
And of course, ECP had a strong quarter, and we were able to do another 15 patients since the last earnings call. And then last, as you pointed out, we have made changes to the distribution. It's very focused now to strengthen our ability to move with speed but also have a hub and spoke interaction so that we continue to call on those spoke accounts, which continue to grow even during COVID as well as the network where the hub centers, which are through the most high-risk PCI and those complicated shock patients are transferred to, they also saw growth. 
So across the board, existing indications, shock and high-risk PCI had strong growth. We feel very confident coming out of Q1, but we've got more to do. And we're very excited now to just be executing and allowing us to treat more patients than ever before."

And that will come at the end of the year, but we also are getting full support for surgeons that are already using the Impella 5.5. So as you see from the numbers on the demand, all those products with the exception of 2.5 are increasing. 
And for high-risk PCI half of our patients for high-risk PCI now are single access, which is the preferred method with the leaders out there. And so that really does address some of the ease of use and things around the cath lab for high-risk PCI. And remember, when you do a single access, they do the PCI, and they also do the Impella in the same hole rather than 2 holes. So we've got a lot of momentum and where it comes together is in this heart team approach. 
Some of those patients that are high-risk revaxerization get a CABG with a 5.5 and some of those patients go to the cath lab to get high-risk PCI. So the network and the referral stream is coming together. But again, if you're in the field and you're a customer, Abiomed has all the new technology. We have the most clinical studies and we provide the best 24/7 support that's also in the cloud with the SmartAssist and the Impella Connect platform."

The Impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. We -- in our Investor Day last year, Dr. Ed Soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at Cleveland Clinic. And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the la",449,"Matt, thanks for the question. The Impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. We -- in our Investor Day last year, Dr. Ed Soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at Cleveland Clinic. And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the largest Ecobadand transplant centers. You see it in the Midwest and now you also see it in the East Coast in other hospitals. 
And the reason it's important is because prior to the Impella 5.5, if you wanted a VAD, something that could do more than 5 liters, you essentially had to do a sternotomy, including for our old AB5000, and you'd have to spread the ribs and then these devices require the surgeon for the implantables to make an incision and core out a quarter-sized hole in the left ventricle. And so all those things have adverse events. And if a patient is in shock or has trouble coming off the heart-lung machine, that's not something you necessarily want to do. 
And if the patient's 70 and above and you put them on ECMO, you tend to load the ventricle. And then that takes away their ability to get back to baseline. And again, a 70-year-old is not going to get a transplant nor do they want a permanent implantable device in them that requires the most expensive and invasive surgery. 
So what the 5.5 does is it really opens up these Class III and Class IV patients that are acutely decompensated or have been in more profound shock that had longer support and need their kidneys, the kidneys have to have the benefit of being unloaded at the heart. And it really does become a game changer and a new therapy. And so we're excited. We expect this product to continue to have growth -- strong growth over the next several years. 
And we have submitted it for approval in Japan, where we think it will be even a stronger driver because in Japan, they don't necessarily do a lot of sternotomies or believe in transplants. They already do stem cells and things around myocardia recovery and having an Impella 5.5 in immediately unloads the patient supports the hemodynamics. These patients can come off all of the inotropes, their kidneys make urine. We've even had anecdotal data of patients that are listed for heart and kidney transplant having their kidneys recover after a prolonged use of the 5.5 while they go now to just a heart transplant. 
So it's a breakthrough product because it does what a lot of the heart surgeons have always wanted, which is a minimally invasive weanable pump and that's what it's continuing to do."

And our design is really to match what our customers now want. And what they want is the higher flow of the CP with single access. 
So we're going to go to -- from limited market release to the end of the fiscal year '22 to midyear fiscal '23. But the learning curve has been met, and the majority of them really feel comfortable with the CP and single access. And so it's a benefit for the patient. And if you look at, again, this quarter, 50% of our high-risk PCI patients use single access and it's an all-time high for high-risk PCI. 
And the current sheet isn't compatible for that. So based on the customer feedback, we're now going to align the technology for the next-gen Impella CP with the XR sheet that can do single access. And in the short term, we're growing. We'll put more investment into the single access approval and training that we have from the FDA. And as you look at clinical abstracts that have been out, whether it's PROTECT III or RESTORE EF, our bleeding at Bar II and our vascular complications are in the low single digits. 
And it's very similar to TAVR in that the experienced users are now comfortable with the 14 French access. And when it comes to bleeding and vascular rates in the cath lab, were actually equivalent or lower than TAVR because our catheter is already 9 French. So long term, the Impella ECP will kind of eliminate any of those concerns for that late majority. But overall, our outcomes for vascular complications and bleeding are much better and our customers want the higher flow from CP."

I do expect to see the ASPs continuing to drive tailwinds in the second half of the year, and it really comes down to a few things. Number one is, our surgical business continues to perform extremely well. As Mike mentioned in his remarks, we're up 200% on the 5.5 in the U.S. We still have a long runway to go in terms of opening new sites. Just as anecdotally, we were over 600 sites with the 5.0. 
And so the average -- the ASP on the 5.5 is obviously significantly higher than the 5.0. And we still continue to benefit from the favorable mix with the Impella 2.5 becoming a smaller piece of the business versus CP. So I do expect to see that positive trend on ASPs continuing through at least in the second half of the year and beyond. 
In terms of the Impella Connect sites, at the end of the quarter, we were obviously close to almost over 1,160 sites in the U.S., so about 82% of our sites had in Impella Connect and over 80% of our patients are being supported in the cloud on Impella Connect. So we continue to make progress there, and we continue to accelerate some of that rollout in Europe as well as in Japan."

On preCARDIA, without giving specifics, that early feasibility study is completed. The safety data has been submitted. But again, we're continuing to enroll patients there as you make certain improvements and changes to the product. So that's in process. 
We do see it in the midterm based on our current regulatory path. So we'll give more focus on that. It's not long term. It's in the midterm, which both from more patients to getting it out on the market as a commercial product. That's our time line. It really does augment what we're already doing. That referral stream -- some of those patients are decompensating because they have advanced corner disease and are great candidates for high-risk PCI with Impella Support. 
Some of those may get worse and end up in cardiogenic shock and may need longer support and have kidney issues, so they're going to get the Impella 5.5. And we're very excited about it. Relative to the non-GAAP, most of our peers for several years now have been reporting non-GAAP, I think it's more transparent in the fact that we've been doing certain types of deals. It doesn't change our mindset overall on acquisitions. 
If we see something that strengthens our strategy or our intellectual property. And to remind everyone, we were one of the original investors and we own 30% of preCARDIA when it got started. So we were there from the beginning. And that's what you'll continue to see us do is there's ideas and things out there that we're experts in, and we might help support and innovate, but then we're willing and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that. 
So we're going to stay focused on organic growth, but obviously, we're going to be opportunistic where we can acquire more breakthrough technology that matches our strategy."

And so if you're a surgeon, whether you're at a transplant center or just a center that does open heart surgery, the Impella 5.5 is a must-have. You already have ECMO now. So part of this now is leveraging our ECPELLA in those relationships. 
If you're a heart failure cardiologist, you're in the ICU or you're in the referring community so you want to see the data around high-risk PCI. And in fact, we have a Executive Committee part of PROTECT IV, which are the leading heart failure cardiologists. So think of PROTECT IV as an interventional cardiology and heart failure cardiology study so that we can transition the mindset of just optical medical management for those patients for them to think about Protected PCI with the potential improvement in ejection fraction post treatment. 
So those things leverage well. And then from preCARDIA, it puts us more upstream with those acute on chronic patients, which if they escalate, will end up on 5.5 or BTR. So there's great synergy. And the way we overlay our distribution on that is we're the largest distribution calling on every cath lab and surgical suite out in the community. We're also the largest distribution with a dedicated team now working at those top transplant and VAD centers that hub and spoke, and we even leverage the relationships. 
And again, all the patients are in the cloud. So as they go from one hospital to the other, there's information to transfer. Our people are involved, and there is even a dedicated DRG from CMS to accept the patient on Impella support and manage them. So we feel very confident in the future, partly because of the innovation, but also just because of the clinical research that we're doing, showing that we continue to improve outcomes for these patients that are very sick populations that have the opportunity to not only survive but go home with their own heart."

Someone has said the other day, if we had a crystal ball before COVID, we would have designed CAMP PCI for that reason alone. And we were fortunate and lucky that we had already had the concept and put in place a faculty to do live cases, to do interactive training and have CME credits for physicians before COVID hit. 
So we were doing one live case a week. Now we do one every 2 weeks with the top leaders in the space. There's over 50 live cases that are up on the Internet. And the numbers show that the people who are most engaged in CAMP are the higher performers and growing the most, but of course, that's a biased sample for that reason. But there's just tremendous amount of opportunity to grow and to teach wire skills information around hemodynamics, give CME credits and things around just doing a better PCI. 
We do believe it's been very helpful, and it only has gotten more important for us and for our customers because of COVID. We continue to do virtual training and advisory boards. And then we reserve the right to do in-person meetings where it's going to be more hands on. But the type of training and what we can do now on the Internet with the password-protected user group is pretty phenomenal. I think what will happen with heart failure and with surgery is it's further going to expand the knowledge base of our users that will also allow them to share and spread best practices and tips and tricks at a faster pace, which does improve outcomes. And again, our outcomes are improving survival and native heart recovery. So these are big items versus maybe 4 hours less than the ICU."

My question is if you're looking at the base business, I know it's very hard to parse out any sort of backlog or whatever from COVID, but it feels like this is not the type of market that would necessarily have that. And I guess my question is on CAMP PCI. I mean, just a follow-up on that point you made, Mike, what a great time to be turning virtual. 
And I'm wondering if you're starting to get any of those physicians that were the sort of lower volume users that were more dramatically impacted by some of the data that we saw a few -- 2 years ago out of HA. Have they started to express interest in getting involved again? And if not, what are they waiting for?"

So as we disclosed last year, the sites that were the low users or mid users, so it's sometimes in the community. They actually went up because they ended up keeping patients and doing more high-risk PCI. And the biggest drops were in the hub centers, the big centers, which tended to be the COVID centers. 
So part of our COVID playbook is making sure that with our distribution calling on the transplant centers and the distribution calling on all the cath labs and surgical suites in the outlying centers that we coordinate of finding those patients out there. And by finding those patients out there, we've turned on a direct-to-patient initiative and a referring physician network. And then we try to link that in with teaching people where they can go to CAMP PCI, watch live cases potentially interact with some of these experts and do kind of film reviews. So every Wednesday is -- or every other Wednesday now is the live case. 
The CAMP has people submit cases, and they explain it. So we have a tremendous amount of case studies already put on there. And it does allow us then to kind of leverage and network the top users that can do it from their own computer at home or in the office rather than having to get on a plane and fly everywhere. So it's been very helpful. And what we continue to see in Q1, again, is the smaller, the midsize and the large centers are all growing, and that's partly why we're able to have such a strong quarter for high-risk PCI."

Abiomed reported a strong start to our fiscal year '22 with global record revenue and record patient utilization in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In Q1, we delivered revenue of $253 million, up 53% versus prior year and up 5% versus prior quarter. Within the quarter, we achieved a 26.2% non-GAAP operating margin while continuing to invest with a focus on extending our lead in innovation, advancing clinical evidence and building a premier commercial team.
Our balance sheet remains robust with $805 million in cash and 0 debt, while acquiring preCARDIA, a heart failure company. We grew our IP portfolio to 1,216 Impella patents and over 1,000 patents pending. We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and Abiomed 2.0 continues to drive our success.
I am proud of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives. On today's call, I will highlight progress on our product innovation milestones for Impella 5.5 and RP, the regulatory status for Impella ECP and briefly discuss our strategy to be the leading company for all cardiologists and heart surgeons at every heart hospital, which means they have a cath lab and a surgical suite.
Beginning with innovation, the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform very well. In the quarter, our U.S. surgical revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 17% versus prior quarter as we expanded this life-saving device to 46 more sites or 257 sites out of the 1,113 heart hospitals in total. Impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product. It does not require a sternotomy or coring of the left ventricle, and it is a forward flow, fully unloading, weanable heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant in less than 60 minutes via the axillary artery in the shoulder.
The minimally invasive implant also allows for early ambulation for the patient which correlates to faster recovery and better outcomes. The longer usage time for the Impella 5.5 allows the SmartAssist software to track aortic pressure, left ventricular pressure, make predictive analysis on volume and right heart stability and communicate in the cloud with Impella Connect. We look forward to continuing to roll this device out to the remaining 856 heart hospitals in the U.S. and many more outside the U.S.
We also received FDA premarket approval for the Impella RP with SmartAssist as safe and effective to treat acute right heart failure. This smart pump is the next generation of right heart support and already has exclusive weaning capability and FDA approval for right heart failure with multiple FDA studies and a recent emergency use authorization for COVID patients with pulmonary embolism.
It is the first single venous access percutaneous heart pump with a sensor for the right ventricle. This sensor technology provides real-time guidance and trends that help with pump management and weaning. Much of this groundbreaking information on the right ventricle will be published and will elucidate the field of right heart failure. The Impella CP, Impella 5.5 and Impella RP now all utilize SmartAssist software, enhanced with Impella Connect to enable remote monitoring from any Internet-connected device through a secure HIPAA-compliant website.
The Impella Connect software is now live at more than 80% of our U.S. sites and approximately 80% of our U.S. patients on support are monitored in the cloud. No other company in this space offers this capability or 24/7 service to the hospital, which is ideal with COVID. We also continued to accelerate the rollout of Impella Connect in Germany and Japan.
Next, we remain ahead of schedule on our Impella ECP early feasibility study, EFS. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and measures 9 French in diameter, easing insertion and removal from the body. This allows for a smaller access site optimal for Protected PCI, which we believe will continue to drive better outcomes and overall utilization. To date, we have achieved our initial FDA study milestones, enrolled 25 patients and submitted additional clinical data to the FDA for review. We plan to expand this breakthrough technology to new sites with product enhancements already implemented in the EFS process to up to 50 patients.
In parallel, based on our interaction with the FDA, we have started to prepare the details of the single-arm pivotal Impella ECP high-risk PCI study. Next quarter, we expect to confirm our IDE protocol and submit for approval with the goal to enroll our first pivotal patient for high-risk PCI by the end of our fiscal year. We want to complement the FDA for this EFS program overall, which allows for faster innovation, real-time safety feedback and accelerated access to new technology for U.S. patients.
Finally, our strategy to become the leading player for the heart team, which includes interventional cardiologists, heart failure cardiologists, intensivists and heart surgeons, grows stronger. Our breakthrough platform now includes the Impella portfolio, ECMO with Breethe, ECPELLA and recently acquired preCARDIA. preCARDIA was designated by the FDA as a breakthrough technology and will complement our existing product portfolio, increased options for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure called ADHF and expand our relationship with heart failure specialists managing the ICU.
Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years of age, and we believe this device has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for the treatment of millions of patients in early-stage ADHF, a new patient population for Abiomed. This strategic acquisition in combination with our continued Impella 5.5 success and our future Impella BTR pump marks our movement towards minimally invasive devices for the heart failure community including our hub-and-spoke hospital network in every region of the country.
To further enhance these clinical efforts, we continue to invest in commercial excellence with a focus on the broader heart failure community and the referral network. Specifically, we began our direct outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the undertreated high-risk PCI patient population of 440,000 U.S. patients.
We continue to deliver best-in-class training and education by leveraging CAMP PCI and transition to both virtual and on-site settings. We have seen physician traction on our educational platform through events such as live cases and advisory boards and are excited to expand CAMP PCI internationally, as well as add CAMP heart failure and CAMP heart surgery this fiscal year.
Before I conclude, I would like to share an inspiring patient story. John Fisher, 77, is a husband, grandfather and retired law enforcement officer from Ashland, Ohio. John has been experiencing chest pain for more than a year -- had been. When the chest pain became more severe following his recovery from COVID-19, he decided to seek treatment. After an evaluation, John was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and evaluated for coronary artery bypass surgery, called CABG surgery. Due to a low ejection fraction of 15% and multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, John was turned down for surgery.
Interventional cardiologist, Dr. Atish Mathur, determined John was a candidate for Protected PCI with Impella. Dr. Mathur inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist while he performed a complete revascularization. John returned home 6 days later. Today, his heart function is normal with a current EF of 55%, and he enjoys walking his dogs, woodworking and spending time with his grandson, who happens to work at Abiomed in headquarters.
In closing, we will continue to create and deliver value by successfully advancing our innovation, clinical research and commercial distribution. We remain steadfast to our mission of creating the field of heart recovery and driving a new standard of care for multiple growing patient populations around the world. Q1 was a solid start and we believe we are well positioned for success in fiscal year '22. I would like to thank our employees and customers for their dedication to the mission of recovering hearts and saving lives and we appreciate the ongoing support of our shareholders.
I would like to now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting",987,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting with the U.S. Total U.S. revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $207 million. This growth was driven by a 43% increase in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a higher reorder rate.
We are encouraged by the continued recovery from COVID within the quarter as we continued to see patients working their way back into the system. At the end of our fiscal Q1, in the U.S., the CP is in now 1,528 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 665 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 257 sites, up 46 sites versus prior quarter.
Lastly, the Impella RP is in 609 sites, up 21 sites versus Q4. Our U.S. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly above 100%. And average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was 4.7 units per site. This is consistent with the inventory levels of the prior 2 quarters.
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $45 million, up 51% versus prior year. European revenue increased 64% year-over-year due to a strong recovery in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a benefit from the foreign exchange rate. Our Japan business delivered $11.3 million in revenue, up 26% year-over-year due to a 78% growth in patient utilization, offsetting lower site openings.
In the quarter, we opened 5 new sites, bringing our total sites to 171. This compares to the 10 site openings last quarter and 13 site openings in Q1 of '21. We have seen some impact due to hospital restrictions related to COVID-19 and the Summer Olympics, which limits our ability to train new sites. But this is more timing as our backlog for new sites in Japan remains robust, and we expect to open more sites in the second half of the year as vaccination rates increase and hospital restrictions ease.
Gross margin in Q1 was 82.1% compared to 78.2% in the same period of the prior year. The 390 basis point increase was primarily driven by higher volume and favorable sales mix.
Our Q1 GAAP financial results for the quarter are summarized in our press release and earnings deck. For the remainder of the call, I'm going to provide the highlights of our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis in order to give greater transparency on the impact from the preCARDIA acquisition and to be consistent with our peers. A full reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results are summarized in our press release and earnings deck and are available on the Investors section of abiomed.com.
R&D expense for the first quarter totaled $38 million, a 43% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by clinical costs for PROTECT IV and STEMI DTU randomized controlled trials as well as our investments in new products such as ECP and BTR. We believe that clinical evidence and innovation of smaller, smarter, more connected devices will drive sustainable long-term growth.
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $103 million, an increase of $35 million or 51% versus prior year. The year-over-year increase is driven by head count additions to our distribution team, our direct-to-patient initiative, higher spend on training and education, and COVID-related onetime cost actions from the prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 94% to $66 million in the quarter, which translated to non-GAAP operating margin of 26.2%. Our margin expansion of 550 basis points was primarily due to higher volume which more than offset our growth-enhancing investments. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $51 million or $1.10 per share, up 95% versus Q1 of '21. Our year-over-year performance was driven by higher volume and a lower effective tax rate. Our balance sheet remains debt-free and we ended the quarter with $805 million of cash and marketable securities after funding our strategic investment to acquire the remaining shares of preCARDIA.
In terms of full year guidance, keep in mind that our fiscal year experiences seasonality. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for all cardiovascular devices due to summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. In this summer, we believe it is being even more exasperated based on the pent-up vacation demand from COVID last year.
With that said, we expect Q2 revenue to be in line or slightly down from our Q1 record revenue performance of $253 million in our summer quarter. As we transition to the back half of the year, we typically expect to see sequential lift in Q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. And as we finish the fiscal year in Q4, our March quarter, we expect to deliver our best results.
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in our outlook, we are now raising our full year revenue guidance and expect it to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, up 22% to 24% for the year. This is an increase from our original guidance range of $990 million to $1.03 billion, up 17% to 22% for the year. The low end of our guidance assumes some continued unevenness due to the Delta variant. At the high end of the range, our assumptions include a normalized procedure cadence in the cath lab and a minimal impact from COVID based on global vaccine distribution. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the 24% to 26% range. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We executed well and are building for the future through strategic investments in innovation, clinical evidence and commercial excellence. We are well positioned for a successful fiscal year '22 and beyond as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

I guess the answer is yes because you've seen it now for 2 quarters in a row as we transition to green. And now green is our phase, which is Abiomed 2.0 execution. So starting with is just the product innovation. If you just break it out and look at the product growth, CP grew 52%, which is primarily driven by existing indications we have today for high-risk PCI and shock. 5.0 and 5.5 combined grew to 115%, and that was driven by a 209% growth in 5.5.
Impella RP, which we're just starting now to roll out SmartAssist, grew 71%. It has exclusive FDA approvals and is also approved for the emergency use for COVID. And ECMO, we are going slower to continue to evaluate and innovate. And so the demand does exceed our willingness to ship because it's similar to when we launched in Japan in the first year.
So we've got lots of quarters ahead of just strong growth in those products. On clinical research, we've got abstract presentations that are being converted now to publications. The big ones are PROTECT III, which is the largest prospective FDA study on high-risk PCI. You've got RESTORE EF, which is a best practice protocol showing a permanent improvement in ejection fraction. You have the completion of the NCSI presentation, which is going to publication, and you also have the presentation going to publication for the Japan Impella cardiogenic shock study.
So there's a lot of information plus there's just tremendous momentum and excitement around STEMI DTU, which now we've at least got to about half of our enrollable sites, and PROTECT IV, which we've started to enroll. And of course, ECP had a strong quarter, and we were able to do another 15 patients since the last earnings call.
And then last, as you pointed out, we have made changes to the distribution. It's very focused now to strengthen our ability to move with speed but also have a hub-and-spoke interaction so that we continue to call on those spoke accounts, which continue to grow even during COVID, as well as the network where the hub centers, which are through the most high-risk PCI and those complicated shock patients are transferred to, they also saw growth.
So across the board, existing indications, shock and high-risk PCI had strong growth. We feel very confident coming out of Q1, but we've got more to do. And we're very excited now to just be executing and allowing us to treat more patients than ever before."

So as you see from the numbers on the demand, all those products with the exception of 2.5 are increasing.
And for high-risk PCI, half of our patients for high-risk PCI now are single access, which is the preferred method with the leaders out there. And so that really does address some of the ease of use and things around the cath lab for high-risk PCI. And remember, when you do a single access, they do the PCI and they also do the Impella in the same hole rather than 2 holes. So we've got a lot of momentum and where it comes together is in this heart team approach.
Some of those patients that are high-risk revascularization get a CABG with a 5.5 and some of those patients go to the cath lab to get high-risk PCI. So the network and the referral stream is coming together. But again, if you're in the field and you're a customer, Abiomed has all the new technology. We have the most clinical studies and we provide the best 24/7 support that's also in the cloud with the SmartAssist and the Impella Connect platform."

The Impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. We -- in our Investor Day last year, Dr. Ed Soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at Cleveland Clinic. And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the la",451,"Matt, thanks for the question. The Impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. We -- in our Investor Day last year, Dr. Ed Soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at Cleveland Clinic. And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the largest ECMO, VAD and transplant centers, you see it in the Midwest and now you also see it in the East Coast in other hospitals.
And the reason it's important is because prior to the Impella 5.5, if you wanted a VAD, something that could do more than 5 liters, you essentially had to do a sternotomy, including for our old AB5000, and you'd have to spread the ribs and then these devices require the surgeon, for the implantables, to make an incision and core out a quarter-sized hole in the left ventricle. And so all those things have adverse events. And if a patient is in shock or has trouble coming off the heart-lung machine, that's not something you necessarily want to do.
And if the patient's 70 and above and you put them on ECMO, you tend to load the ventricle. And then that takes away their ability to get back to baseline. And again, a 70-year-old is not going to get a transplant nor do they want a permanent implantable device in them that requires the most expensive and invasive surgery.
So what the 5.5 does is it really opens up these Class III and Class IV patients that are acutely decompensated or have been in more profound shock that need longer support and need their kidneys, the kidneys have to have the benefit of being unloaded at the heart. And it really does become a game changer and a new therapy. And so we're excited. We expect this product to continue to have growth -- strong growth over the next several years.
And we have submitted it for approval in Japan, where we think it will be even a stronger driver because in Japan, they don't necessarily do a lot of sternotomies or believe in transplants. They already do stem cells and things around myocardia recovery, and having an Impella 5.5 in immediately unloads the patient, supports the hemodynamics. These patients can come off all of the inotropes, their kidneys make urine. We've even had anecdotal data of patients that are listed for heart and kidney transplant having their kidneys recover after a prolonged use of the 5.5 while they go now to just a heart transplant.
So it's a breakthrough product because it does what a lot of the heart surgeons have always wanted, which is a minimally invasive weanable pump and that's what it's continuing to do."

The numbers that we did were primarily from 2 physicians. There's tremendous excitement from all the centers to use the ECP. And if we can do up to anywhere from 20 to 50 centers doing high-risk PCI in a single arm to compare with our other data, we feel very comfortable we'll be able to enroll pretty quickly.
And on a numbers basis, we haven't given any numbers out, but we -- but what you're looking at is an equivalency. So things around access closure as well as the valve safety are the most important parameters, and we feel very confident in this device. And the fact that it's just a 9 French in and out really does simplify the utilization for high-risk PCI.
So we're happy to be ahead of schedule. We're pleased with the process. We've already made and implemented some new technology changes. That's the benefit of early feasibility. So we're going to utilize the next up to another 25 patients to continue to keep the experience level there so we can roll right into the ECP centers. And we're ahead of schedule. We're confident.

And our design is really to match what our customers now want. And what they want is the higher flow of the CP with single access.
So we're going to go to -- from limited market release to the end of the fiscal year '22 to midyear fiscal '23. But the learning curve has been met, and the majority of them really feel comfortable with the CP and single access. And so it's a benefit for the patient. And if you look at, again, this quarter, 50% of our high-risk PCI patients use single access and it's an all-time high for high-risk PCI. And the current sheath isn't compatible for that.
So based on the customer feedback, we're now going to align the technology for the next-gen Impella CP with the XR Sheath that can do single access. And in the short term we're growing, we'll put more investment into the single access approval and training that we have from the FDA. And as you look at clinical abstracts that have been out, whether it's PROTECT III or RESTORE EF, our bleeding in PROTECT III and our vascular complications are in the low single digits. And it's very similar to TAVR in that the experienced users are now comfortable with the 14 French access. And when it comes to bleeding and vascular rates in the cath lab, we're actually equivalent or lower than TAVR because our catheter is already 9 French.
So long term, the Impella ECP will kind of eliminate any of those concerns for that late majority. But overall, our outcomes for vascular complications and bleeding are much better and our customers want the higher flow from CP."

And so the average ASP on the 5.5 is obviously significantly higher than the 5.0. And we still continue to benefit from the favorable mix with the Impella 2.5 becoming a smaller piece of the business versus CP. So I do expect to see that positive trend on ASPs continuing through at least in the second half of the year and beyond.
In terms of the Impella Connect sites, at the end of the quarter, we were obviously close to almost over 1,160 sites in the U.S. So about 82% of our sites had Impella Connect and over 80% of our patients are being supported in the cloud on Impella Connect.

It's in the midterm, which both from more patients to getting it out on the market as a commercial product. That's our time line.
It really does augment what we're already doing. That referral stream -- some of those patients are decompensating because they have advanced coronary artery disease and are great candidates for high-risk PCI with Impella support. Some of those may get worse and end up in cardiogenic shock and may need longer support and have kidney issues, so they're going to get the Impella 5.5. And we're very excited about it.
Relative to the non-GAAP, most of our peers, for several years now, have been reporting non-GAAP. I think it's more transparent in the fact that we've been doing certain types of deals. It doesn't change our mindset overall on acquisitions. If we see something that strengthens our strategy or our intellectual property. And to remind everyone, we were one of the original investors and we own 30% of preCARDIA when it got started.
So we were there from the beginning.

And so if you're a surgeon, whether you're at a transplant center or just a center that does open heart surgery, the Impella 5.5 is a must-have. You already have ECMO now. So part of this now is leveraging our ECPELLA in those relationships.
If you're a heart failure cardiologist, you're in the ICU or you're in the referring community. So you want to see the data around high-risk PCI. And in fact, we have an Executive Committee part of PROTECT IV, which are the leading heart failure cardiologists. So think of PROTECT IV as an interventional cardiology and heart failure cardiology study so that we can transition the mindset of just optical medical management for those patients for them to think about Protected PCI with the potential improvement in ejection fraction post treatment.
So those things leverage well. And then from preCARDIA, it puts us more upstream with those acute on chronic patients, which if they escalate, will end up on 5.5 or BTR. So there's great synergy. And the way we overlay our distribution on that is we're the largest distribution calling on every cath lab and surgical suite out in the community. We're also the largest distribution with a dedicated team now working at those top transplant and VAD centers that hub and spoke, and we even leverage the relationships. And again, all the patients are in the cloud. So as they go from one hospital to the other, there's information to transfer. Our people are involved, and there is even a dedicated DRG from CMS to accept the patient on Impella support and manage them.
So we feel very confident in the future, partly because of the innovation, but also just because of the clinical research that we're doing, showing that we continue to improve outcomes for these patients that are very sick populations that have the opportunity to not only survive but go home with their own heart."

So we were doing one live case a week. Now we do one every 2 weeks with the top leaders in the space. There's over 50 live cases that are up on the Internet. And the numbers show that the people who are most engaged in CAMP are the higher performers and growing the most, but of course, that's a biased sample for that reason.

I think what will happen with heart failure and with surgery is it's further going to expand the knowledge base of our users that will also allow them to share and spread best practices and tips and tricks at a faster pace, which does improve outcomes. And again, our outcomes are improving survival and native heart recovery. So these are big items versus maybe 4 hours less than the ICU."

It will run in the cloud, and it will have high flow. And it's, again, forward flows.
So it allows you to wean off the patient while you watch the wall tension in the left ventricle and increased coronary flow. So it's another breakthrough technology. There's tremendous excitement. We've been working on it for a while, and we're very excited to do our first patient here in the U.S. end of the year."

And I'm wondering if you're starting to get any of those physicians that were -- the sort of lower volume users that were more dramatically impacted by some of the data that we saw a few -- 2 years ago out of AHA.

So as we disclosed last year, the sites that were the low users or mid users, so it's sometimes in the community. They actually went up because they ended up keeping patients and doing more high-risk PCI. And the biggest drops were in the hub centers, the big centers, which tended to be the COVID centers.
So part of our COVID playbook is making sure that with our distribution calling on the transplant centers and the distribution calling on all the cath labs and surgical suites in the outlying centers that we coordinate of finding those patients out there. And by finding those patients out there, we've turned on a direct-to-patient initiative and a referring physician network. And then we try to link that in with teaching people where they can go to CAMP PCI, watch live cases, potentially interact with some of these experts and do kind of film reviews. So every Wednesday is -- or every other Wednesday now is the live case.
The CAMP has people submit cases, and they explain it. So we have a tremendous amount of case studies already put on there. And it does allow us then to kind of leverage and network the top users that can do it from their own computer at home or in the office rather than having to get on a plane and fly everywhere.
So it's been very helpful. And what we continue to see in Q1, again, is the smaller, the midsize and the large centers are all growing, and that's partly why we're able to have such a strong quarter for high-risk PCI."

Abiomed reported a strong start to our fiscal year '22 with global record revenue and record patient utilization in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In Q1, we delivered revenue of $253 million, up 53% versus prior year and up 5% versus prior quarter. Within the quarter, we achieved a 26.2% non-GAAP operating margin while continuing to invest with a focus on extending our lead in innovation, advancing clinical evidence and building a premier commercial team.
Our balance sheet remains robust with $805 million in cash and 0 debt, while acquiring preCARDIA, a heart failure company. We grew our IP portfolio to 1,216 Impella patents and over 1,000 patents pending. We have maintained our disciplined execution on our strategic goals and Abiomed 2.0 continues to drive our success.
I am proud of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our patients and mission of recovering hearts and saving lives. On today's call, I will highlight progress on our product innovation milestones for Impella 5.5 and RP, the regulatory status for Impella ECP and briefly discuss our strategy to be the leading company for all cardiologists and heart surgeons at every heart hospital, which means they have a cath lab and a surgical suite.
Beginning with innovation, the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform very well. In the quarter, our U.S. surgical revenue grew 115% year-over-year and 17% versus prior quarter as we expanded this life-saving device to 46 more sites or 257 sites out of the 1,113 heart hospitals in total. Impella 5.5 is a revolutionary product. It does not require a sternotomy or coring of the left ventricle, and it is a forward flow, fully unloading, weanable heart pump designed for heart surgeons to implant in less than 60 minutes via the axillary artery in the shoulder.
The minimally invasive implant also allows for early ambulation for the patient which correlates to faster recovery and better outcomes. The longer usage time for the Impella 5.5 allows the SmartAssist software to track aortic pressure, left ventricular pressure, make predictive analysis on volume and right heart stability and communicate in the cloud with Impella Connect. We look forward to continuing to roll this device out to the remaining 856 heart hospitals in the U.S. and many more outside the U.S.
We also received FDA premarket approval for the Impella RP with SmartAssist as safe and effective to treat acute right heart failure. This smart pump is the next generation of right heart support and already has exclusive weaning capability and FDA approval for right heart failure with multiple FDA studies and a recent emergency use authorization for COVID patients with pulmonary embolism.
It is the first single venous access percutaneous heart pump with a sensor for the right ventricle. This sensor technology provides real-time guidance and trends that help with pump management and weaning. Much of this groundbreaking information on the right ventricle will be published and will elucidate the field of right heart failure. The Impella CP, Impella 5.5 and Impella RP now all utilize SmartAssist software, enhanced with Impella Connect to enable remote monitoring from any Internet-connected device through a secure HIPAA-compliant website.
The Impella Connect software is now live at more than 80% of our U.S. sites and approximately 80% of our U.S. patients on support are monitored in the cloud. No other company in this space offers this capability or 24/7 service to the hospital, which is ideal with COVID. We also continued to accelerate the rollout of Impella Connect in Germany and Japan.
Next, we remain ahead of schedule on our Impella ECP early feasibility study, EFS. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and measures 9 French in diameter, easing insertion and removal from the body. This allows for a smaller access site optimal for Protected PCI, which we believe will continue to drive better outcomes and overall utilization. To date, we have achieved our initial FDA study milestones, enrolled 25 patients and submitted additional clinical data to the FDA for review. We plan to expand this breakthrough technology to new sites with product enhancements already implemented in the EFS process to up to 50 patients.
In parallel, based on our interaction with the FDA, we have started to prepare the details of the single-arm pivotal Impella ECP high-risk PCI study. Next quarter, we expect to confirm our IDE protocol and submit for approval with the goal to enroll our first pivotal patient for high-risk PCI by the end of our fiscal year. We want to complement the FDA for this EFS program overall, which allows for faster innovation, real-time safety feedback and accelerated access to new technology for U.S. patients.
Finally, our strategy to become the leading player for the heart team, which includes interventional cardiologists, heart failure cardiologists, intensivists and heart surgeons, grows stronger. Our breakthrough platform now includes the Impella portfolio, ECMO with Breethe, ECPELLA and recently acquired preCARDIA. preCARDIA was designated by the FDA as a breakthrough technology and will complement our existing product portfolio, increased options for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure called ADHF and expand our relationship with heart failure specialists managing the ICU.
Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years of age, and we believe this device has the potential to be a revolutionary tool for the treatment of millions of patients in early-stage ADHF, a new patient population for Abiomed. This strategic acquisition in combination with our continued Impella 5.5 success and our future Impella BTR pump marks our movement towards minimally invasive devices for the heart failure community including our hub-and-spoke hospital network in every region of the country.
To further enhance these clinical efforts, we continue to invest in commercial excellence with a focus on the broader heart failure community and the referral network. Specifically, we began our direct outreach referral programs that we expect will better identify the undertreated high-risk PCI patient population of 440,000 U.S. patients.
We continue to deliver best-in-class training and education by leveraging CAMP PCI and transition to both virtual and on-site settings. We have seen physician traction on our educational platform through events such as live cases and advisory boards and are excited to expand CAMP PCI internationally, as well as add CAMP heart failure and CAMP heart surgery this fiscal year.
Before I conclude, I would like to share an inspiring patient story. John Fisher, 77, is a husband, grandfather and retired law enforcement officer from Ashland, Ohio. John has been experiencing chest pain for more than a year -- had been. When the chest pain became more severe following his recovery from COVID-19, he decided to seek treatment. After an evaluation, John was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and evaluated for coronary artery bypass surgery, called CABG surgery. Due to a low ejection fraction of 15% and multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, John was turned down for surgery.
Interventional cardiologist, Dr. Atish Mathur, determined John was a candidate for Protected PCI with Impella. Dr. Mathur inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist while he performed a complete revascularization. John returned home 6 days later. Today, his heart function is normal with a current EF of 55%, and he enjoys walking his dogs, woodworking and spending time with his grandson, who happens to work at Abiomed in headquarters.
In closing, we will continue to create and deliver value by successfully advancing our innovation, clinical research and commercial distribution. We remain steadfast to our mission of creating the field of heart recovery and driving a new standard of care for multiple growing patient populations around the world. Q1 was a solid start and we believe we are well positioned for success in fiscal year '22. I would like to thank our employees and customers for their dedication to the mission of recovering hearts and saving lives and we appreciate the ongoing support of our shareholders.
I would like to now turn the call over to Todd Trapp, our CFO."

We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting",987,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with revenue of $253 million, an increase of 53% versus prior year, primarily due to the recovery in patient utilization from COVID-19. Starting with the U.S. Total U.S. revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $207 million. This growth was driven by a 43% increase in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a higher reorder rate.
We are encouraged by the continued recovery from COVID within the quarter as we continued to see patients working their way back into the system. At the end of our fiscal Q1, in the U.S., the CP is in now 1,528 sites. We have placed the Impella 5.0 in 665 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 257 sites, up 46 sites versus prior quarter.
Lastly, the Impella RP is in 609 sites, up 21 sites versus Q4. Our U.S. reorder performance in the quarter was slightly above 100%. And average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was 4.7 units per site. This is consistent with the inventory levels of the prior 2 quarters.
Outside the U.S., revenue totaled $45 million, up 51% versus prior year. European revenue increased 64% year-over-year due to a strong recovery in patient utilization, favorable sales mix and a benefit from the foreign exchange rate. Our Japan business delivered $11.3 million in revenue, up 26% year-over-year due to a 78% growth in patient utilization, offsetting lower site openings.
In the quarter, we opened 5 new sites, bringing our total sites to 171. This compares to the 10 site openings last quarter and 13 site openings in Q1 of '21. We have seen some impact due to hospital restrictions related to COVID-19 and the Summer Olympics, which limits our ability to train new sites. But this is more timing as our backlog for new sites in Japan remains robust, and we expect to open more sites in the second half of the year as vaccination rates increase and hospital restrictions ease.
Gross margin in Q1 was 82.1% compared to 78.2% in the same period of the prior year. The 390 basis point increase was primarily driven by higher volume and favorable sales mix.
Our Q1 GAAP financial results for the quarter are summarized in our press release and earnings deck. For the remainder of the call, I'm going to provide the highlights of our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis in order to give greater transparency on the impact from the preCARDIA acquisition and to be consistent with our peers. A full reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results are summarized in our press release and earnings deck and are available on the Investors section of abiomed.com.
R&D expense for the first quarter totaled $38 million, a 43% increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by clinical costs for PROTECT IV and STEMI DTU randomized controlled trials as well as our investments in new products such as ECP and BTR. We believe that clinical evidence and innovation of smaller, smarter, more connected devices will drive sustainable long-term growth.
SG&A expense for the quarter totaled $103 million, an increase of $35 million or 51% versus prior year. The year-over-year increase is driven by head count additions to our distribution team, our direct-to-patient initiative, higher spend on training and education, and COVID-related onetime cost actions from the prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 94% to $66 million in the quarter, which translated to non-GAAP operating margin of 26.2%. Our margin expansion of 550 basis points was primarily due to higher volume which more than offset our growth-enhancing investments. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $51 million or $1.10 per share, up 95% versus Q1 of '21. Our year-over-year performance was driven by higher volume and a lower effective tax rate. Our balance sheet remains debt-free and we ended the quarter with $805 million of cash and marketable securities after funding our strategic investment to acquire the remaining shares of preCARDIA.
In terms of full year guidance, keep in mind that our fiscal year experiences seasonality. Q2 is typically a slow quarter for all cardiovascular devices due to summertime slowdown in the cath lab and physician vacations. In this summer, we believe it is being even more exasperated based on the pent-up vacation demand from COVID last year.
With that said, we expect Q2 revenue to be in line or slightly down from our Q1 record revenue performance of $253 million in our summer quarter. As we transition to the back half of the year, we typically expect to see sequential lift in Q3 based on increased hospital activity and physician engagement. And as we finish the fiscal year in Q4, our March quarter, we expect to deliver our best results.
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and our confidence in our outlook, we are now raising our full year revenue guidance and expect it to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, up 22% to 24% for the year. This is an increase from our original guidance range of $990 million to $1.03 billion, up 17% to 22% for the year. The low end of our guidance assumes some continued unevenness due to the Delta variant. At the high end of the range, our assumptions include a normalized procedure cadence in the cath lab and a minimal impact from COVID based on global vaccine distribution. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the 24% to 26% range. 
In summary, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We executed well and are building for the future through strategic investments in innovation, clinical evidence and commercial excellence. We are well positioned for a successful fiscal year '22 and beyond as we continue to build the new field of heart recovery.

I guess the answer is yes because you've seen it now for 2 quarters in a row as we transition to green. And now green is our phase, which is Abiomed 2.0 execution. So starting with is just the product innovation. If you just break it out and look at the product growth, CP grew 52%, which is primarily driven by existing indications we have today for high-risk PCI and shock. 5.0 and 5.5 combined grew to 115%, and that was driven by a 209% growth in 5.5.
Impella RP, which we're just starting now to roll out SmartAssist, grew 71%. It has exclusive FDA approvals and is also approved for the emergency use for COVID. And ECMO, we are going slower to continue to evaluate and innovate. And so the demand does exceed our willingness to ship because it's similar to when we launched in Japan in the first year.
So we've got lots of quarters ahead of just strong growth in those products. On clinical research, we've got abstract presentations that are being converted now to publications. The big ones are PROTECT III, which is the largest prospective FDA study on high-risk PCI. You've got RESTORE EF, which is a best practice protocol showing a permanent improvement in ejection fraction. You have the completion of the NCSI presentation, which is going to publication, and you also have the presentation going to publication for the Japan Impella cardiogenic shock study.
So there's a lot of information plus there's just tremendous momentum and excitement around STEMI DTU, which now we've at least got to about half of our enrollable sites, and PROTECT IV, which we've started to enroll. And of course, ECP had a strong quarter, and we were able to do another 15 patients since the last earnings call.
And then last, as you pointed out, we have made changes to the distribution. It's very focused now to strengthen our ability to move with speed but also have a hub-and-spoke interaction so that we continue to call on those spoke accounts, which continue to grow even during COVID, as well as the network where the hub centers, which are through the most high-risk PCI and those complicated shock patients are transferred to, they also saw growth.
So across the board, existing indications, shock and high-risk PCI had strong growth. We feel very confident coming out of Q1, but we've got more to do. And we're very excited now to just be executing and allowing us to treat more patients than ever before."

And that will come at the end of the year, but we also are getting full support for surgeons that are already using the Impella 5.5. So as you see from the numbers on the demand, all those products with the exception of 2.5 are increasing.
And for high-risk PCI, half of our patients for high-risk PCI now are single access, which is the preferred method with the leaders out there. And so that really does address some of the ease of use and things around the cath lab for high-risk PCI. And remember, when you do a single access, they do the PCI and they also do the Impella in the same hole rather than 2 holes. So we've got a lot of momentum and where it comes together is in this heart team approach.
Some of those patients that are high-risk revascularization get a CABG with a 5.5 and some of those patients go to the cath lab to get high-risk PCI. So the network and the referral stream is coming together. But again, if you're in the field and you're a customer, Abiomed has all the new technology.

And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the la",451,"Matt, thanks for the question. The Impella 5.5 is a breakthrough product. We -- in our Investor Day last year, Dr. Ed Soltesz gave a presentation of how they use it in a protocol at Cleveland Clinic. And you'll see that out West with Cedars, one of the largest ECMO, VAD and transplant centers, you see it in the Midwest and now you also see it in the East Coast in other hospitals.
And the reason it's important is because prior to the Impella 5.5, if you wanted a VAD, something that could do more than 5 liters, you essentially had to do a sternotomy, including for our old AB5000, and you'd have to spread the ribs and then these devices require the surgeon, for the implantables, to make an incision and core out a quarter-sized hole in the left ventricle. And so all those things have adverse events. And if a patient is in shock or has trouble coming off the heart-lung machine, that's not something you necessarily want to do.
And if the patient's 70 and above and you put them on ECMO, you tend to load the ventricle. And then that takes away their ability to get back to baseline. And again, a 70-year-old is not going to get a transplant nor do they want a permanent implantable device in them that requires the most expensive and invasive surgery.
So what the 5.5 does is it really opens up these Class III and Class IV patients that are acutely decompensated or have been in more profound shock that need longer support and need their kidneys, the kidneys have to have the benefit of being unloaded at the heart. And it really does become a game changer and a new therapy. And so we're excited. We expect this product to continue to have growth -- strong growth over the next several years.
And we have submitted it for approval in Japan, where we think it will be even a stronger driver because in Japan, they don't necessarily do a lot of sternotomies or believe in transplants. They already do stem cells and things around myocardia recovery, and having an Impella 5.5 in immediately unloads the patient, supports the hemodynamics. These patients can come off all of the inotropes, their kidneys make urine. We've even had anecdotal data of patients that are listed for heart and kidney transplant having their kidneys recover after a prolonged use of the 5.5 while they go now to just a heart transplant.
So it's a breakthrough product because it does what a lot of the heart surgeons have always wanted, which is a minimally invasive weanable pump and that's what it's continuing to do."

The numbers that we did were primarily from 2 physicians. There's tremendous excitement from all the centers to use the ECP.

And on a numbers basis, we haven't given any numbers out, but we -- but what you're looking at is an equivalency. So things around access closure as well as the valve safety are the most important parameters, and we feel very confident in this device. And the fact that it's just a 9 French in and out really does simplify the utilization for high-risk PCI.
So we're happy to be ahead of schedule. We're pleased with the process. We've already made and implemented some new technology changes. That's the benefit of early feasibility. So we're going to utilize the next up to another 25 patients to continue to keep the experience level there so we can roll right into the ECP centers. And we're ahead of schedule. We're confident.

And our design is really to match what our customers now want. And what they want is the higher flow of the CP with single access.
So we're going to go to -- from limited market release to the end of the fiscal year '22 to midyear fiscal '23. But the learning curve has been met, and the majority of them really feel comfortable with the CP and single access. And so it's a benefit for the patient. And if you look at, again, this quarter, 50% of our high-risk PCI patients use single access and it's an all-time high for high-risk PCI. And the current sheath isn't compatible for that.
So based on the customer feedback, we're now going to align the technology for the next-gen Impella CP with the XR Sheath that can do single access. And in the short term we're growing, we'll put more investment into the single access approval and training that we have from the FDA. And as you look at clinical abstracts that have been out, whether it's PROTECT III or RESTORE EF, our bleeding in PROTECT III and our vascular complications are in the low single digits. And it's very similar to TAVR in that the experienced users are now comfortable with the 14 French access. And when it comes to bleeding and vascular rates in the cath lab, we're actually equivalent or lower than TAVR because our catheter is already 9 French.
So long term, the Impella ECP will kind of eliminate any of those concerns for that late majority. But overall, our outcomes for vascular complications and bleeding are much better and our customers want the higher flow from CP."

And so the average ASP on the 5.5 is obviously significantly higher than the 5.0. And we still continue to benefit from the favorable mix with the Impella 2.5 becoming a smaller piece of the business versus CP. So I do expect to see that positive trend on ASPs continuing through at least in the second half of the year and beyond.
In terms of the Impella Connect sites, at the end of the quarter, we were obviously close to almost over 1,160 sites in the U.S. So about 82% of our sites had Impella Connect and over 80% of our patients are being supported in the cloud on Impella Connect.

It's in the midterm, which both from more patients to getting it out on the market as a commercial product. That's our time line.
It really does augment what we're already doing. That referral stream -- some of those patients are decompensating because they have advanced coronary artery disease and are great candidates for high-risk PCI with Impella support. Some of those may get worse and end up in cardiogenic shock and may need longer support and have kidney issues, so they're going to get the Impella 5.5. And we're very excited about it.
Relative to the non-GAAP, most of our peers, for several years now, have been reporting non-GAAP. I think it's more transparent in the fact that we've been doing certain types of deals.

And that's what you'll continue to see us do, is there's ideas and things out there that we're experts in, and we might help support and innovate, but then we're willing and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that. So we're going to stay focused on organic growth, but obviously, we're going to be opportunistic where we can acquire more breakthrough technology that matches our strategy."

So you've got Impella 5.5, which you mentioned is having a lot of success with Class III and Class IV acutely decompensated heart failure patients. Now you have preCARDIA, which is sort of targeting that same population. You also have BTR still in the internal pipeline. So how do you think about the different roles for those products and how they complement versus duplicate one another?"

And so if you're a surgeon, whether you're at a transplant center or just a center that does open heart surgery, the Impella 5.5 is a must-have. You already have ECMO now. So part of this now is leveraging our ECPELLA in those relationships.
If you're a heart failure cardiologist, you're in the ICU or you're in the referring community. So you want to see the data around high-risk PCI. And in fact, we have an Executive Committee part of PROTECT IV, which are the leading heart failure cardiologists. So think of PROTECT IV as an interventional cardiology and heart failure cardiology study so that we can transition the mindset of just optical medical management for those patients for them to think about Protected PCI with the potential improvement in ejection fraction post treatment.
So those things leverage well. And then from preCARDIA, it puts us more upstream with those acute on chronic patients, which if they escalate, will end up on 5.5 or BTR. So there's great synergy. And the way we overlay our distribution on that is we're the largest distribution calling on every cath lab and surgical suite out in the community. We're also the largest distribution with a dedicated team now working at those top transplant and VAD centers that hub and spoke, and we even leverage the relationships. And again, all the patients are in the cloud. So as they go from one hospital to the other, there's information to transfer. Our people are involved, and there is even a dedicated DRG from CMS to accept the patient on Impella support and manage them.
So we feel very confident in the future, partly because of the innovation, but also just because of the clinical research that we're doing, showing that we continue to improve outcomes for these patients that are very sick populations that have the opportunity to not only survive but go home with their own heart."

And STEMI itself got complicated because of COVID and now Delta because some of the hospitals require additional steps and testing on those patients before they'll bring them into the cath lab.

Someone has said the other day, if we had had a crystal ball before COVID, we would have designed CAMP PCI for that reason alone. And we were fortunate and lucky that we had already had the concept and put in place a faculty to do live cases, to do interactive training and have CME credits for physicians before COVID hit.
So we were doing one live case a week. Now we do one every 2 weeks with the top leaders in the space. There's over 50 live cases that are up on the Internet. And the numbers show that the people who are most engaged in CAMP are the higher performers and growing the most, but of course, that's a biased sample for that reason. But there's just tremendous amount of opportunity to grow and to teach wire skills, information around hemodynamics, give CME credits and things around just doing a better PCI.
We do believe it's been very helpful, and it only has gotten more important for us and for our customers because of COVID. We continue to do virtual training and advisory boards. And then we reserve the right to do in-person meetings where it's going to be more hands on. But the type of training and what we can do now on the Internet with a password-protected user group is pretty phenomenal.
I think what will happen with heart failure and with surgery is it's further going to expand the knowledge base of our users that will also allow them to share and spread best practices and tips and tricks at a faster pace, which does improve outcomes. And again, our outcomes are improving survival and native heart recovery. So these are big items versus maybe 4 hours less than the ICU."

So as we disclosed last year, the sites that were the low users or mid users, so it's sometimes in the community. They actually went up because they ended up keeping patients and doing more high-risk PCI. And the biggest drops were in the hub centers, the big centers, which tended to be the COVID centers.
So part of our COVID playbook is making sure that with our distribution calling on the transplant centers and the distribution calling on all the cath labs and surgical suites in the outlying centers that we coordinate of finding those patients out there. And by finding those patients out there, we've turned on a direct-to-patient initiative and a referring physician network. And then we try to link that in with teaching people where they can go to CAMP PCI, watch live cases, potentially interact with some of these experts and do kind of film reviews. So every Wednesday is -- or every other Wednesday now is the live case.
The CAMP has people submit cases, and they explain it. So we have a tremendous amount of case studies already put on there. And it does allow us then to kind of leverage and network the top users that can do it from their own computer at home or in the office rather than having to get on a plane and fly everywhere.
So it's been very helpful. And what we continue to see in Q1, again, is the smaller, the midsize and the large centers are all growing, and that's partly why we're able to have such a strong quarter for high-risk PCI."

Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we made progress on advancing our innovation, expanding clinical evidence and leveraging our premier commercial field team in a challenging environment with COVID and hospital staffing shortages. In Q2, Abiomed delivered $248 million of revenue, up 18% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in the U.S. and record revenues in Europe and Japan, up 24% and 19%, respectively. The growth was driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our U.S. surgical business. We believe Delta and hospital labor shortages had regional impacts beginning in August and continuing into September. As a result, only 75% of our U.S. regions grew year-over-year. For the 25% of the regions negatively impacted, we believe, based on prior experience, we will see recovery in those regions in the future.
In Q2, the shortage of hospital staff, especially nursing, was a new dynamic that we had not experienced during the COVID pandemic. As a result, the Q2 revenue missed our internal July expectations. Overall, hospitals today are managing the treatment of the pandemic better, but Impella usage in the cath lab is still impacted by ICU capacity limitations. Hospital staffing shortages in the U.S. caused some health systems to reduce cardiac procedures or temporarily closed facilities. Despite these headwinds faced within the quarter, the majority of U.S. regions remained resilient and recorded growth.
In Q2, we adapted within the quarter, by leveraging our Abiomed 2.0 playbook, which included monitoring specific trends on new COVID cases and hospital ICU capacity. This gave us the ability to adapt quickly to support high-risk or emergent patients, assist in patient transfer from spoke to hub, or support the ICU and patients with an Abiomed representative bedside or on the phone with Impella Connect.
Operationally, we achieved a 24% operating margin while investing a record level of $41 million in research and development to continue to advance our pipeline of life-saving devices. Our balance sheet remains robust with $862 million in cash and 0 debt, and our patent portfolio continues to gain strength with 1,297 patents and over 1,100 patents pending. We believe Abiomed has 1 of the strongest IP portfolios in the medical device industry, and we will add to it as we continue to innovate.
On today's call, I will highlight advances in innovation, progress on regulatory approvals, and how Abiomed's premier field team is providing heart hospital teams breakthrough technology, landmark clinical studies and 24/7 support during a challenging time. At Abiomed, leading in technology and innovation is 1 of our 4 principles. During the quarter, we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the FDA PMA approval for the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist. This is our minimally invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons with direct or axillary implantation in less than 60 minutes. This game-changing technology has enabled minimally invasive implantation with ambulation for more than 3,000 patients in the U.S. and has achieved greater than a 70% survival in a very sick, cardiogenic shock patient population.
As a result, in Q2, U.S. Surgical revenue grew 60% year-over-year. Today, Impella 5.5 is in 27% of U.S. heart hospitals or 306 of the 1,113 hospitals. Furthermore, we are eager to bring this technology to Japan, and have already applied for PMDA approval. We believe the Japanese market is ideal for Impella 5.5 given its ability to provide minimally invasive, longer-term, unloading support, enabling native heart recovery in a country culturally adverse to heart transplants and invasive sternotomies. We expect to receive Japanese PMDA approval for Impella 5.5 by this April 2022.
In Q2, we also expanded our Abiomed Breethe Oxy-1 System to a total of 7 U.S. sites and have treated 53 patients, which concludes Phase II of our pilot site product launch. The clinical feedback, primarily from heart surgeons on this compact cardiopulmonary bypass system, has been positive based on the ease of use with a simple, intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for patient ambulation. We will continue introducing this device at a measured pace and bring our disciplined approach to clinical data and innovation to the ECMO space.
On the regulatory front, we achieved multiple milestones. First, we launched Impella RP with SmartAssist at 4 sites and treated patients within the quarter. This smart pump is the next generation of our FDA-approved right heart device with a sensor and exclusive weaning capability. We also continue to make progress on the Impella RP with insertion through the internal jugular vein or IJ in the neck, as compared to the femoral vein in the leg. This is the preferred placement for heart surgeon -- heart surgeons and allows for early patient ambulation. We expect to file an Impella RP PMA supplement at the end of the fiscal year.
Second, in August, the FDA granted breakthrough device designation to Impella ECP. This designation means the FDA will prioritize Impella's ECP regulatory review processes including design iterations, clinical study protocols and PMA application. To date, we have enrolled 26 patients in the pilot EFS study at 4 hospitals. Based on the interaction with the FDA, we believe the high-risk PCI pivotal study will require a single arm with up to 225 Impella ECP patients at approximately 30 sites. We expect to lock in these details this quarter and enroll our first pivotal ECP patient in March and April, around the same time as our first Impella BTR patient in our FDA early feasibility study.
Moving to my last highlight, Abiomed's premier commercial team has positioned us as the leading heart recovery company, validated with our breakthrough technology landmark clinical studies, and 24/7 clinical support. We are also actively engaging the referring community with our direct-to-patient initiative and hub-and-spoke model to bring awareness and treatment options to this underserved cardiac disease, high-risk patient population. Our Impella Connect remote monitoring and 24/7 support has been valuable to the healthcare providers during the COVID-19 resurgence and nurse labor shortages, because we assist with patient management as ICUs become strained.
Impella Connect software is now live at more than 85% of our U.S. sites, allowing for the majority of our U.S. patients on support to be monitored in the cloud by the field, the call center or the customer. Outside of the U.S., our Impella Connect software is now live at 37% of our Japanese sites and 14% of our European sites. Today, no other company in this space offers this level of support and expertise.
Before I share a patient story, I want to remind listeners that 15 million Americans live with cardiac disease and it is the #1 cause of death in the U.S. with 875,000 deaths per year. Additionally, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women.
Now our Impella patient Frannie Argulis ,61, is a mother, grandmother and nursing supervisor from Henrico, Virginia. Earlier in the year, Frannie experienced jaw pain then collapsed at home. Frannie's husband called 911 and the paramedics transported her to where she works at St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. The cardiologists remove blood clots in the cath lab and placed a stent in Frannie's right coronary artery. During the procedure, she went into cardiogenic shock and the cardiologists, Dr. Darren Appleton and Dr. Peter Rowe inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist to support her left ventricle. While on support, SmartAssist technology triggered suction alarms, alerting physicians to check for right heart failure. Further testing confirmed right ventricular failure and the physicians inserted Impella RP to provide biventricular support.
After 1 day, Frannie's left ventricle function improved and Impella CP was removed. 7 days later, Impella RP was weaned and removed and 3 days later, Frannie returned home. Today, Frannie has normal heart function with an EF of 55% and is back to work as a nursing supervisor and living an active lifestyle with her grandchildren. As a heart recovery patient, her insurer, Medical Mutual, will avoid paying for the most expensive and invasive lifetime procedures that come with LVADs and heart transplant.
In conclusion, in Q2, we made progress on product innovation and regulatory milestones, while leveraging our commercial field team and the Abiomed 2.0 playbook in a challenging environment. Abiomed remains focused on disciplined execution and sustainable growth as we continue to pursue our goal of becoming the global standard of care to recover hearts and save lives.
To our employees and customers, you are the best in the industry. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to putting patients first. And to our shareholders, thank you for your continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $248 million, an increase of 18% versus prior year. Despite the challenges of the Delta variant and hospital labor shortages, we delivered double-digit growth across all geographies with record revenues in Europe and Japan. By region, the U.S. reported revenue of $200 million, up 16% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our Surgical business. U.S. patient utilization increased 8% year-over-year, with growth in high-risk PCI and double-digit growth in cardiogenic shock. As Mike mentioned, we believe Delta and labor shortages had a more significant impact on patient utilization within the quarter, which caused us to miss our internal goal.
We will continue to leverage our Abiomed 2.0 playbook to adapt in this environment and assist the hospital's ICUs. Our product penetration continues to drive adoption and revenue growth. As a reminder to investors, all of the following details on product installed base is summarized in our quarterly slide deck. In the U.S., at the end of September, the Impella 2.5 and CP have reached 1,549 sites. The Impella 5.0 has been placed in 666 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 306 sites, up 49 sites versus prior quarter. The full market release of the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform well, with U.S. revenue growing 116% year-over-year.
Finally, the Impella RP is in 634 sites. In the quarter, the reorder rate was 102%, slightly above prior year. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.8 units per site, slightly above the inventory levels we saw last quarter. We continue to see a favorable impact on revenue from sales mix in the U.S., resulting in about 4 points of growth.
Outside the U.S., we delivered record revenue of $48 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our European revenue increased 28% to $33 million versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization, sales mix and timing of orders. However, Germany was slightly impacted by extended physician vacations, combined with nursing shortages in select areas. Despite these headwinds, our European business delivered record revenue in our second quarter. In Japan, we also delivered a record revenue quarter of $12 million, up 19% year-over-year. Impella utilization remained strong, up 33% versus prior year despite headwinds from a COVID resurgence and the Summer Olympics. Within the quarter, we opened 9 new sites, bringing our total sites to 180 out of a potential 350 hospitals.
Moving to key financial metrics. Gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter compared to 81.5% in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by sales mix and higher production volumes. In the second quarter, R&D expense totaled $41 million, an increase of 34% versus prior year. Year-over-year growth was driven by investments in small board devices like Impella ECP and XR Sheath. Future heart failure technologies such as preCARDIA and Impella BTR and STEMI DTU and PROTECT IV randomized controlled trials.
SG&A expense for the second quarter totaled $103 million, up 30% versus prior year, driven by investments in our direct-to-patient initiative, customer training and additions to our premier distribution team. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating income was $60 million, down 1% versus prior year, translating to an operating margin of 24.4%. This reflects growth investments tied to our continued focus on extending our lead with innovation, advancing clinical evidence and further enhancing our distribution team. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $47 million or $1.03 per diluted share versus $46 million or $1.01 in Q2 of '21. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest income and a lower effective tax rate.
We had another solid quarter on cash, as we generated $61 million of operating cash flow. Our balance sheet is robust as we ended the quarter with $862 million of cash in marketable securities.
Now turning to our outlook. With the impact of the pandemic and new challenges with hospital staffing shortages, uncertain conditions remain. In order to provide full transparency to our investors, we want to give insight on our revenue expectations for the second half of the year. The Delta variant and hospital labor shortages in the U.S. impacted August, September and continues to put pressure on Impella procedural volumes in October. Abiomed started the fiscal year with a range of $990 million to $1.03 billion with growth of 17% to 22% versus the prior year. After a record Q1 and a solid July, we upgraded our guidance to $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, with growth of 22% to 24%.
Given our current visibility to October, which appears to be trending towards approximately high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, we expect Q3 global revenue to be slightly up from Q2. This assumes some improvement in Delta rates and hospital staffing in November and December. We now expect fiscal year '22 revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, an increase of 19% to 22% versus prior year and slightly above our original fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 24% to 25%.
In summary, while we navigate through the uncertainties, we remain focused on investing in innovation and clinical research and operational execution to achieve our fiscal year '22 goals. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for Abiomed as we continue to improve outcomes, recover hearts and save lives.

So we have a playbook to adapt to Delta. What was new is a little bit of the shortages of staffing. So the procedures want to be done. The physicians are engaged, but they don't have the surgical techs or the cath lab techs or ICU capacity that limits use. So that impacted about 25%. If we look at our -- just the same metric for cardiogenic shock, 83% of our regions grew. So we're a little more resilient and that plays to our ability to be relevant and help the patients and also help the ICU and the nurses there with training, with support, with online CMEs and anything else that we can do bedside.
If I think about the next part of the year, I think we've got the Delta variant somewhat managed as the hospitals know how to do this better. They're just assuming they're going to continue to have beds allocated for for Delta. And don't forget that we treat some of those most severe sick Delta patients with our emergency use authorization for the RP or ECMO, VV ECMO, which is the majority of our Breethe patients or ECPELLA. So we're still there providing support.
On the shortages, I think what's going to happen is it's going to be incremental. They're going to continue to prioritize the sickest of the sick patients, which is some of -- or most of our patients. And I think the hospitals are resilient, but they're going to need help. And that's where the Abiomed field team, Impella Connect, IQ database, and the training as well as the networking between the hub and spoke and transfer will be helpful."

So that's currently impacting less than 20% of our hospitals and we do think that comes back, and we have seen that come back. So I think as time goes on, that will get minimized. I also think it's an opportunity for Abiomed, because of our field team, our clinical expertise, our bedside support, call center and Impella Connect, that we can help augment what they're doing and assist them in that shortage. And I think it's going to get better. And I think hospitals are more resilient now. So we see this as something that will allow us to continue to grow, and we're well positioned as they continue to train new nurses and we'll probably be part of that process.
On the XR Sheath, nothing has changed relative to our prior. As you heard on the call, we have a list of new products and new approvals. So we're trying to prioritize for the call here, what are the biggest ones or the most important ones and ones that are happening in the next 6 months. So ECP is a great progress. I think it's ahead of schedule from everything we've been stating. We announced today that we expect to have the 5.5 approved in Japan by April, which is -- hadn't been commented on. And I think the 5.5 is going to be a breakthrough product in Japan, because of the culture there and the aversion to sternotomies and heart transplant.
The BTR pump is there's -- it's a minimally invasive dischargeable LVAD. There's nothing like it in the world. It's what physicians and surgeons have wanted for 10 years. And we expect to be doing patients first in here in the U.S. through the early feasibility in March and April. We haven't commented about the PreCardia, but that continues with the EFS, and we're looking forward to going to Phase III on the ECMO.
So with all of that technology, we have to continue to execute, control what we control. And it just points to the fact that we are the leaders now for the heart team. Essentially, every single heart team out there is working with Abiomed on a product in the cath lab, the surgical suite or the ICU or in the cloud. And we have the landmark clinical studies to back up the data as well. So we're excited for that. And I think we're going to continue to see more momentum. And whatever happens in the future, we'll be well positioned and will support our hospitals."

We think some of the headwinds from Delta sort of subside over the next 2 months, but that's the expectation as we get into Q3.
And as I look at Q4, when we look at the low end of the range, I think we assume that as a business continues to recover, and we see a modest or gradual lift from Q3 to Q4. Again, as Delta cases improve and hospitals are able to manage -- I'd say, manage better their labor shortages, which are reducing some of the limitations on ICU capacity.

So starting with Breethe, we have been tracking all the patients. The ECMO space is interesting, because it does not require any clinical data. It's a 510(k) clearance only. And so we are approaching that space as a PMA company. We're looking and collecting the data as a PMA company. We're looking for best practices. What we recently did in Europe is we did our first patient under an ECPELLA software, where we're combining the software so you can optimize and the systems talk to each other and you can wean that patient, and know what's happening as you unload the heart and also perfuse and oxygenate the body.
So there's some really amazing things that we're going to be able to do currently and also some things we're going to do in the future with AI. Also, what we're starting to work on, we've done our first patient where we have Impella Connect running from a helicopter and a lot of ambulances are starting to connect with WiFi. So we're putting Impella Connect on the ECMO device. So whether you're ECMO only Impella or ECPELLA, we'll be able to transmit that data into the cloud. And whether the person is being -- is at a hospital or being transferred on an ambulance or in a helicopter, that will be an exclusive feature. And we're excited to bring all this innovation and knowledge and clinical expertise to that space.
For the 5.5, it's just -- it is a breakthrough product. I mean you have the ability to have a full VAD. So I've been in this space 18 years. And what the heart surgeons always wanted was a minimally invasive weanable VAD. And with the Impella, you get that. And the fact that it's forward flow means that as the pump is working, it's resting the heart. But as you want to reload the heart, as you turn it down, it allows the heart to naturally start to pump with sensors on the device that we can see how the heart is recovering. And it's really revolutionary, because it's -- all the other VADs and ECMO devices are essentially dumb devices. You put them in and you really don't have any way of knowing how the heart is doing.
And what's most important for these patients is you get survival with native heart recovery, because survival is the low bar. And even if you survive, many of these papers don't even give heart recovery numbers and these patients end up in hospice care or maybe even those that are lucky, they can get a transplant. So the amount of information we're doing around recovery will be accelerated in Japan where they believe in stem cell. They've been -- they've had advanced publications in science of hemodynamic unloading and pressure volume loops. And we think it will be material be a revolutionary treatment and it will be in a country that really focuses on heart recovery more than anything else, and we're super excited to bring that product to Japan."

We hadn't yet seen a little bit of the August impact, starting with maybe some extended vacations, Delta ramp and then also shortages that are out there in staff.
So I think what happened is in July, it hit in August. August was a little bit down and that carried into September. You're also right that we usually do see the summer quarter dip a little bit. Usually, that dip is in patients, where we go a little down or flat. But we tend to open more centers, do more training. And we do have a lot of new products that we're opening in -- that we've already mentioned. So that's where we expected to see a higher number than we achieved. It is the third highest quarter we've ever done in revenue and patients, but we thought we were going to do better.
And I think what we're trying to give you transparency to is that the model of the 47% to 53% is just probably not going to be a perfect model this year, because of not just COVID, but some of the shortages. But as we're working through the shortages and as I think the hospitals are responding, I think we're going to end up getting back to where we were in the good old days and have just an incredible strong second half of the fiscal year."

Unfortunately, the patients that we treat are really sick. So that's bad for the patient and the hospital, but what that does is that starts to take the beds and an extended stay will take out a lot of our Protected PCI patient availability. And that's where the hub and spoke and moving patients around is helpful. So if something happens in the spoke Hospital, we might help with getting that patient transferred to a bigger hub hospital. What we also saw, when we track small, medium and large hospitals, is the trend in September was the medium hospitals tended to be more impacted. And while we saw the growth happen year-over-year and especially in shock, those medium-sized users of ours were impacted a little more. Maybe they weren't as resilient with their protocols or maybe they were more impacted by the nursing shortages or the facilities were minimized, but I think as we look at the total picture, the cardiogenic shock patients, whether they have COVID or not, that's what's happening. And when you think of myocarditis shock or COVID, you're talking about problems with the lungs, the heart and the kidneys, and that's what our products are designed to do, and that's what our products are FDA approved for.
So we continue to look at this as just a broader heart failure population and specifically to COVID, you've seen the majority of these patients getting ECMO where they do VV ECMO, where it's pure oxygenation, not necessarily heart support. But that's a great question."

I'm sure COVID is probably a little bit worse than you expected here in the quarter and likely for the rest of the year. So it seems like the $20 million reduction, maybe, I don't know, $12 million of that is COVID related, maybe somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range is is staffing shortage related for the back half of the year. So is that a reasonable assessment of what's kind of going on here? And then with this kind of $5 million to $10 million for half of the year impact from a shortage perspective, are hospitals able to adjust here heading into fiscal '23 to offset what's a $10 million to $20 million headwind on the staffing shortage side?

So let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and I tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings.

So let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and I tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings. But again, as you said here and we got through our first quarter, right? Our first quarter was a record quarter for Abiomed on both revenue as well as patients, right? And then we got into July, and we had, I would say, a really solid July, both from a normal seasonality perspective, and expectations on both revenue and patients. And so if you just look at our annualized, our Q1 performance, at that time, you get to over $1.01 billion. And then as Mike mentioned, right, we typically have normal seasonality, right? So it's typically 47% first half, 53% second half, and that came into our process.
So after the first 4 months, of the year, we felt actually really good about the revised range of $1.03 to $1.05 at that time. And then the Delta surge impacted us in the month of August. And it really hit some of our larger markets, i.e., Florida and Texas as well as some of the other regions in the Southeast. And then what was new for us in August was this dynamic of hospital labor shortages. And so we did not encounter that headwind in the previous pandemic -- in a previous pandemic. And so I think the labor shortages are temporary, but they have been putting more pressure on procedural volumes across the U.S. And I think these 2 headwinds, as I mentioned, really impacted August to September performance and caused us to miss our internal forecast by, I'd say, that $5 million to $7 million range.
With that said, we did still deliver 18% growth versus prior year. And as a reminder, we did have positive growth in Q2 quarter of last year. So I think it was -- we thought it was prudent to really update our guidance at this point in time to $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, which again was slightly above our initial guidance. And again, all we're trying to do is be as transparent with you as we can during these uneven times."

Let me start with our customers and our trialists are totally passionate and committed to these studies. And while other companies are not doing studies or put them on pause, we have multiple RCTs and post-approval studies running. So we did do 18 patients on PROTECT IV. We now have -- I'm going to give you up-to-date numbers. We have 24 randomized patients in P4. We have 28 in the registry for that protocol, and we have 18 sites that are fully enrolling up and, up and running. So that's pretty impressive in the quarter with everything we just went through on Delta and shortages.
On STEMI, we are -- we did it over 10 patients in the quarter. We have 36 sites that are enrolling, and we're at 99 patients. We're going to have a 100-patient recognition here, and that continues to move. So we're excited about that.
The last component of your question, I believe, was the ECP. And we are going to make it a priority. We're going to -- with the sites that are there. We're going to have them enroll and the fact that we'll have a 9 French device, means the peripheral vascular disease and many of these other things that might cause certain challenges, it will cast a wide net and we're going to ask the centers that are in that study to prioritize and go efficiently, but there is tremendous demand and excitement for that product as well.
So the 1 thing, regardless of what's happening, our job is to continue to adapt and execute. We have taken advantage of the internal things we can control, whether it's innovation or the clinical research, and we feel that nothing stops innovation. So as we continue to innovate and improve outcomes for patients, we're incredibly confident in the time lines that are out there for new products in these clinical studies."

I think your -- it's a very insightful question, because you're recognizing what we've been investing in is to provide a level of support that doesn't exist in the industry, whether it's bedside or in the cloud or capturing the data, or even training nurses. So as the nurses that are coming into the ICU, they're newer, we can work with them, we can do hands-on training, they can go online and do CME training, and we can coordinate specialized care. So we continue to do that.
I just want to be clear, though, that the Delta variant had the massive impact and what made it more complicated for us and the playbook was the labor shortages that did not impact 75% of our sites. The impact was more of 25% of our sites. And for shock, it impacted less than that 17%. So I think that what we're doing is we're whittling away at it, and we're trying to minimize it with exactly what you're talking about with our bedside support with our SmartAssist. It makes managing the patient easier with Impella Connect, putting that in the cloud, so that our experts, our nurses, our call center and our local people as well as the physicians can review that patient without being bedside and then quantitatively put numbers on it and track it.
So I think all the things that you -- we've mentioned and you're pointing to, that does give us an advantage and allows the hospital to benefit from our services, and that's where this network approach, our ability to have the premier field team is really coming into play, and I think will continue to help us drive positive growth."

And again, on all of these studies, as you get into the pivotals, you are -- it's a controlled study, but you are generating revenue. The hospitals are getting DRG payment. And in our own space, this is kind of how we launch anyhow.
We go slow and steady, because it's so important to learn to get great outcomes. And I kind of see it as somewhat of a preclinical launch, but it puts this technology into the hands of these U.S. physicians, and it really helps drive this heart team approach.

One is a physician that's struggling with a 14 French hole just on the Impella, which is a 9-French catheter. That's something that ECMO is 17 to 19 French large tubes all the way through. So there's definitely an intimidation and an issue there with bleeding in ECMO, that's in the literature as well as inflammatory response and risk of stroke.
Relative to the overall process, I think it's good, because people are learning about mechanical circulatory support. People are thinking quicker about how do I get to that support. There's been a publication that talks about the centers that have shock teams. They do a better job of getting better outcomes. They technically talked about it, they use less and what they mean less, they're using less probably escalation of inotropes and just balloon pumps, and they're moving quicker to the best practices of pre PCI in shock or escalating, looking for right heart failure or using ECMO or ECPELLA where you need oxygenation.
So I think that's all been very positive. And again, on COVID, the majority of those patients are VV ECMO. And so I think there's also some education that's been happening around just the oxygenation and the need for oxygenation versus cardiac support. So it's all been positive.

I mean we've talked about an additional 100,000 patients that we are looking to support as a combination between Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. And that is a very conservative number out of the 1.6 million Class III and 400,000 Class IV patients that are looking to have the ability to feel better and also potentially get better. And that's a subset of what we would call the acute on chronic heart failure patients. Those are also the patients that are, I think, the second highest admission into the hospital. To some extent, we're going to start treating those patients earlier with preCARDIA, which is a preload reduction device that can be put in, in the ICU with the heart failure cardiologists. And for those that get worse, they may go on to 5.5. And for those that are just going to require longer-term support, the Impella BTR is not FDA approved, but that is the intent to go through the study to then utilize this technology for those patients as well.
The LVAD technology is vastly improved over the years. However, it still requires a sternotomy and coring out of the left ventricle, and it doesn't provide forward flow. So in some cases, the valves are sewn shut. And what we're trying to do is give that patient and that physician full support with a minimally invasive axillary implant through the shoulder, allow the patient to get up and walk around and it on many options of recovery and other therapies that they can utilize."

And we're not necessarily looking at it as a single product. We're looking at it as a way to solidify our partnership with the hospital and bringing the heart team together, because those surgeons also do high-risk CABG, where they potentially need support. And those surgeons in some cases, turn down patients that then get referred over for PCI.
One example is at Cleveland Clinic in their protocol, if you're an acute on chronic patient, so the patients I just talked about, you have worn out heart, you have advanced coronary disease and you decompensate. At that facility, they're likely going to stabilize you with a 5.5, then they're going to do an evaluation of what treatment they're going to do. And some of those patients go to the cath lab with the 5.5, some of those patients go to the EP lab with the 5.5 and some of those patients go on to CABG. And so it's really designing a protocol that allows for the ability to stabilize the patient, protect the heart and the kidneys, and then bring whatever treatment adjunctive therapies that's in the best interest of that patient.

During the second quarter, we made progress on advancing our innovation, expanding clinical evidence and leveraging our premier commercial field team in a challenging environment with COVID and hospital staffing sho",1435,"Thanks, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we made progress on advancing our innovation, expanding clinical evidence and leveraging our premier commercial field team in a challenging environment with COVID and hospital staffing shortages. In Q2, Abiomed delivered $248 million of revenue, up 18% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in the U.S. and record revenues in Europe and Japan, up 24% and 19%, respectively. The growth was driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our U.S. surgical business. We believe Delta and hospital labor shortages had regional impacts beginning in August and continuing into September. As a result, only 75% of our U.S. regions grew year-over-year. For the 25% of the regions negatively impacted, we believe, based on prior experience, we will see recovery in those regions in the future.
In Q2, the shortage of hospital staff, especially nursing, was a new dynamic that we had not experienced during the COVID pandemic. As a result, the Q2 revenue missed our internal July expectations. Overall, hospitals today are managing the treatment of the pandemic better, but Impella usage in the cath lab is still impacted by ICU capacity limitations. Hospital staffing shortages in the U.S. caused some health systems to reduce cardiac procedures or temporarily close facilities. Despite these headwinds faced within the quarter, the majority of U.S. regions remained resilient and recorded growth.
In Q2, we adapted within the quarter, by leveraging our Abiomed 2.0 playbook, which included monitoring specific trends on new COVID cases and hospital ICU capacity. This gave us the ability to adapt quickly to support high-risk or emergent patients, assist in patient transfer from spoke to hub, or support the ICU and patient with an Abiomed representative bedside or on the phone with Impella Connect.
Operationally, we achieved a 24% operating margin while investing a record level of $41 million in research and development to continue to advance our pipeline of life-saving devices. Our balance sheet remains robust with $862 million in cash and 0 debt, and our patent portfolio continues to gain strength with 1,297 patents and over 1,100 patents pending. We believe Abiomed has 1 of the strongest IP portfolios in the medical device industry, and we will add to it as we continue to innovate.
On today's call, I will highlight advances in innovation, progress on regulatory approvals, and how Abiomed's premier field team is providing heart hospital teams breakthrough technology, landmark clinical studies and 24/7 support during a challenging time. At Abiomed, leading in technology and innovation is 1 of our 4 principles. During the quarter, we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the FDA PMA approval for the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist. This is our minimally invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons with direct or axillary implantation in less than 60 minutes. This game-changing technology has enabled minimally invasive implantation with ambulation for more than 3,000 patients in the U.S. and has achieved greater than a 70% survival in a very sick, cardiogenic shock patient population.
As a result, in Q2, U.S. Surgical revenue grew 60% year-over-year. Today, Impella 5.5 is in 27% of U.S. heart hospitals or 306 of the 1,113 hospitals. Furthermore, we are eager to bring this technology to Japan, and have already applied for PMDA approval. We believe the Japanese market is ideal for Impella 5.5 given its ability to provide minimally invasive, longer-term, unloading support, enabling native heart recovery in a country culturally averse to heart transplants and invasive sternotomies. We expect to receive Japanese PMDA approval for Impella 5.5 by this April 2022. 
In Q2, we also expanded our Abiomed Breethe OXY-1 System to a total of 7 U.S. sites and have treated 53 patients, which concludes Phase II of our pilot site product launch. The clinical feedback, primarily from heart surgeons on this compact cardiopulmonary bypass system, has been positive based on the ease of use with a simple, intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for patient ambulation. We will continue introducing this device at a measured pace and bring our disciplined approach to clinical data and innovation to the ECMO space.
On the regulatory front, we achieved multiple milestones. First, we launched Impella RP with SmartAssist at 4 sites and treated patients within the quarter. This smart pump is the next generation of our FDA-approved right heart device with a sensor and exclusive weaning capability. We also continue to make progress on the Impella RP with insertion through the internal jugular vein or IJ in the neck, as compared to the femoral vein in the leg. This is the preferred placement for heart surgeon -- heart surgeons and allows for early patient ambulation. We expect to file an Impella RP PMA supplement at the end of the fiscal year.
Second, in August, the FDA granted breakthrough device designation to Impella ECP. This designation means the FDA will prioritize Impella's ECP regulatory review processes including design iterations, clinical study protocols and PMA application. To date, we have enrolled 26 patients in the pilot EFS study at 4 hospitals. Based on the interaction with the FDA, we believe the high-risk PCI pivotal study will require a single arm with up to 225 Impella ECP patients at approximately 30 sites. We expect to lock in these details this quarter and enroll our first pivotal ECP patient in March and April, around the same time as our first Impella BTR patient in our FDA early feasibility study.
Moving to my last highlight, Abiomed's premier commercial team has positioned us as the leading heart recovery company, validated with our breakthrough technology landmark clinical studies, and 24/7 clinical support. We are also actively engaging the referring community with our direct-to-patient initiative and hub-and-spoke model to bring awareness and treatment options to this underserved cardiac disease, high-risk patient population. Our Impella Connect remote monitoring and 24/7 support has been valuable to the healthcare providers during the COVID-19 resurgence and nurse labor shortages, because we assist with patient management as ICUs become strained.
Impella Connect software is now live at more than 85% of our U.S. sites, allowing for the majority of our U.S. patients on support to be monitored in the cloud by the field, the call center or the customer. Outside of the U.S., our Impella Connect software is now live at 37% of our Japanese sites and 14% of our European sites. Today, no other company in this space offers this level of support and expertise.
Before I share a patient story, I want to remind listeners that 15 million Americans live with cardiac disease and it is the #1 cause of death in the U.S. with 875,000 deaths per year. Additionally, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women.
Now our Impella patient Frannie Argulis, 61, is a mother, grandmother and nursing supervisor from Henrico, Virginia. Earlier in the year, Frannie experienced jaw pain then collapsed at home. Frannie's husband called 911 and the paramedics transported her to where she works at St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. The cardiologists remove blood clots in the cath lab and placed a stent in Frannie's right coronary artery. During the procedure, she went into cardiogenic shock and the cardiologists, Dr. Darren Appleton and Dr. Peter Rowe inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist to support her left ventricle. While on support, SmartAssist technology triggered suction alarms, alerting physicians to check for right heart failure. Further testing confirmed right ventricular failure and the physicians inserted Impella RP to provide biventricular support.
After 1 day, Frannie's left ventricle function improved and Impella CP was removed. 7 days later, Impella RP was weaned and removed and 3 days later, Frannie returned home. Today, Frannie has normal heart function with an EF of 55% and is back to work as a nursing supervisor and living an active lifestyle with her grandchildren. As a heart recovery patient, her insurer, Medical Mutual, will avoid paying for the most expensive and invasive lifetime procedures that come with LVADs and heart transplant.
In conclusion, in Q2, we made progress on product innovation and regulatory milestones, while leveraging our commercial field team and the Abiomed 2.0 playbook in a challenging environment. Abiomed remains focused on disciplined execution and sustainable growth as we continue to pursue our goal of becoming the global standard of care to recover hearts and save lives.
To our employees and customers, you are the best in the industry. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to putting patients first. And to our shareholders, thank you for your continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $248 million, an increase of 18% versus prior year. Despite the challenges of the Delta variant and hospital labor shortages, we delivered double-digit growth across all geographies with record revenues in Europe and Japan. By region, the U.S. reported revenue of $200 million, up 16% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our Surgical business. U.S. patient utilization increased 8% year-over-year, with growth in high-risk PCI and double-digit growth in cardiogenic shock. As Mike mentioned, we believe Delta and labor shortages had a more significant impact on patient utilization within the quarter, which caused us to miss our internal goal.
We will continue to leverage our Abiomed 2.0 playbook to adapt in this environment and assist the hospital's ICUs. Our product penetration continues to drive adoption and revenue growth. As a reminder to investors, all of the following details on product installed base is summarized in our quarterly slide deck. In the U.S., at the end of September, the Impella 2.5 and CP have reached 1,549 sites. The Impella 5.0 has been placed in 666 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 306 sites, up 49 sites versus prior quarter. The full market release of the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform well, with U.S. revenue growing 116% year-over-year.
Finally, the Impella RP is in 634 sites. In the quarter, the reorder rate was 102%, slightly above prior year. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.8 units per site, slightly above the inventory levels we saw last quarter. We continue to see a favorable impact on revenue from sales mix in the U.S., resulting in about 4 points of growth.
Outside the U.S., we delivered record revenue of $48 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our European revenue increased 28% to $33 million versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization, sales mix and timing of orders. However, Germany was slightly impacted by extended physician vacations, combined with nursing shortages in select areas. Despite these headwinds, our European business delivered record revenue in our second quarter. In Japan, we also delivered a record revenue quarter of $12 million, up 19% year-over-year. Impella utilization remained strong, up 33% versus prior year despite headwinds from a COVID resurgence in the Summer Olympics.
Within the quarter, we opened 9 new sites, bringing our total sites to 180 out of a potential 350 hospitals.
Moving to key financial metrics. Gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter compared to 81.5% in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by sales mix and higher production volumes. In the second quarter, R&D expense totaled $41 million, an increase of 34% versus prior year. Year-over-year growth was driven by investments in small board devices like Impella ECP and XR Sheath. Future heart failure technologies such as preCARDIA and Impella BTR and STEMI DTU and PROTECT IV randomized controlled trials.
SG&A expense for the second quarter totaled $103 million, up 30% versus prior year, driven by investments in our direct-to-patient initiative, customer training and additions to our premier distribution team. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating income was $60 million, down 1% versus prior year, translating to an operating margin of 24.4%. This reflects growth investments tied to our continued focus on extending our lead with innovation, advancing clinical evidence and further enhancing our distribution team. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $47 million or $1.03 per diluted share versus $46 million or $1.01 in Q2 of '21. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest income and a lower effective tax rate.
We had another solid quarter on cash, as we generated $61 million of operating cash flow. Our balance sheet is robust as we ended the quarter with $862 million of cash in marketable securities.
Now turning to our outlook. With the impact of the pandemic and new challenges with hospital staffing shortages, uncertain conditions remain. In order to provide full transparency to our investors, we want to give insight on our revenue expectations for the second half of the year. The Delta variant and hospital labor shortages in the U.S. impacted August, September and continues to put pressure on Impella procedural volumes in October. Abiomed started the fiscal year with a range of $990 million to $1.03 billion with growth of 17% to 22% versus the prior year. After a record Q1 and a solid July, we upgraded our guidance to $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, with growth of 22% to 24%.
Given our current visibility to October, which appears to be trending towards approximately high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, we expect Q3 global revenue to be slightly up from Q2. This assumes some improvement in Delta rates and hospital staffing in November and December. We now expect fiscal year '22 revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, an increase of 19% to 22% versus prior year and slightly above our original fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 24% to 25%.
In summary, while we navigate through the uncertainties, we remain focused on investing in innovation and clinical research and operational execution to achieve our fiscal year '22 goals. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for Abiomed as we continue to improve outcomes, recover hearts and save lives.

So we have a playbook to adapt to Delta. What was new is a little bit of the shortages of staffing. So the procedures want to be done. The physicians are engaged, but they don't have the surgical techs or the cath lab techs or ICU capacity that limits use. So that impacted about 25%. If we look at our -- just the same metric for cardiogenic shock, 83% of our regions grew. So we're a little more resilient and that plays to our ability to be relevant and help the patients and also help the ICU and the nurses there with training, with support, with online CMEs and anything else that we can do bedside.
If I think about the next part of the year, I think we've got the Delta variant somewhat managed as the hospitals know how to do this better. They're just assuming they're going to continue to have beds allocated for Delta. And don't forget that we treat some of those most severe sick Delta patients with our emergency use authorization for the RP or ECMO, V-V ECMO, which is the majority of our Breethe patients or ECpella. So we're still there providing support.
On the shortages, I think what's going to happen is it's going to be incremental. They're going to continue to prioritize the sickest of the sick patients, which is some of -- or most of our patients. And I think the hospitals are resilient, but they're going to need help.

So remember, the -- it's the Delta variant with ICU capacity and the nursing shortages. So that's currently impacting less than 20% of our hospitals and we do think that comes back, and we have seen that come back. So I think as time goes on, that will get minimized. I also think it's an opportunity for Abiomed, because of our field team, our clinical expertise, our bedside support, call center and Impella Connect, that we can help augment what they're doing and assist them in that shortage. And I think it's going to get better. And I think hospitals are more resilient now. So we see this as something that will allow us to continue to grow, and we're well positioned as they continue to train new nurses and we'll probably part of that process.
On the XR Sheath, nothing has changed relative to our prior. As you heard on the call, we have a list of new products and new approvals. So we're trying to prioritize for the call here, what are the biggest ones or the most important ones and ones that are happening in the next 6 months. So ECP is a great progress. I think it's ahead of schedule from everything we've been stating. We announced today that we expect to have the 5.5 approved in Japan by April, which is -- hadn't been commented on. And I think the 5.5 is going to be a breakthrough product in Japan, because of the culture there and the aversion to sternotomies and heart transplant.
The BTR pump is there's -- it's a minimally invasive dischargeable LVAD. There's nothing like it in the world. It's what physicians and surgeons have wanted for 10 years. And we expect to be doing patients first in man here in the U.S. through the early feasibility in March and April. We haven't commented about the PreCARDIA, but that continues with the EFS, and we're looking forward to going to Phase III on the ECMO.
So with all of that technology, we have to continue to execute, control what we control. And it just points to the fact that we are the leaders now for the heart team. Essentially, every single heart team out there is working with Abiomed on a product, in the cath lab, the surgical suite or the ICU or in the cloud. And we have the landmark clinical studies to back up the data as well. So we're excited for that. And I think we're going to continue to see more momentum. And whatever happens in the future, we'll be well positioned and will support our hospitals."

We think some of the headwinds from Delta sort of subside over the next 2 months, but that's the expectation as we get into Q3.
And as I look at Q4, when we look at the low end of the range, I think we assume that as the business continues to recover, and we see a modest or gradual lift from Q3 to Q4. Again, as Delta cases improve and hospitals are able to manage -- I'd say, manage better their labor shortages, which are reducing some of the limitations on the ICU capacity.

So starting with Breethe, we have been tracking all the patients. The ECMO space is interesting, because it does not require any clinical data. It's a 510(k) clearance only. And so we are approaching that space as a PMA company. We're looking and collecting the data as a PMA company. We're looking for best practices. What we recently did in Europe is we did our first patient under an ECpella software, where we're combining the software so you can optimize and the systems talk to each other and you can wean that patient, and know what's happening as you unload the heart and also perfuse and oxygenate the body. 
So there's some really amazing things that we're going to be able to do currently and also some things we're going to do in the future with AI. Also, what we're starting to work on, we've done our first patient where we have Impella Connect running from a helicopter and a lot of ambulances are starting to connect with WiFi. So we're putting Impella Connect on the ECMO device. So whether you're ECMO only Impella or ECpella, we'll be able to transmit that data into the cloud. And whether the person is being -- is at a hospital or being transferred on an ambulance or in a helicopter, that will be an exclusive feature.
And we're excited to bring all this innovation and knowledge and clinical expertise to that space.
For the 5.5, it's just -- it is a breakthrough product. I mean you have the ability to have a full VAD. So I've been in this space 18 years. And what the heart surgeons always wanted was a minimally invasive weanable VAD. And with the Impella, you get that. And the fact that it's forward flow means that as the pump is working, it's resting the heart. But as you want to reload the heart, as you turn it down, it allows the heart to naturally start to pump with sensors on the device that we can see how the heart is recovering. And it's really revolutionary, because it's -- all the other VADs and ECMO devices are essentially dumb devices. You put them in and you really don't have any way of knowing how the heart is doing.
And what's most important for these patients is you get survival with native heart recovery, because survival is the low bar. And even if you survive, many of these papers don't even give heart recovery numbers and these patients end up in hospice care or maybe even those that are lucky, they can get a transplant. So the amount of information we're doing around recovery will be accelerated in Japan where they believe in stem cell. They've been -- they've had advanced publications in science of hemodynamic unloading and pressure volume loops. And we think it will be material, be a revolutionary treatment and it will be in a country that really focuses on heart recovery more than anything else, and we're super excited to bring that product to Japan."

And if you're looking at the numbers on the guidance, our normal 47%-53% puts us at a higher range. If you look at our guidance, we're essentially back to where we started the fiscal year, but we've lowered -- or we've increased the lower end of the range. So we started the fiscal year with 17% to 22%. We upgraded it to 22% to 24% after Q1, which was incredibly strong. And we had great momentum. We -- the playbook was working. We hadn't yet seen a little bit of the August impact, starting with maybe some extended vacations, Delta ramp and then also shortages that are out there in staff.
So I think what happened is in July, it hit in August. August was a little bit down and that carried into September. You're also right that we usually do see the summer quarter dip a little bit. Usually, that dip is in patients, where we go a little down or flat. But we tend to open more centers, do more training. And we do have a lot of new products that we're opening in -- that we've already mentioned. So that's where we expected to see a higher number than we achieved. It is the third highest quarter we've ever done in revenue and patients, but we thought we were going to do better.
And I think what we're trying to give you transparency to is that the model of the 47% to 53% is just probably not going to be a perfect model this year, because of not just COVID, but some of the shortages. But as we're working through the shortages and as I think the hospitals are responding, I think we're going to end up getting back to where we were in the good old days and have just an incredible strong second half of the fiscal year."

Unfortunately, the patients that we treat are really sick. So that's bad for the patient and the hospital, but what that does is that starts to take the beds and an extended stay will take out a lot of our Protected PCI patient availability. And that's where the hub and spoke and moving patients around is helpful. So if something happens in the spoke hospital, we might help with getting that patient transferred to a bigger hub hospital. What we also saw, when we track small, medium and large hospitals, is the trend in September was the medium hospitals tended to be more impacted.
And while we saw the growth happen year-over-year and especially in shock, those medium-sized users of ours were impacted a little more. Maybe they weren't as resilient with their protocols or maybe they were more impacted by the nursing shortages or the facilities were minimized, but I think as we look at the total picture, the cardiogenic shock patients, whether they have COVID or not, that's what's happening. And when you think of myocarditis shock or COVID, you're talking about problems with the lungs, the heart and the kidneys, and that's what our products are designed to do, and that's what our products are FDA approved for.
So we continue to look at this as just a broader heart failure population and specifically to COVID, you've seen the majority of these patients getting ECMO where they do V-V ECMO, where it's pure oxygenation, not necessarily heart support. But that's a great question."

So let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and I tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings. But again, as you said here and we got through our first quarter, right? Our first quarter was a record quarter for Abiomed on both revenue as well as patients, right? And then we got into July, and we had, I would say, a really solid July, both from a normal seasonality perspective, and expectations on both revenue and patients. And so if you just look at our annualized, our Q1 performance, at that time, you get to over $1.01 billion. And then as Mike mentioned, right, we typically have normal seasonality, right? So it's typically 47% first half, 53% second half, and that came into our process.
So after the first 4 months, of the year, we felt actually really good about the revised range of $1.03 to $1.05 at that time. And then the Delta surge impacted us in the month of August. And it really hit some of our larger markets, i.e., Florida and Texas as well as some of the other regions in the Southeast. And then what was new for us in August was this dynamic of hospital labor shortages. And so we did not encounter that headwind in the previous pandemic -- in a previous pandemic. And so I think the labor shortages are temporary, but they have been putting more pressure on procedural volumes across the U.S. And I think these 2 headwinds, as I mentioned, really impacted August and September performance and caused us to miss our internal forecast by, I'd say, that $5 million to $7 million range.
With that said, we did still deliver 18% growth versus prior year. And as a reminder, we did have positive growth in Q2 quarter of last year. So I think it was -- we thought it was prudent to really update our guidance at this point of time to $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, which again was slightly above our initial guidance.

Let me start with our customers and our trialists are totally passionate and committed to these studies. And while other companies are not doing studies or put them on pause, we have multiple RCTs and post-approval studies running. So we did do 18 patients on PROTECT IV. We now have -- I'm going to give you up-to-date numbers. We have 24 randomized patients in P4. We have 28 in the registry for that protocol, and we have 18 sites that are fully enrolling up and running. So that's pretty impressive in the quarter with everything we just went through on Delta and shortages.
On STEMI, we are -- we did it over 10 patients in the quarter. We have 36 sites that are enrolling, and we're at 99 patients. We're going to have a 100-patient recognition here, and that continues to move. So we're excited about that.
The last component of your question, I believe, was the ECP. And we are going to make it a priority. We're going to -- with the sites that are there. We're going to have them enroll and the fact that we'll have a 9 French device, means the peripheral vascular disease and many of these other things that might cause certain challenges, it will cast a wide net and we're going to ask the centers that are in that study to prioritize and to go efficiently, but there is tremendous demand and excitement for that product as well.
So the 1 thing, regardless of what's happening, our job is to continue to adapt and execute. We have taken advantage of the internal things we can control whether it's innovation or the clinical research, and we feel that nothing stops innovation.

I think your -- it's a very insightful question, because you're recognizing what we've been investing in is to provide a level of support that doesn't exist in the industry, whether it's bedside or in the cloud or capturing the data, or even training nurses. So as the nurses that are coming into the ICU, they're newer, we can work with them, we can do hands-on training, they can go online and do CME training, and we can coordinate specialized care. So we continue to do that.
I just want to be clear, though, that the Delta variant had the massive impact and what made it more complicated for us and the playbook was the labor shortages that did not impact 75% of our sites. The impact was more of 25% of our sites. And for shock, it impacted less than that 17%. So I think that what we're doing is we're whittling away at it, and we're trying to minimize it with exactly what you're talking about with our bedside support, with our SmartAssist. It makes managing the patient easier with Impella Connect, putting that in the cloud, so that our experts, our nurses, our call center and our local people as well as the physicians can review that patient without being bedside and then quantitatively put numbers on it and track it.
So I think all the things that you -- we've mentioned and you're pointing to, that does give us an advantage and allows the hospital to benefit from our services, and that's where this network approach, our ability to have the premier field team is really coming into play, and I think will continue to help us drive positive growth."

And we really want to credit the FDA for this really innovative and amazing program. It's actually transformed the medical device field. And what that also means to us is you can come in, and we will be applying for breakthrough for the BTR pump as well, which is similar to the ECP is it allows the FDA to prioritize, to put resources, to be flexible and to have a faster cycle, but allows you to enter in almost in like a prelaunch. And again, on all of these studies, as you get into the pivotals, you are -- it's a controlled study, but you are generating revenue. The hospitals are getting DRG payment. And in our own space, this is kind of how we launch anyhow.
We go slow and steady, because it's so important to learn to get great outcomes. And I kind of see it as somewhat of as a preclinical launch, but it puts this technology into the hands of these U.S. physicians, and it really helps drive this heart team approach. And as you can see from our portfolio, you now have products for the cath lab, surgical suite, EP lab and of course, the ICU, all running in the cloud. And I think that just is a great advantage for us to bring technology earlier into the U.S."

With that said, if you look at some of the states like Carolina -- the Carolinas, if you look at their ICU capacity over the last 6, 7, 8 days, they've gotten worse. And so I think this is going to be a lot of these areas where you're going to see areas like North Florida, Texas. Obviously, we've seen improvement in those metrics in the month of September as we get into October, but you see some other flare ups and like I said, Carolinas, some areas in Northern New England that are just continue to pop up.
So overall, I'd say it's getting better. But we continue to believe that you'll see these hotspots pick up, especially as people move inside during the winter months and it might move up the coast a little bit. But again, it's something we're tracking every single day."

And again, we've done over 15,000 patients with ECpella over the years, and now we have our own ECMO products. So that trend will continue, but that trend works both ways. One is a physician that's struggling with a 14 French hole just on the Impella, which is a 9-French catheter. That's something that ECMO is 17 to 19 French large tubes all the way through. So there's definitely an intimidation and an issue there with bleeding in ECMO, that's in the literature as well as inflammatory response and risk of stroke.
Relative to the overall process, I think it's good, because people are learning about mechanical circulatory support. People are thinking quicker about how do I get to that support. There's been a publication that talks about the centers that have shock teams. They do a better job of getting better outcomes. They technically talked about it, they use less and what they mean less is, they're using less probably escalation of inotropes and just balloon pumps, and they're moving quicker to the best practices of pre PCI in shock or escalating, looking for right heart failure or using ECMO or ECpella where you need oxygenation.
So I think that's all been very positive. And again, on COVID, the majority of those patients are V-V ECMO. And so I think there's also some education that's been happening around just the oxygenation and the need for oxygenation versus cardiac support. So it's all been positive. And again, we continue to do everything we can to support patients, whether they have lung problems or heart problems."

And that is a very conservative number out of the 1.6 million Class III and 400,000 Class IV patients that are looking to have the ability to feel better and also potentially get better. And that's a subset of what we would call the acute on chronic heart failure patients. Those are also the patients that are, I think, the second highest admission into the hospital. To some extent, we're going to start treating those patients earlier with preCARDIA, which is a preload reduction device that can be put in, in the ICU with the heart failure cardiologists. And for those that get worse, they may go on to 5.5. And for those that are just going to require longer-term support, the Impella BTR is not FDA approved, but that is the intent to go through the study to then utilize this technology for those patients as well.
The LVAD technology is vastly improved over the years. However, it still requires a sternotomy and coring out of the left ventricle, and it doesn't provide forward flow. So in some cases, the valves are sewn shut. And what we're trying to do is give that patient and that physician full support with a minimally invasive axillary implant through the shoulder, allow the patient to get up and walk around and it buys them many options of recovery and other therapies that they can utilize."

And what your -- what the impact that it's having is we're becoming quite frankly, a preferred provider for heart surgeons, especially at the top center, Cedars, Northwestern, Cleveland Clinic, Hackensack as you go around the country. And we're not necessarily looking at it as a single product. We're looking at it as a way to solidify our partnership with the hospital and bringing the heart team together, because those surgeons also do high-risk CABG, where they potentially need support. And those surgeons in some cases, turn down patients that then get referred over for PCI.
One example is at Cleveland Clinic in their protocol, if you're an acute on chronic patient, so the patients I just talked about, you have worn out heart, you have advanced coronary disease and you decompensate. At that facility, they're likely going to stabilize you with a 5.5, then they're going to do an evaluation of what treatment they're going to do. And some of those patients go to the cath lab with the 5.5, some of those patients go to the EP lab with the 5.5 and some of those patients go on to CABG. And so it's really designing a protocol that allows for the ability to stabilize the patient, protect the heart and the kidneys, and then bring whatever treatment adjunctive therapies that's in the best interest of that patient.

Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we made progress on advancing our innovation, expanding clinical evidence and leveraging our premier commercial field team in a challenging environment with COVID and hospital staffing shortages. In Q2, Abiomed delivered $248 million of revenue, up 18% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in the U.S. and record revenues in Europe and Japan, up 24% and 19%, respectively. The growth was driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our U.S. surgical business. We believe Delta and hospital labor shortages had regional impacts beginning in August and continuing into September. As a result, only 75% of our U.S. regions grew year-over-year. For the 25% of the regions negatively impacted, we believe, based on prior experience, we will see recovery in those regions in the future.
In Q2, the shortage of hospital staff, especially nursing, was a new dynamic that we had not experienced during the COVID pandemic. As a result, the Q2 revenue missed our internal July expectations. Overall, hospitals today are managing the treatment of the pandemic better, but Impella usage in the cath lab is still impacted by ICU capacity limitations. Hospital staffing shortages in the U.S. caused some health systems to reduce cardiac procedures or temporarily close facilities. Despite these headwinds faced within the quarter, the majority of U.S. regions remained resilient and recorded growth.
In Q2, we adapted within the quarter, by leveraging our Abiomed 2.0 playbook, which included monitoring specific trends on new COVID cases and hospital ICU capacity. This gave us the ability to adapt quickly to support high-risk or emergent patients, assist in patient transfer from spoke to hub, or support the ICU and patient with an Abiomed representative bedside or on the phone with Impella Connect.
Operationally, we achieved a 24% operating margin while investing a record level of $41 million in research and development to continue to advance our pipeline of life-saving devices. Our balance sheet remains robust with $862 million in cash and 0 debt, and our patent portfolio continues to gain strength with 1,297 patents and over 1,100 patents pending. We believe Abiomed has 1 of the strongest IP portfolios in the medical device industry, and we will add to it as we continue to innovate.
On today's call, I will highlight advances in innovation, progress on regulatory approvals, and how Abiomed's premier field team is providing heart hospital teams breakthrough technology, landmark clinical studies and 24/7 support during a challenging time. At Abiomed, leading in technology and innovation is 1 of our 4 principles. During the quarter, we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the FDA PMA approval for the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist. This is our minimally invasive forward flow, fully unloading heart pump designed for heart surgeons with direct or axillary implantation in less than 60 minutes. This game-changing technology has enabled minimally invasive implantation with ambulation for more than 3,000 patients in the U.S. and has achieved greater than a 70% survival in a very sick, cardiogenic shock patient population.
As a result, in Q2, U.S. Surgical revenue grew 60% year-over-year. Today, Impella 5.5 is in 27% of U.S. heart hospitals or 306 of the 1,113 hospitals. Furthermore, we are eager to bring this technology to Japan, and have already applied for PMDA approval. We believe the Japanese market is ideal for Impella 5.5 given its ability to provide minimally invasive, longer-term, unloading support, enabling native heart recovery in a country culturally averse to heart transplants and invasive sternotomies. We expect to receive Japanese PMDA approval for Impella 5.5 by this April 2022. 
In Q2, we also expanded our Abiomed Breethe OXY-1 System to a total of 7 U.S. sites and have treated 53 patients, which concludes Phase II of our pilot site product launch. The clinical feedback, primarily from heart surgeons on this compact cardiopulmonary bypass system, has been positive based on the ease of use with a simple, intuitive interface and the light portable design allowing for patient ambulation. We will continue introducing this device at a measured pace and bring our disciplined approach to clinical data and innovation to the ECMO space.
On the regulatory front, we achieved multiple milestones. First, we launched Impella RP with SmartAssist at 4 sites and treated patients within the quarter. This smart pump is the next generation of our FDA-approved right heart device with a sensor and exclusive weaning capability. We also continue to make progress on the Impella RP with insertion through the internal jugular vein or IJ in the neck, as compared to the femoral vein in the leg. This is the preferred placement for heart surgeon -- heart surgeons and allows for early patient ambulation. We expect to file an Impella RP PMA supplement at the end of the fiscal year.
Second, in August, the FDA granted breakthrough device designation to Impella ECP. This designation means the FDA will prioritize Impella's ECP regulatory review processes including design iterations, clinical study protocols and PMA application. To date, we have enrolled 26 patients in the pilot EFS study at 4 hospitals. Based on the interaction with the FDA, we believe the high-risk PCI pivotal study will require a single arm with up to 225 Impella ECP patients at approximately 30 sites. We expect to lock in these details this quarter and enroll our first pivotal ECP patient in March and April, around the same time as our first Impella BTR patient in our FDA early feasibility study.
Moving to my last highlight, Abiomed's premier commercial team has positioned us as the leading heart recovery company, validated with our breakthrough technology landmark clinical studies, and 24/7 clinical support. We are also actively engaging the referring community with our direct-to-patient initiative and hub-and-spoke model to bring awareness and treatment options to this underserved cardiac disease, high-risk patient population. Our Impella Connect remote monitoring and 24/7 support has been valuable to the healthcare providers during the COVID-19 resurgence and nurse labor shortages, because we assist with patient management as ICUs become strained.
Impella Connect software is now live at more than 85% of our U.S. sites, allowing for the majority of our U.S. patients on support to be monitored in the cloud by the field, the call center or the customer. Outside of the U.S., our Impella Connect software is now live at 37% of our Japanese sites and 14% of our European sites. Today, no other company in this space offers this level of support and expertise.
Before I share a patient story, I want to remind listeners that 15 million Americans live with cardiac disease and it is the #1 cause of death in the U.S. with 875,000 deaths per year. Additionally, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women.
Now our Impella patient Frannie Argulis, 61, is a mother, grandmother and nursing supervisor from Henrico, Virginia. Earlier in the year, Frannie experienced jaw pain then collapsed at home. Frannie's husband called 911 and the paramedics transported her to where she works at St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. The cardiologists remove blood clots in the cath lab and placed a stent in Frannie's right coronary artery. During the procedure, she went into cardiogenic shock and the cardiologists, Dr. Darren Appleton and Dr. Peter Rowe inserted the Impella CP with SmartAssist to support her left ventricle. While on support, SmartAssist technology triggered suction alarms, alerting physicians to check for right heart failure. Further testing confirmed right ventricular failure and the physicians inserted Impella RP to provide biventricular support.
After 1 day, Frannie's left ventricle function improved and Impella CP was removed. 7 days later, Impella RP was weaned and removed and 3 days later, Frannie returned home. Today, Frannie has normal heart function with an EF of 55% and is back to work as a nursing supervisor and living an active lifestyle with her grandchildren. As a heart recovery patient, her insurer, Medical Mutual, will avoid paying for the most expensive and invasive lifetime procedures that come with LVADs and heart transplant.
In conclusion, in Q2, we made progress on product innovation and regulatory milestones, while leveraging our commercial field team and the Abiomed 2.0 playbook in a challenging environment. Abiomed remains focused on disciplined execution and sustainable growth as we continue to pursue our goal of becoming the global standard of care to recover hearts and save lives.
To our employees and customers, you are the best in the industry. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to putting patients first. And to our shareholders, thank you for your continued support.
I will now turn the call over to Todd."

In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $248 million, an increase of 18% versus prior year. Despite the challenges of the Delta variant and hospital labor shortages, we delivered double-digit growth across all geographies with record revenues in Europe and Japan. By region, the U.S. reported revenue of $200 million, up 16% versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization and continued strength in our Surgical business. U.S. patient utilization increased 8% year-over-year, with growth in high-risk PCI and double-digit growth in cardiogenic shock. As Mike mentioned, we believe Delta and labor shortages had a more significant impact on patient utilization within the quarter, which caused us to miss our internal goal.
We will continue to leverage our Abiomed 2.0 playbook to adapt in this environment and assist the hospital's ICUs. Our product penetration continues to drive adoption and revenue growth. As a reminder to investors, all of the following details on product installed base is summarized in our quarterly slide deck. In the U.S., at the end of September, the Impella 2.5 and CP have reached 1,549 sites. The Impella 5.0 has been placed in 666 sites, and the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist is now in 306 sites, up 49 sites versus prior quarter. The full market release of the Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist continues to perform well, with U.S. revenue growing 116% year-over-year.
Finally, the Impella RP is in 634 sites. In the quarter, the reorder rate was 102%, slightly above prior year. Average combined inventory at the hospitals for the Impella 2.5 and CP was approximately 4.8 units per site, slightly above the inventory levels we saw last quarter. We continue to see a favorable impact on revenue from sales mix in the U.S., resulting in about 4 points of growth.
Outside the U.S., we delivered record revenue of $48 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our European revenue increased 28% to $33 million versus prior year, driven by higher patient utilization, sales mix and timing of orders. However, Germany was slightly impacted by extended physician vacations, combined with nursing shortages in select areas. Despite these headwinds, our European business delivered record revenue in our second quarter. In Japan, we also delivered a record revenue quarter of $12 million, up 19% year-over-year. Impella utilization remained strong, up 33% versus prior year despite headwinds from a COVID resurgence in the Summer Olympics.
Within the quarter, we opened 9 new sites, bringing our total sites to 180 out of a potential 350 hospitals.
Moving to key financial metrics. Gross margin was 82.3% in the quarter compared to 81.5% in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was driven by sales mix and higher production volumes. In the second quarter, R&D expense totaled $41 million, an increase of 34% versus prior year. Year-over-year growth was driven by investments in small board devices like Impella ECP and XR Sheath. Future heart failure technologies such as preCARDIA and Impella BTR and STEMI DTU and PROTECT IV randomized controlled trials.
SG&A expense for the second quarter totaled $103 million, up 30% versus prior year, driven by investments in our direct-to-patient initiative, customer training and additions to our premier distribution team. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating income was $60 million, down 1% versus prior year, translating to an operating margin of 24.4%. This reflects growth investments tied to our continued focus on extending our lead with innovation, advancing clinical evidence and further enhancing our distribution team. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $47 million or $1.03 per diluted share versus $46 million or $1.01 in Q2 of '21. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest income and a lower effective tax rate.
We had another solid quarter on cash, as we generated $61 million of operating cash flow. Our balance sheet is robust as we ended the quarter with $862 million of cash in marketable securities.
Now turning to our outlook. With the impact of the pandemic and new challenges with hospital staffing shortages, uncertain conditions remain. In order to provide full transparency to our investors, we want to give insight on our revenue expectations for the second half of the year. The Delta variant and hospital labor shortages in the U.S. impacted August, September and continues to put pressure on Impella procedural volumes in October. Abiomed started the fiscal year with a range of $990 million to $1.03 billion with growth of 17% to 22% versus the prior year. After a record Q1 and a solid July, we upgraded our guidance to $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, with growth of 22% to 24%.
Given our current visibility to October, which appears to be trending towards approximately high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, we expect Q3 global revenue to be slightly up from Q2. This assumes some improvement in Delta rates and hospital staffing in November and December. We now expect fiscal year '22 revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, an increase of 19% to 22% versus prior year and slightly above our original fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 24% to 25%.
In summary, while we navigate through the uncertainties, we remain focused on investing in innovation and clinical research and operational execution to achieve our fiscal year '22 goals. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for Abiomed as we continue to improve outcomes, recover hearts and save lives.

So we have a playbook to adapt to Delta. What was new is a little bit of the shortages of staffing. So the procedures want to be done. The physicians are engaged, but they don't have the surgical techs or the cath lab techs or ICU capacity that limits use. So that impacted about 25%. If we look at our -- just the same metric for cardiogenic shock, 83% of our regions grew. So we're a little more resilient and that plays to our ability to be relevant and help the patients and also help the ICU and the nurses there with training, with support, with online CMEs and anything else that we can do bedside.
If I think about the next part of the year, I think we've got the Delta variant somewhat managed as the hospitals know how to do this better. They're just assuming they're going to continue to have beds allocated for Delta. And don't forget that we treat some of those most severe sick Delta patients with our emergency use authorization for the RP or ECMO, V-V ECMO, which is the majority of our Breethe patients or ECpella. So we're still there providing support.
On the shortages, I think what's going to happen is it's going to be incremental. They're going to continue to prioritize the sickest of the sick patients, which is some of -- or most of our patients. And I think the hospitals are resilient, but they're going to need help. And that's where the Abiomed field team, Impella Connect, IQ database, and the training as well as the networking between the hub and spoke and transfer will be helpful."

So remember, the -- it's the Delta variant with ICU capacity and the nursing shortages. So that's currently impacting less than 20% of our hospitals and we do think that comes back, and we have seen that come back. So I think as time goes on, that will get minimized. I also think it's an opportunity for Abiomed, because of our field team, our clinical expertise, our bedside support, call center and Impella Connect, that we can help augment what they're doing and assist them in that shortage. And I think it's going to get better. And I think hospitals are more resilient now. So we see this as something that will allow us to continue to grow, and we're well positioned as they continue to train new nurses and we'll probably part of that process.
On the XR Sheath, nothing has changed relative to our prior. As you heard on the call, we have a list of new products and new approvals. So we're trying to prioritize for the call here, what are the biggest ones or the most important ones and ones that are happening in the next 6 months. So ECP is a great progress. I think it's ahead of schedule from everything we've been stating. We announced today that we expect to have the 5.5 approved in Japan by April, which is -- hadn't been commented on. And I think the 5.5 is going to be a breakthrough product in Japan, because of the culture there and the aversion to sternotomies and heart transplant.
The BTR pump is there's -- it's a minimally invasive dischargeable LVAD. There's nothing like it in the world. It's what physicians and surgeons have wanted for 10 years. And we expect to be doing patients first in man here in the U.S. through the early feasibility in March and April. We haven't commented about the PreCARDIA, but that continues with the EFS, and we're looking forward to going to Phase III on the ECMO.
So with all of that technology, we have to continue to execute, control what we control. And it just points to the fact that we are the leaders now for the heart team. Essentially, every single heart team out there is working with Abiomed on a product, in the cath lab, the surgical suite or the ICU or in the cloud. And we have the landmark clinical studies to back up the data as well. So we're excited for that. And I think we're going to continue to see more momentum. And whatever happens in the future, we'll be well positioned and will support our hospitals."

We think some of the headwinds from Delta sort of subside over the next 2 months, but that's the expectation as we get into Q3.
And as I look at Q4, when we look at the low end of the range, I think we assume that as the business continues to recover, and we see a modest or gradual lift from Q3 to Q4. Again, as Delta cases improve and hospitals are able to manage -- I'd say, manage better their labor shortages, which are reducing some of the limitations on the ICU capacity. So I think your read is right. And again, we're just trying to be as transparent and provide investors with what we're seeing so far in the month of October."

So starting with Breethe, we have been tracking all the patients. The ECMO space is interesting, because it does not require any clinical data. It's a 510(k) clearance only. And so we are approaching that space as a PMA company. We're looking and collecting the data as a PMA company. We're looking for best practices. What we recently did in Europe is we did our first patient under an ECpella software, where we're combining the software so you can optimize and the systems talk to each other and you can wean that patient, and know what's happening as you unload the heart and also perfuse and oxygenate the body. 
So there's some really amazing things that we're going to be able to do currently and also some things we're going to do in the future with AI. Also, what we're starting to work on, we've done our first patient where we have Impella Connect running from a helicopter and a lot of ambulances are starting to connect with WiFi. So we're putting Impella Connect on the ECMO device. So whether you're ECMO only Impella or ECpella, we'll be able to transmit that data into the cloud. And whether the person is being -- is at a hospital or being transferred on an ambulance or in a helicopter, that will be an exclusive feature.
And we're excited to bring all this innovation and knowledge and clinical expertise to that space.
For the 5.5, it's just -- it is a breakthrough product. I mean you have the ability to have a full VAD. So I've been in this space 18 years. And what the heart surgeons always wanted was a minimally invasive weanable VAD. And with the Impella, you get that. And the fact that it's forward flow means that as the pump is working, it's resting the heart. But as you want to reload the heart, as you turn it down, it allows the heart to naturally start to pump with sensors on the device that we can see how the heart is recovering. And it's really revolutionary, because it's -- all the other VADs and ECMO devices are essentially dumb devices. You put them in and you really don't have any way of knowing how the heart is doing.
And what's most important for these patients is you get survival with native heart recovery, because survival is the low bar. And even if you survive, many of these papers don't even give heart recovery numbers and these patients end up in hospice care or maybe even those that are lucky, they can get a transplant. So the amount of information we're doing around recovery will be accelerated in Japan where they believe in stem cell. They've been -- they've had advanced publications in science of hemodynamic unloading and pressure volume loops. And we think it will be material, be a revolutionary treatment and it will be in a country that really focuses on heart recovery more than anything else, and we're super excited to bring that product to Japan."

We hadn't yet seen a little bit of the August impact, starting with maybe some extended vacations, Delta ramp and then also shortages that are out there in staff.
So I think what happened is in July, it hit in August. August was a little bit down and that carried into September. You're also right that we usually do see the summer quarter dip a little bit. Usually, that dip is in patients, where we go a little down or flat. But we tend to open more centers, do more training. And we do have a lot of new products that we're opening in -- that we've already mentioned. So that's where we expected to see a higher number than we achieved. It is the third highest quarter we've ever done in revenue and patients, but we thought we were going to do better.
And I think what we're trying to give you transparency to is that the model of the 47% to 53% is just probably not going to be a perfect model this year, because of not just COVID, but some of the shortages. But as we're working through the shortages and as I think the hospitals are responding, I think we're going to end up getting back to where we were in the good old days and have just an incredible strong second half of the fiscal year."

Unfortunately, the patients that we treat are really sick. So that's bad for the patient and the hospital, but what that does is that starts to take the beds and an extended stay will take out a lot of our Protected PCI patient availability. And that's where the hub and spoke and moving patients around is helpful. So if something happens in the spoke hospital, we might help with getting that patient transferred to a bigger hub hospital. What we also saw, when we track small, medium and large hospitals, is the trend in September was the medium hospitals tended to be more impacted.
And while we saw the growth happen year-over-year and especially in shock, those medium-sized users of ours were impacted a little more. Maybe they weren't as resilient with their protocols or maybe they were more impacted by the nursing shortages or the facilities were minimized, but I think as we look at the total picture, the cardiogenic shock patients, whether they have COVID or not, that's what's happening. And when you think of myocarditis shock or COVID, you're talking about problems with the lungs, the heart and the kidneys, and that's what our products are designed to do, and that's what our products are FDA approved for.
So we continue to look at this as just a broader heart failure population and specifically to COVID, you've seen the majority of these patients getting ECMO where they do V-V ECMO, where it's pure oxygenation, not necessarily heart support. But that's a great question."

I'm sure COVID is probably a little bit worse than you expected here in the quarter and likely for the rest of the year. So it seems like the $20 million reduction, maybe, I don't know, $12 million of that is COVID related, maybe somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range is staffing shortage related for the back half of the year. So is that a reasonable assessment of what's kind of going on here? And then with this kind of $5 million to $10 million for half of the year impact from a shortage perspective, are hospitals able to adjust here heading into fiscal '23 to offset what's a $10 million to $20 million headwind on the staffing shortage side?

So let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and I tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings.

So let me just kind of walk you through again the rationale and I tried to lay it out during the script with regard to the earnings. But again, as you said here and we got through our first quarter, right? Our first quarter was a record quarter for Abiomed on both revenue as well as patients, right? And then we got into July, and we had, I would say, a really solid July, both from a normal seasonality perspective, and expectations on both revenue and patients. And so if you just look at our annualized, our Q1 performance, at that time, you get to over $1.01 billion. And then as Mike mentioned, right, we typically have normal seasonality, right? So it's typically 47% first half, 53% second half, and that came into our process.
So after the first 4 months, of the year, we felt actually really good about the revised range of $1.03 to $1.05 at that time. And then the Delta surge impacted us in the month of August. And it really hit some of our larger markets, i.e., Florida and Texas as well as some of the other regions in the Southeast. And then what was new for us in August was this dynamic of hospital labor shortages. And so we did not encounter that headwind in the previous pandemic -- in a previous pandemic. And so I think the labor shortages are temporary, but they have been putting more pressure on procedural volumes across the U.S. And I think these 2 headwinds, as I mentioned, really impacted August and September performance and caused us to miss our internal forecast by, I'd say, that $5 million to $7 million range.
With that said, we did still deliver 18% growth versus prior year. And as a reminder, we did have positive growth in Q2 quarter of last year. So I think it was -- we thought it was prudent to really update our guidance at this point of time to $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, which again was slightly above our initial guidance. And again, all we're trying to do is be as transparent with you as we can during these uneven times."

Let me start with our customers and our trialists are totally passionate and committed to these studies. And while other companies are not doing studies or put them on pause, we have multiple RCTs and post-approval studies running. So we did do 18 patients on PROTECT IV. We now have -- I'm going to give you up-to-date numbers. We have 24 randomized patients in P4. We have 28 in the registry for that protocol, and we have 18 sites that are fully enrolling up and running. So that's pretty impressive in the quarter with everything we just went through on Delta and shortages.
On STEMI, we are -- we did it over 10 patients in the quarter. We have 36 sites that are enrolling, and we're at 99 patients. We're going to have a 100-patient recognition here, and that continues to move. So we're excited about that.
The last component of your question, I believe, was the ECP. And we are going to make it a priority. We're going to -- with the sites that are there. We're going to have them enroll and the fact that we'll have a 9 French device, means the peripheral vascular disease and many of these other things that might cause certain challenges, it will cast a wide net and we're going to ask the centers that are in that study to prioritize and to go efficiently, but there is tremendous demand and excitement for that product as well.
So the 1 thing, regardless of what's happening, our job is to continue to adapt and execute. We have taken advantage of the internal things we can control whether it's innovation or the clinical research, and we feel that nothing stops innovation. So as we continue to innovate and improve outcomes for patients, we're incredibly confident in the time lines that are out there for new products in these clinical studies."

I think your -- it's a very insightful question, because you're recognizing what we've been investing in is to provide a level of support that doesn't exist in the industry, whether it's bedside or in the cloud or capturing the data, or even training nurses. So as the nurses that are coming into the ICU, they're newer, we can work with them, we can do hands-on training, they can go online and do CME training, and we can coordinate specialized care. So we continue to do that.
I just want to be clear, though, that the Delta variant had the massive impact and what made it more complicated for us and the playbook was the labor shortages that did not impact 75% of our sites. The impact was more of 25% of our sites. And for shock, it impacted less than that 17%. So I think that what we're doing is we're whittling away at it, and we're trying to minimize it with exactly what you're talking about with our bedside support, with our SmartAssist. It makes managing the patient easier with Impella Connect, putting that in the cloud, so that our experts, our nurses, our call center and our local people as well as the physicians can review that patient without being bedside and then quantitatively put numbers on it and track it.
So I think all the things that you -- we've mentioned and you're pointing to, that does give us an advantage and allows the hospital to benefit from our services, and that's where this network approach, our ability to have the premier field team is really coming into play, and I think will continue to help us drive positive growth."

And again, on all of these studies, as you get into the pivotals, you are -- it's a controlled study, but you are generating revenue. The hospitals are getting DRG payment. And in our own space, this is kind of how we launch anyhow.
We go slow and steady, because it's so important to learn to get great outcomes. And I kind of see it as somewhat of as a preclinical launch, but it puts this technology into the hands of these U.S. physicians, and it really helps drive this heart team approach.

One is a physician that's struggling with a 14 French hole just on the Impella, which is a 9-French catheter. That's something that ECMO is 17 to 19 French large tubes all the way through. So there's definitely an intimidation and an issue there with bleeding in ECMO, that's in the literature as well as inflammatory response and risk of stroke.
Relative to the overall process, I think it's good, because people are learning about mechanical circulatory support. People are thinking quicker about how do I get to that support. There's been a publication that talks about the centers that have shock teams. They do a better job of getting better outcomes. They technically talked about it, they use less and what they mean less is, they're using less probably escalation of inotropes and just balloon pumps, and they're moving quicker to the best practices of pre PCI in shock or escalating, looking for right heart failure or using ECMO or ECpella where you need oxygenation.
So I think that's all been very positive. And again, on COVID, the majority of those patients are V-V ECMO. And so I think there's also some education that's been happening around just the oxygenation and the need for oxygenation versus cardiac support. So it's all been positive.

I mean we've talked about an additional 100,000 patients that we are looking to support as a combination between Impella 5.5 and Impella BTR. And that is a very conservative number out of the 1.6 million Class III and 400,000 Class IV patients that are looking to have the ability to feel better and also potentially get better. And that's a subset of what we would call the acute on chronic heart failure patients. Those are also the patients that are, I think, the second highest admission into the hospital. To some extent, we're going to start treating those patients earlier with preCARDIA, which is a preload reduction device that can be put in, in the ICU with the heart failure cardiologists. And for those that get worse, they may go on to 5.5. And for those that are just going to require longer-term support, the Impella BTR is not FDA approved, but that is the intent to go through the study to then utilize this technology for those patients as well.
The LVAD technology is vastly improved over the years. However, it still requires a sternotomy and coring out of the left ventricle, and it doesn't provide forward flow. So in some cases, the valves are sewn shut. And what we're trying to do is give that patient and that physician full support with a minimally invasive axillary implant through the shoulder, allow the patient to get up and walk around and it buys them many options of recovery and other therapies that they can utilize."

It certainly seem like a bright in the fiscal second quarter as it has for a few quarters now. And I wanted to try to see if you could parse out for us how much of a contribution that made to sort of the overall U.S. patient usage in the quarter? And whether there were any differences in dynamics between 5.5 usage and some of the CP usage as far as kind of COVID and nursing shortages?"

So just at a high level, the 5.5 individually grew 116% year-over-year and it was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. The entire surgical business, the 5.0, 5.5 grew 60%. We also had some growth in the Impella RP. And what your -- what the impact that it's having is we're becoming quite frankly, a preferred provider for heart surgeons, especially at the top center, Cedars, Northwestern, Cleveland Clinic, Hackensack as you go around the country. And we're not necessarily looking at it as a single product. We're looking at it as a way to solidify our partnership with the hospital and bringing the heart team together, because those surgeons also do high-risk CABG, where they potentially need support. And those surgeons in some cases, turn down patients that then get referred over for PCI.
One example is at Cleveland Clinic in their protocol, if you're an acute on chronic patient, so the patients I just talked about, you have worn out heart, you have advanced coronary disease and you decompensate. At that facility, they're likely going to stabilize you with a 5.5, then they're going to do an evaluation of what treatment they're going to do. And some of those patients go to the cath lab with the 5.5, some of those patients go to the EP lab with the 5.5 and some of those patients go on to CABG. And so it's really designing a protocol that allows for the ability to stabilize the patient, protect the heart and the kidneys, and then bring whatever treatment adjunctive therapies that's in the best interest of that patient. Todd could comment if he wants to make a point on the breakout on the numbers."
