At the same time, I am delighted to have Mike Henke stepping into the role. 
As we have announced last week, the FDA has extended the review time line for aducanumab in the U.S. to June 7. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of the aducanumab publication, and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval. 
Let me now review the year. 2020 was a year of uncertainties due to COVID-19 for both society at large and also for our industry, and I am proud of what the Biogen team delivered. For the full year 2020, Biogen generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year as we're experiencing the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry. Full year 2020 non-GAAP earnings were $33.70 a share, a slight increase versus full year 2019. 
Now let me review our progress against our strategic priorities. First, full year MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties, were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., our global MS revenue remained relatively stable for both Q4 and the full year versus 2019. Despite the challenges of launching a new product during COVID-19, we were pleased to see strong improvement in trends for VUMERITY, which has become the #2 MS product and the #1 oral in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe these results demonstrate our ability to maintain leadership and execute well despite increased competition, the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. and COVID-19. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. Q4 global revenues were stable versus Q3. While SPINRAZA is facing increased competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, this was offset by continued growth outside the U.S. We remain committed to further exploring the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with SPINRAZA. This includes the DEVOTE study testing a higher dose as well as the recent initiation of the RESPOND study, evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. There are important questions that remain unanswered on the other approved treatment options, and we are committed to generating relevant data to further inform treatment choices. We believe that SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in the treatment of SMA. 
Third, biosimilars delivered solid performance despite continued COVID-19 impact with revenues of $796 million for 2020, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. We estimate that the use of our biosimilar generated approximately EUR 2.4 billion of savings to the European health care systems in 2020, which should help expand access and create headroom for new innovation. We also made important progress towards potential geographic expansion and future growth for our biosimilars business with the filing of SB11 referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., where, over the next 5 years, biosimilars are expected to generate over $100 billion in savings. 
Fourth, 2020 was a very productive year for our R&D organization. Last year, we submitted regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S., EU and Japan. We remain ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S., if and when it is approved. Our teams have evaluated the availability of specialists, infusion capacity, the ability to confirm the pathology of amyloid beta, MRI capacity and formulary approval processes. We believe there are several hundred sites in the U.S. that are ready to start treating patients should aducanumab be approved. 
Beyond aducanumab, we addressed or advanced 12 new clinical programs last year across MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease depression and biosimilars, including 4 in Phase III. Importantly, we entered new strategic collaboration with Sage and Denali, providing access to potential first-in-class therapies for serious neurological disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Our collaboration with Sage adds important late-stage diversification through Phase III programs in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression with critical readouts expected this year and [ asset ] in depression would offer multiple synergies across Biogen's existing portfolio. Overall, in 2021, we expect 8 mid-to-late-stage data readouts, including 4 programs in Phase III. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation continues to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital. During 2020, we returned approximately $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and allocated roughly $3 billion for business development to enhance our pipeline. 
In summary, 2020 was a very productive year for the company as we have executed on our strategy. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA generics, we have maintained global leadership across our core businesses in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we have made significant progress towards building a multi-franchise portfolio. As Mike will outline with our guidance, we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company financially on both the top and bottom lines, but we believe we can grow the company over the long term. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020",1705,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020 was a year of milestones for Biogen. We made significant progress toward building a multi-franchise portfolio with 10 programs now in either Phase III or filed across a number of key therapeutic areas. We are proud that after more than a decade of work aimed at introducing the first treatments that treat the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, we have completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies. We hope that these filings will pave the way to the introduction of the first therapy that may slow the inevitable clinical decline in patients around the world suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
Moreover, our collaboration partners at Eisai initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial designed to evaluate whether BAN2401 may be of benefit and people with the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease even before they are aware of cognitive impairment. Finally, we bolstered our early and late-stage pipeline through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Denali, Sage and Sangamo. 
Let me now turn to the progress we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The clinical trials of aducanumab were the first to show in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies than an antibody that targets aggregated forms of amyloid results in the robust removal of amyloid plaque and reduces clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Eli Lilly released results from the Phase II trial of donanemab, another anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease. These top line results indicate that donanemab is now the third molecule after aducanumab and BAN2401 to show that antibodies that target the amyloid plaque and produce a robust effect on amyloid plaque reduction also produce a clinical benefit. These Phase II results seen with donanemab were comparable to what was demonstrated by aducanumab in its Phase III trials in terms of amyloid plaque reduction as measured in Central Lloyds as well as clinical effect as measured on a composite scale of ADAS COG and activities of daily living. We plan to present further details on these data at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March. 
These data continue to strengthen our belief than antibodies that target the forms of Abeta concentrated in the amyloid plaque may produce therapeutic benefits, thus distinguishing these molecules from earlier anti-amyloid antibodies. Thus, we are optimistic about the potential for BAN2401 that is currently being evaluated in the CLARITY Phase III trial. The target enrollment for CLARITY has recently been increased by approximately 200 patients to mitigate COVID-19-related dosing challenges in consultation with the FDA. Nevertheless, the anticipated readout timing of Q3 2022 remains unchanged. 
In addition to anti-amyloid therapies, we continue to pursue a number of approaches targeting tau, which, when misfolded, is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. We expect data from the Phase II study of gosuranemab, our anti-tau antibody that aims to prevent the spread of tau in the brain in the first half of this year. We also have BIIB80, a tau-targeted [indiscernible] nucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau. In collaboration with Ionis, we recently learned that the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in mild Alzheimer's disease patients, a BIIB80 treatment was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We plan to present additional details at an upcoming scientific meeting. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB80 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
In summary, across amyloid and tau as well as other targets in the preclinical stage, we are advancing an industry-leading pipeline that seeks to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
Turning to MS. We have made significant progress in bolstering our existing MS franchise. This includes the approval of intramuscular PLEGRIDY in the United States and the European Union, a positive CHMP opinion for subcutaneous TYSABRI and the submission of a marketing authorization application for VUMERITY in the EU. Additionally, we expect the readout for the NOVA study, evaluating the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI by midyear. 
We recently added BIIB107, an antibody that targets alpha 4 integrin to our MS pipeline. The clinical utility of targeting alpha 4 integrin has been proved with TYSABRI, a highly efficacious treatment for relapsing MS. BIIB107 is a new molecular entity that has demonstrated higher binding affinity, reduced Fc effector function and a predictable pharmacological effect in preclinical studies. Our intent is to integrate all of our learnings from TYSABRI, including extended interval dosing, so as to optimize safety, the dosing regimen and patient convenience while maintaining the high efficacy of TYSABRI. 
In neuromuscular disorders, we aim to continue enhancing the therapeutic benefit of SPINRAZA and recently announced that we dosed the first patient in the RESPOND study, which will evaluate the effect of SPINRAZA in patients who have had a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. We also continue to enroll patients in the DEVOTE study, which is evaluating whether the higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. 
In ALS, we recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III trial evaluating tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we look forward to the readout in the second half of this year. 
In movement disorders, we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of BIIB54 in Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Based on our Phase I data in CSF samples with BIIB54, we believe we have tested doses in the Phase II trial that were sufficient to engage extracellular alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of BIIB54 and plan to present detailed studies at a future scientific -- study results at a future scientific meeting. Nevertheless, we believe that the study provides a high-quality clinical dataset that can be used to inform our future efforts in Parkinson's disease. 
Denali recently announced completion of the Phase Ib study for BIIB122, otherwise known as DNL151, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2, which met target and pathway engagement goals. We expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
In stroke, TMS completed enrollment for the Phase II trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke in Q4 of 2020, and we are excited about the upcoming readout expected in the first half of this year. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen and is hypothesized to facilitate thrombolysis selectively at the site of the clot, while simultaneously exerting an anti-inflammatory effect to help reduce the risk of additional tissue damage. We believe the targeted mechanism of action of TMS-007 may result in significant advantages over recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which currently remains a standard of care for ischemic stroke. This includes potentially extending the therapeutic window to 12 hours or beyond, up from the 3 or 4.5-hour window of TPA and reduce the risk of adverse bleeding events. For these reasons, we believe TMS-007 represents a potential best-in-class thrombolytic agency. 
We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III trial of BIIB93 for the treatment of cerebral edema caused by large hematitic infarction despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Finally, we have had a very productive quarter on the business development front, executing a number of collaborations that provide access to innovative potential first-in-class therapies. Significantly accelerating our expansion into neuropsychiatry, we entered into a collaboration with Sage, a leader in psychiatry. Major depressive disorder, or MDD, and postpartum depression, or PPD, are highly prevalent disorders, and we believe that Sage's lead asset, zuranolone, has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for both. We look forward to multiple Phase III -- upcoming Phase III readouts for zuranolone this year, which includes WATERFALL for the episodic treatment of MDD, CORAL for rapid respond therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressive therapy in MDD and SKYLARK in PPD. 
Beyond zuranolone, we will also collaborate on SAGE-324, currently in development for essential tremor with a readout of the Phase II study expected in early 2021. 
Furthering our commitment in ophthalmology, we entered into a collaboration with ViGeneron with the goal of developing gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases. With this collaboration, we aim to use ViGeneron's proprietary AAV capsids to sufficiently transduce retinal cells via intravitreal injections, which could potentially be performed in the clinic and offer efficacy via significantly enhanced retinal area coverage as compared to subretinal injection through surgery. 
More recently, we entered into a collaboration with Atalanta Therapeutics based on technology that comes from the RNA Therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts, started by Nobel Laureate, Dr. Craig Mello. As part of this collaboration, Atalanta will utilize its proprietary branch siRNA platform to develop potential treatments for multiple CNS targets, including HTT for the treatment of Huntington's disease. This collaboration with Atalanta, combined with our recent collaborations with Sangamo, Scribe, ViGeneron and the Massachusetts [indiscernible] Infirmary as well as our long-term collaboration with Ionis extend our ASO and RNAi capabilities and complement our ongoing efforts in gene therapy, including the development of our gene therapy assets for inherited retinal disorders. Additionally, we created a gene therapy accelerator unit to focus on solving the key technological challenges in the field with the goal of bringing to market more gene therapies that may transform the lives of patients. 
In 2020, Biogen R&D assembled and progressed a cutting-edge neuroscience pipeline, employing state-of-the-art therapeutic modalities against genetically well-validated drug targets. As a result, we believe we are well positioned for growth in a transformative year with 8 clinical trial readouts anticipated, including 4 pivotal programs. We remain optimistic on the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are entering a promising time for neurotherapeutics and their ability to meaningfully impact the lives of patients, including potentially bringing the first therapy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."

Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S. generics as we continue to execute well and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very stro",1653,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S. generics as we continue to execute well and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and also share with you our guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.9 billion declined 22% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $13.4 billion declined 6% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the U.S. 
Total MS Revenue for the fourth quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.8 billion, decreased 24% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total MS Revenue for the full year, including OCREVUS royalties of $8.7 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the entrance of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was relatively flat, both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the prior year, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the fourth quarter of $608 million declined 48% versus the prior year and revenue for the full year of $3.8 billion declined 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $288 million increased 1% versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% with continued patient growth. 
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $39 million in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $475 million was relatively flat versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% for the full year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth throughout the year, and believe TYSABRI is well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progress several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $498 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 34% versus the prior year as we see an impact from competition, which is exacerbated by COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year with strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by the maturation of larger European markets. For the full year, global SPINRAZA revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Full year U.S. SPINRAZA revenue decreased 16% and full year revenue outside the U.S. grew 9%. Although new competition in COVID-19 have had an impact on SPINRAZA, as you heard from Michel and Al, we believe SPINRAZA has a very strong efficacy and safety profile and will continue to be a foundation of care. 
Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was flat versus the prior year at actual currency and declined 4% at constant currency. Full year revenue of $796 million grew 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 6% at constant currency. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products to developed by our Samsung Bioepis JV and other biosimilar products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $419 million decreased 30% versus the prior year with relatively flat OCREVUS royalties and a 45% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. Total anti-CD20 revenue for the full year of $2 billion decreased 14% versus the prior year with a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties and a 29% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. The decrease in RITUXAN revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating erosion from biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue versus 88% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products, as well as higher costs related to our corporate partner revenue due to product mix. Gross margin for the full year 2020 was 87% versus 86% in 2019. 
Moving now to expenses. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $642 million and includes $68 million related to external collaboration agreements with Scribe, Atalanta and ViGeneron. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $2.1 billion. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was [ $793 ] million, including approximately $100 million related to launch preparations for aducanumab. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was $2.5 billion, including approximately $250 million related to aducanumab. 
In Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus approximately 16% in 2019. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $400 million. Throughout 2020, we repurchased 22.4 million shares for a total value of $6.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 154 million shares for the fourth quarter and 161 million shares for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $4.58. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $33.70, a $0.13 increase versus the prior year and above our most recent guidance range. 
In 2020, we generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the full year were $425 million and free cash flow was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.4 billion in debt, resulting in $4 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. 
Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2021. We expect full year 2021 revenue to be between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $17 and $18.50 per share and capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $425 million. It is important to note that this guidance is based on a number of critical assumptions which are currently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our results. 
Our guidance assumes aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. As a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. Post commercialization, we would book 100% of net revenue in the U.S. and [indiscernible] size profit share of 45% would be booked in a separate line item, which is not part of R&D or SG&A. 
In addition, while the erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business to date has been slower than anticipated, if we are unsuccessful in our legal appeals, we expect a sharp decline during the first half of 2021, and this is our guidance assumption. We also expect significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S.. Along with TECFIDERA, we expect that the reduction in revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. 
Also, as a reminder, in Q2 of 2020, we recorded $330 million in revenues related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion. We remain committed to our long-term growth through continued investment in our pipeline, which has now grown to a total of 33 programs across 10 therapeutic areas, including 10 programs which are in Phase III or filed. Importantly, we expect our pipeline to generate 8 important mid-to-late-stage readouts this year, including 4 in Phase III. 
We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This estimate includes an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A. In addition, it is important to note that we have allocated a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to aducanumab, which could impact 2021 results if aducanumab is not approved. 
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 to be between 16% and 17%, and we assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activity. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, and we have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions. Going forward, we plan to update our full year financial guidance each quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

We are advancing an industry-leading pipeline for Alzheimer's disease. We are waiting an important decision on aducanumab in the U.S. now expected by early June. As Al described, our belief in the therapeutic approach of targeting amyloid plaques has never been stronger. We believe that our data supports the approval of aducanumab, and we are optimistic about BAN2401 in Phase III. We are also pursuing complementary approaches targeting tau pathology with 3 clinical assets targeting either extracellular tau with an antibody or intracellular tau with an ASO. We begin 2021 with an expanded and diversified pipeline, and we anticipate 8 mid-to-late-stage readouts by the end of this year. These include 4 pivotal and 4 Phase II readouts across a number of therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet medical need, such as ALS, stroke and the new Phase III programs in MDD and PPD with Sage. 
We also expect significant milestone across our core business this year. In MS, we are launching intramuscular PLEGRIDY, and we are planning for the potential launch of subcutaneous TYSABRI as well as important data on extended interval dosing in the middle of the year. As we build for the medium to long term, we aim to scale our digital capabilities to further meet the need of patients. As part of our vision to lead in Alzheimer's disease, we are excited to be collaborating with Apple to develop potential digital biomarkers that may aid in diagnosing and monitoring disease progression at the earlier stage of cognitive decline. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aiming for superior returns from the investment we make. 
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we take a holistic view of health and strive to improve the broader society we serve. Now more than ever, we continue to invest in climate and health, access and equity as well as diversity and inclusion.

The first one is the clinical meaningfulness and potentially in terms of cognitive functions, but also functional aspects on activity of daily living. This is one side of the equation. The second one is the cost of Alzheimer's to society, which is nowadays more than $550 billion a year in the U.S. The cost for caring per patient, if I'm not mistaken, it's more than $0.5 million.

You should not expect that we would be able to mitigate 100% of those costs, but we would be able to mitigate a meaningful portion. And obviously, we would maximize the amount that we would mitigate. The other point that I would just remind on is that in the U.S., substantially all of the costs that we incur for aducanumab are subject to our agreement with Eisai, which in the U.S. is reimbursable at the rate of 45%. And so when you look at the guidance that we gave, the $600 million that's in SG&A, there's about $200 million that would be reimbursable out of that, that would come through on a different line in our P&L, on our collaboration sharing line. And the reason why that ratio is a little bit different than you would expect is because the accounting is complex and it differs a bit pre and post launch. Some of the Eisai reimbursements are actually netted in that $600 million and the rest come through that collaboration line. But at the end of the day, economically, it is a 45% reimbursement schedule that's important to remember."

And I think at the end of the day, the important point is that we continue to really believe in the efficacy of SPINRAZA and its safety profile, and we do believe it will continue to become a -- it will remain a very important treatment option, particularly once we get through the pandemic."

And by targeting the plaque, it removes amyloid quite efficiently in the brain. Donanemab binds to the pyroglutamated form of Abeta, which is present early in the plaque. It's thought to kind of seed the plaque, if you will, and it forms part of the dense core. So in that way, it targets plaque as well. So different ways of targeting the plaque essentially. In terms of PK, I don't know too much about the PK of donanemab, but I can -- I suspect since it's an antibody, it has roughly similar characteristics to other monoclonal antibodies, roughly a half-life of 2 weeks, et cetera."

I think it's a large market, and I think it will accommodate multiple therapeutic options, which hopefully will be available for patients. The concept of intermediate dosing or down dosing perhaps after changing the dose after plaque removal is an interesting one. It's something that can be tested and is being evaluated across multiple drugs, aducanumab, BAN2401 as well as donanemab. I'd say that one thing is there's the effect on neurodegeneration with respect to plaque removal, but there may also be other effects, more acute effects. When you listen to patients, in particular, you may have heard at the FDA advisory committee that patients seem to have -- have untoward effects after stopping aducanumab, and then they regain some of these benefits after restarting in a relatively short period of time. And that's -- and something similar has been seen with other antibodies, including BAN2401. That second piece maybe something more associated with synaptic function, which may be more associated with the soluble oligomer side of things, and I think that will remain to be learned about in the future study."

But the first generation of antibodies did not really target the amyloid plaque. For example, solanezumab, which was a Lilly antibody, bound to mono-soluble monomeric amyloid Abeta. And if you read the 2012 paper on the plaque specific antibody, they were concerned that such an antibody will not get to the plaque and remove plaque -- pre-existing plate. So even while they had solanezumab in development, Lilly began working on a plaque specific antibody. And so I think that's what those FDA documents might have been pointing to that it's not just that you have an anti-amyloid antibodies. We have to have those that will target the plat and remove preexisting amyloid plaque in patients. I think also bapineuzumab, bapineuzumab was nonselective. It bound to soluble monomeric as well as insoluble aggregated forms of amyloid as well as soluble aggregated, and that led to issues with dosing. And so I think that's what they've meant is perhaps solanezumab and bapineuzumab may not have shown clinical efficacy for these kinds of reasons. But I think that we should not assume that this next generation of antibodies that target the plaque better. Look, we all learned from the early studies, right? And so I think donanemab is another example where those that target the plaque and remove amyloid robustly in humans. And if you study early-stage patients selected for carefully, you will see efficacy."

As we have announced last week, the FDA has extended the review time line for aducanumab in the U.S. to June 7. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of the aducanumab publication, and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval. 
Let me now review the year. 2020 was a year of uncertainties due to COVID-19 for both society at large and also for our industry, and I am proud of what the Biogen team delivered. For the full year 2020, Biogen generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year as we're experiencing the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry. Full year 2020 non-GAAP earnings were $33.70 a share, a slight increase versus full year 2019. 
Now let me review our progress against our strategic priorities. First, full year MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties, were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., our global MS revenue remained relatively stable for both Q4 and the full year versus 2019. Despite the challenges of launching a new product during COVID-19, we were pleased to see strong improvement in trends for VUMERITY, which has become the #2 MS product and the #1 oral in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe these results demonstrate our ability to maintain leadership and execute well despite increased competition, the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. and COVID-19. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. Q4 global revenues were stable versus Q3. While SPINRAZA is facing increased competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, this was offset by continued growth outside the U.S. We remain committed to further exploring the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with SPINRAZA. This includes the DEVOTE study testing a higher dose as well as the recent initiation of the RESPOND study, evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. There are important questions that remain unanswered on the other approved treatment options, and we are committed to generating relevant data to further inform treatment choices. We believe that SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in the treatment of SMA. 
Third, biosimilars delivered solid performance despite continued COVID-19 impact with revenues of $796 million for 2020, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. We estimate that the use of our biosimilar generated approximately EUR 2.4 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2020, which should help expand access and create headroom for new innovation. We also made important progress towards potential geographic expansion and future growth for our biosimilars business with the filing of SB11 referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., where, over the next 5 years, biosimilars are expected to generate over $100 billion in savings. 
Fourth, 2020 was a very productive year for our R&D organization. Last year, we submitted regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S., EU and Japan. We remain ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S., if and when it is approved. Our teams have evaluated the availability of specialists, infusion capacity, the ability to confirm the pathology of amyloid beta, MRI capacity and formulary approval processes. We believe there are several hundred sites in the U.S. that are ready to start treating patients should aducanumab be approved. 
Beyond aducanumab, we addressed or advanced 12 new clinical programs last year across MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease depression and biosimilars, including 4 in Phase III. Importantly, we entered new strategic collaboration with Sage and Denali, providing access to potential first-in-class therapies for serious neurological disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Our collaboration with Sage adds important late-stage diversification through Phase III programs in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression with critical readouts expected this year and asset in depression would offer multiple synergies across Biogen's existing portfolio. Overall, in 2021, we expect 8 mid-to-late-stage data readouts, including 4 programs in Phase III. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation continues to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital. During 2020, we returned approximately $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and allocated roughly $3 billion for business development to enhance our pipeline. 
In summary, 2020 was a very productive year for the company as we have executed on our strategy. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA generics, we have maintained global leadership across our core businesses in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we have made significant progress towards building a multi-franchise portfolio. As Mike will outline with our guidance, we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company financially on both the top and bottom lines, but we believe we can grow the company over the long term. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020 was a year of milestones for Biogen. We made significant progress toward building a multi-franchise portfolio with 10 programs now in either Phase III or filed across a number of key therapeutic areas. We are proud that after more than a decade of work aimed at introducing the first treatments that treat the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, we have completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies. We hope that these filings will pave the way to the introduction of the first therapy that may slow the inevitable clinical decline in patients around the world suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
Moreover, our collaboration partners at Eisai initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial designed to evaluate whether BAN2401 may be of benefit and people with the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease even before they are aware of cognitive impairment. Finally, we bolstered our early and late-stage pipeline through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Denali, Sage and Sangamo. 
Let me now turn to the progress we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The clinical trials of aducanumab were the first to show in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that an antibody that targets aggregated forms of amyloid results in the robust removal of amyloid plaque and reduces clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Eli Lilly released results from the Phase II trial of donanemab, another anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease. These top line results indicate that donanemab is now the third molecule after aducanumab and BAN2401 to show that antibodies that target the amyloid plaque and produce a robust effect on amyloid plaque reduction also produce a clinical benefit. These Phase II results seen with donanemab were comparable to what was demonstrated by aducanumab in its Phase III trials in terms of amyloid plaque reduction as measured in Centiloids as well as clinical effect as measured on a composite scale of ADAS COG and activities of daily living. We plan to present further details on these data at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March.
These data continue to strengthen our belief than antibodies that target the forms of Abeta concentrated in the amyloid plaque may produce therapeutic benefits, thus distinguishing these molecules from earlier anti-amyloid antibodies. Thus, we are optimistic about the potential for BAN2401 that is currently being evaluated in the CLARITY Phase III trial. The target enrollment for CLARITY has recently been increased by approximately 200 patients to mitigate COVID-19-related dosing challenges in consultation with the FDA. Nevertheless, the anticipated readout timing of Q3 2022 remains unchanged. 
In addition to anti-amyloid therapies, we continue to pursue a number of approaches targeting tau, which, when misfolded, is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. We expect data from the Phase II study of gosuranemab, our anti-tau antibody that aims to prevent the spread of tau in the brain in the first half of this year. We also have BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau. In collaboration with Ionis, we recently learned that the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in mild Alzheimer's disease patients in BIIB080 treatment was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We plan to present additional details at an upcoming scientific meeting. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
In summary, across amyloid and tau as well as other targets in the preclinical stage, we are advancing an industry-leading pipeline that seeks to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
Turning to MS. We have made significant progress in bolstering our existing MS franchise. This includes the approval of intramuscular PLEGRIDY in the United States and the European Union, a positive CHMP opinion for subcutaneous TYSABRI and the submission of a marketing authorization application for VUMERITY in the EU. Additionally, we expect the readout for the NOVA study, evaluating the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI by midyear. 
We recently added BIIB107, an antibody that targets alpha 4 integrin to our MS pipeline. The clinical utility of targeting alpha 4 integrin has been proved with TYSABRI, a highly efficacious treatment for relapsing MS. BIIB107 is a new molecular entity that has demonstrated higher binding affinity, reduced Fc effector function and a predictable pharmacological effect in preclinical studies. Our intent is to integrate all of our learnings from TYSABRI, including extended interval dosing, so as to optimize safety, the dosing regimen and patient convenience while maintaining the high efficacy of TYSABRI. 
In neuromuscular disorders, we aim to continue enhancing the therapeutic benefit of SPINRAZA and recently announced that we dosed the first patient in the RESPOND study, which will evaluate the effect of SPINRAZA in patients who have had a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. We also continue to enroll patients in the DEVOTE study, which is evaluating whether the higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. 
In ALS, we recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III trial evaluating tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we look forward to the readout in the second half of this year. 
In movement disorders, we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of BIIB54 in Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Based on our Phase I data in CSF samples with BIIB54, we believe we have tested doses in the Phase II trial that were sufficient to engage extracellular alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of BIIB54 and plan to present detailed studies at a future scientific -- study results at a future scientific meeting. Nevertheless, we believe that the study provides a high-quality clinical dataset that can be used to inform our future efforts in Parkinson's disease. 
Denali recently announced completion of the Phase Ib study for BIIB122, otherwise known as DNL151, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2, which met target and pathway engagement goals. We expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
In stroke, TMS completed enrollment for the Phase II trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke in Q4 of 2020, and we are excited about the upcoming readout expected in the first half of this year. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen and is hypothesized to facilitate thrombolysis selectively at the site of the clot, while simultaneously exerting an anti-inflammatory effect to help reduce the risk of additional tissue damage. We believe the targeted mechanism of action of TMS-007 may result in significant advantages over recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which currently remains a standard of care for ischemic stroke. This includes potentially extending the therapeutic window to 12 hours or beyond, up from the 3 or 4.5-hour window of TPA and reduce the risk of adverse bleeding events. For these reasons, we believe TMS-007 represents a potential best-in-class thrombolytic agency. 
We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III trial of BIIB93 for the treatment of cerebral edema caused by large hematitic infarction despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Finally, we have had a very productive quarter on the business development front, executing a number of collaborations that provide access to innovative potential first-in-class therapies. Significantly accelerating our expansion into neuropsychiatry, we entered into a collaboration with Sage, a leader in psychiatry. Major depressive disorder, or MDD, and postpartum depression, or PPD, are highly prevalent disorders, and we believe that Sage's lead asset, zuranolone, has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for both. We look forward to multiple Phase III -- upcoming Phase III readouts for zuranolone this year, which includes WATERFALL for the episodic treatment of MDD, CORAL for rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressive therapy in MDD and SKYLARK in PPD. 
Beyond zuranolone, we will also collaborate on SAGE-324, currently in development for essential tremor with a readout of the Phase II study expected in early 2021. 
Furthering our commitment in ophthalmology, we entered into a collaboration with ViGeneron with the goal of developing gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases. With this collaboration, we aim to use ViGeneron's proprietary AAV capsids to sufficiently transduce retinal cells via intravitreal injections, which could potentially be performed in the clinic and offer efficacy via significantly enhanced retinal area coverage as compared to subretinal injection through surgery. 
More recently, we entered into a collaboration with Atalanta Therapeutics based on technology that comes from the RNA Therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts, started by Nobel Laureate, Dr. Craig Mello. As part of this collaboration, Atalanta will utilize its proprietary branch siRNA platform to develop potential treatments for multiple CNS targets, including HTT for the treatment of Huntington's disease. This collaboration with Atalanta, combined with our recent collaborations with Sangamo, Scribe, ViGeneron and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary as well as our long-term collaboration with Ionis extend our ASO and RNAi capabilities and complement our ongoing efforts in gene therapy, including the development of our gene therapy assets for inherited retinal disorders. Additionally, we created a gene therapy accelerator unit to focus on solving the key technological challenges in the field with the goal of bringing to market more gene therapies that may transform the lives of patients. 
In 2020, Biogen R&D assembled and progressed a cutting-edge neuroscience pipeline, employing state-of-the-art therapeutic modalities against genetically well-validated drug targets. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in a transformative year with 8 clinical trial readouts anticipated, including 4 pivotal programs. We remain optimistic on the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are entering a promising time for neurotherapeutics and their ability to meaningfully impact the lives of patients, including potentially bringing the first therapy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."

We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and also share with you our guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.9 billion declined 22% versus the prior year in both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $13.4 billion declined 6% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the U.S. 
Total MS Revenue for the fourth quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.8 billion, decreased 24% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total MS Revenue for the full year, including OCREVUS royalties of $8.7 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the entrance of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was relatively flat, both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the prior year, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the fourth quarter of $608 million declined 48% versus the prior year and revenue for the full year of $3.8 billion declined 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $288 million increased 1% versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% with continued patient growth. 
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $39 million in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $475 million was relatively flat versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% for the full year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth throughout the year, and believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progressed several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $498 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 34% versus the prior year as we see an impact from competition, which is exacerbated by COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year with strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by the maturation of larger European markets. For the full year, global SPINRAZA revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Full year U.S. SPINRAZA revenue decreased 16% and full year revenue outside the U.S. grew 9%. Although new competition in COVID-19 have had an impact on SPINRAZA, as you heard from Michel and Al, we believe SPINRAZA has a very strong efficacy and safety profile and will continue to be a foundation of care. 
Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was flat versus the prior year at actual currency and declined 4% at constant currency. Full year revenue of $796 million grew 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 6% at constant currency. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products developed by our Samsung Bioepis JV and other biosimilar products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $419 million decreased 30% versus the prior year with relatively flat OCREVUS royalties and a 45% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. Total anti-CD20 revenue for the full year of $2 billion decreased 14% versus the prior year with a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties and a 29% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. The decrease in RITUXAN revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating erosion from biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue versus 88% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products, as well as higher costs related to our corporate partner revenue due to product mix. Gross margin for the full year 2020 was 87% versus 86% in 2019. 
Moving now to expenses. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $642 million and includes $68 million related to external collaboration agreements with Scribe, Atalanta and ViGeneron. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $2.1 billion. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $793 million, including approximately $100 million related to launch preparations for aducanumab. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was $2.5 billion, including approximately $250 million related to aducanumab. 
In Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus approximately 16% in 2019. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $400 million. Throughout 2020, we repurchased 22.4 million shares for a total value of $6.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 154 million shares for the fourth quarter and 161 million shares for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $4.58. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $33.70, a $0.13 increase versus the prior year and above our most recent guidance range. 
In 2020, we generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the full year were $425 million and free cash flow was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.4 billion in debt, resulting in $4 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. 
Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2021. We expect full year 2021 revenue to be between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $17 and $18.50 per share and capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $425 million. It is important to note that this guidance is based on a number of critical assumptions which are currently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our results. 
Our guidance assumes aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. As a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. Post commercialization, we would book 100% of net revenue in the U.S. and [ A ] size profit share of 45% would be booked in a separate line item, which is not part of R&D or SG&A. 
In addition, while the erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business to date has been slower than anticipated, if we are unsuccessful in our legal appeals, we expect a sharp decline during the first half of 2021, and this is our guidance assumption. We also expect significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. Along with TECFIDERA, we expect that the reduction in revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. 
Also, as a reminder, in Q2 of 2020, we recorded $330 million in revenues related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion. We remain committed to our long-term growth through continued investment in our pipeline, which has now grown to a total of 33 programs across 10 therapeutic areas, including 10 programs which are in Phase III or filed. Importantly, we expect our pipeline to generate 8 important mid-to-late-stage readouts this year, including 4 in Phase III. 
We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This estimate includes an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A. In addition, it is important to note that we have allocated a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to aducanumab, which could impact 2021 results if aducanumab is not approved. 
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 to be between 16% and 17%, and we assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activity. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, and we have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions. Going forward, we plan to update our full year financial guidance each quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

Biogen demonstrated resilience and strong execution in 2020, positioning us well to manage the impact of TECFIDERA generics and to make 2021 a transformative year for the company as we continue executing on our strategy to build a multi-franchise portfolio. 
We are advancing an industry-leading pipeline for Alzheimer's disease. We are waiting an important decision on aducanumab in the U.S. now expected by early June. As Al described, our belief in the therapeutic approach of targeting amyloid plaques has never been stronger. We believe that our data supports the approval of aducanumab, and we are optimistic about BAN2401 in Phase III. We are also pursuing complementary approaches targeting tau pathology with 3 clinical assets targeting either extracellular tau with an antibody or intracellular tau with an ASO. We begin 2021 with an expanded and diversified pipeline, and we anticipate 8 mid-to-late-stage readouts by the end of this year. These include 4 pivotal and 4 Phase II readouts across a number of therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet medical need, such as ALS, stroke and the new Phase III programs in MDD and PPD with Sage. 
We also expect significant milestone across our core business this year. In MS, we are launching intramuscular PLEGRIDY, and we are planning for the potential launch of subcutaneous TYSABRI as well as important data on extended interval dosing in the middle of the year. As we build for the medium to long term, we aim to scale our digital capabilities to further meet the need of patients. As part of our vision to lead in Alzheimer's disease, we are excited to be collaborating with Apple to develop potential digital biomarkers that may aid in diagnosing and monitoring disease progression at the earlier stage of cognitive decline. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aiming for superior returns from the investment we make. 
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we take a holistic view of health and strive to improve the broader society we serve. Now more than ever, we continue to invest in climate and health, access and equity as well as diversity and inclusion. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. 
We will now open the call for questions."

The first one is the clinical meaningfulness and potentially in terms of cognitive functions, but also functional aspects on activity of daily living. This is one side of the equation. The second one is the cost of Alzheimer's to society, which is nowadays more than $550 billion a year in the U.S. The cost for caring for patients, and if I'm not mistaken, it's more than $0.5 million. By the age of 80, 75% of the patients are in nursing home and this costs more than $100,000 a year.

Obviously, we'll gate the spend as best we can in the event that we don't receive approval. You should not expect that we would be able to mitigate 100% of those costs, but we would be able to mitigate a meaningful portion. And obviously, we would maximize the amount that we would mitigate. The other point that I would just remind on is that in the U.S., substantially all of the costs that we incur for aducanumab are subject to our agreement with Eisai, which in the U.S. is reimbursable at the rate of 45%. And so when you look at the guidance that we gave, the $600 million that's in SG&A, there's about $200 million that would be reimbursable out of that, that would come through on a different line in our P&L, on our collaboration sharing line. And the reason why that ratio is a little bit different than you would expect is because the accounting is complex and it differs a bit pre and post launch. Some of the Eisai reimbursements are actually netted in that $600 million and the rest come through that collaboration line. But at the end of the day, economically, it is a 45% reimbursement schedule that's important to remember."

So obviously, aducanumab is the catalyst, but we do believe that we have the ability to grow the company for the longer term based on what we have in the pipeline and the other pieces that I just mentioned."

And they showed in animals that the [indiscernible] specific antibody achieved that, and they now have confirmed that you get the same thing in humans by amyloid PET imaging. And I think it's great to see that they also seem to show an effect on clinical decline. They use a composite measure of ADAS COG and IADL, which is -- which I think they did because it's a somewhat small study. I think it's like a couple of hundred patients, 200 or 300 patients, and so they had to use a more sensitive endpoint. But it is composed of endpoints that we all recognize in the Alzheimer's field as being important endpoints for the measurement of the disease. So I think it adds to the body of evidence that suggests that targeting amyloid with the right antibody, that get to the plaque and removes plaque is the right approach."

I think it's a large market, and I think it will accommodate multiple therapeutic options, which hopefully will be available for patients. The concept of intermediate dosing or down dosing perhaps after changing the dose after plaque removal is an interesting one. It's something that can be tested and is being evaluated across multiple drugs, aducanumab, BAN2401 as well as donanemab. I'd say that one thing is there's the effect on neurodegeneration with respect to plaque removal, but there may also be other effects, more acute effects. When you listen to patients, in particular, you may have heard at the FDA advisory committee that patients seem to have -- have untoward effects after stopping aducanumab, and then they regain some of these benefits after restarting in a relatively short period of time. And that's -- and something similar has been seen with other antibodies, including BAN2401. That second piece maybe something more associated with synaptic function, which may be more associated with the soluble oligomer side of things, and I think that will remain to be learned about in the future study."

But the first generation of antibodies did not really target the amyloid plaque. For example, solanezumab, which was a Lilly antibody, bound to mono-soluble monomeric amyloid Abeta. And if you read the 2012 paper on the plaque specific antibody, they were concerned that such an antibody will not get to the plaque and remove plaque -- pre-existing plaque. So even while they had solanezumab in development, Lilly began working on a plaque specific antibody. And so I think that's what those FDA documents might have been pointing to that it's not just that you have an anti-amyloid antibodies. We have to have those that will target the plaque and remove preexisting amyloid plaque in patients. I think also bapineuzumab, bapineuzumab was nonselective. It bound to soluble monomeric as well as insoluble aggregated forms of amyloid as well as soluble aggregated, and that led to issues with dosing. And so I think that's what they've meant is perhaps solanezumab and bapineuzumab may not have shown clinical efficacy for these kinds of reasons. But I think that we should not assume that this next generation of antibodies that target the plaque better. Look, we all learned from the early studies, right? And so I think donanemab is another example where those that target the plaque and remove amyloid robustly in humans.

As we have announced last week, the FDA has extended the review time line for aducanumab in the U.S. to June 7. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of the aducanumab publication, and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval. 
Let me now review the year. 2020 was a year of uncertainties due to COVID-19 for both society at large and also for our industry, and I am proud of what the Biogen team delivered. For the full year 2020, Biogen generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year as we're experiencing the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry. Full year 2020 non-GAAP earnings were $33.70 a share, a slight increase versus full year 2019. 
Now let me review our progress against our strategic priorities. First, full year MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties, were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., our global MS revenue remained relatively stable for both Q4 and the full year versus 2019. Despite the challenges of launching a new product during COVID-19, we were pleased to see strong improvement in trends for VUMERITY, which has become the #2 MS product and the #1 oral in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe these results demonstrate our ability to maintain leadership and execute well despite increased competition, the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. and COVID-19. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. Q4 global revenues were stable versus Q3. While SPINRAZA is facing increased competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, this was offset by continued growth outside the U.S. We remain committed to further exploring the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with SPINRAZA. This includes the DEVOTE study testing a higher dose as well as the recent initiation of the RESPOND study, evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. There are important questions that remain unanswered on the other approved treatment options, and we are committed to generating relevant data to further inform treatment choices. We believe that SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in the treatment of SMA. 
Third, biosimilars delivered solid performance despite continued COVID-19 impact with revenues of $796 million for 2020, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. We estimate that the use of our biosimilar generated approximately EUR 2.4 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2020, which should help expand access and create headroom for new innovation. We also made important progress towards potential geographic expansion and future growth for our biosimilars business with the filing of SB11 referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., where, over the next 5 years, biosimilars are expected to generate over $100 billion in savings. 
Fourth, 2020 was a very productive year for our R&D organization. Last year, we submitted regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S., EU and Japan. We remain ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S., if and when it is approved. Our teams have evaluated the availability of specialists, infusion capacity, the ability to confirm the pathology of amyloid beta, MRI capacity and formulary approval processes. We believe there are several hundred sites in the U.S. that are ready to start treating patients should aducanumab be approved. 
Beyond aducanumab, we addressed or advanced 12 new clinical programs last year across MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease depression and biosimilars, including 4 in Phase III. Importantly, we entered new strategic collaboration with Sage and Denali, providing access to potential first-in-class therapies for serious neurological disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Our collaboration with Sage adds important late-stage diversification through Phase III programs in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression with critical readouts expected this year and asset in depression would offer multiple synergies across Biogen's existing portfolio. Overall, in 2021, we expect 8 mid-to-late-stage data readouts, including 4 programs in Phase III. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation continues to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital. During 2020, we returned approximately $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and allocated roughly $3 billion for business development to enhance our pipeline. 
In summary, 2020 was a very productive year for the company as we have executed on our strategy. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA generics, we have maintained global leadership across our core businesses in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we have made significant progress towards building a multi-franchise portfolio. As Mike will outline with our guidance, we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company financially on both the top and bottom lines, but we believe we can grow the company over the long term. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020 was a year of milestones for Biogen. We made significant progress toward building a multi-franchise portfolio with 10 programs now in either Phase III or filed across a number of key therapeutic areas. We are proud that after more than a decade of work aimed at introducing the first treatments that treat the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, we have completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies. We hope that these filings will pave the way to the introduction of the first therapy that may slow the inevitable clinical decline in patients around the world suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
Moreover, our collaboration partners at Eisai initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial designed to evaluate whether BAN2401 may be of benefit in people with the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease even before they are aware of cognitive impairment. Finally, we bolstered our early and late-stage pipeline through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Denali, Sage and Sangamo. 
Let me now turn to the progress we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The clinical trials of aducanumab were the first to show in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that an antibody that targets aggregated forms of amyloid results in the robust removal of amyloid plaque and reduces clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Eli Lilly released results from the Phase II trial of donanemab, another anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease. These top line results indicate that donanemab is now the third molecule after aducanumab and BAN2401 to show that antibodies that target the amyloid plaque and produce a robust effect on amyloid plaque reduction also produce a clinical benefit. These Phase II results seen with donanemab were comparable to what was demonstrated by aducanumab in its Phase III trials in terms of amyloid plaque reduction as measured in Centiloids as well as clinical effect as measured on a composite scale of ADAS-COg and activities of daily living. We plan to present further details on these data at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March.
These data continue to strengthen our belief than antibodies that target the forms of Abeta concentrated in the amyloid plaque may produce therapeutic benefits, thus distinguishing these molecules from earlier anti-amyloid antibodies. Thus, we are optimistic about the potential for BAN2401 that is currently being evaluated in the CLARITY Phase III trial. The target enrollment for CLARITY has recently been increased by approximately 200 patients to mitigate COVID-19-related dosing challenges in consultation with the FDA. Nevertheless, the anticipated readout timing of Q3 2022 remains unchanged. 
In addition to anti-amyloid therapies, we continue to pursue a number of approaches targeting tau, which, when misfolded, is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. We expect data from the Phase II study of gosuranemab, our anti-tau antibody that aims to prevent the spread of tau in the brain in the first half of this year. We also have BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau. In collaboration with Ionis, we recently learned that the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in mild Alzheimer's disease patients in BIIB080 treatment was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We plan to present additional details at an upcoming scientific meeting. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
In summary, across amyloid and tau as well as other targets in the preclinical stage, we are advancing an industry-leading pipeline that seeks to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
Turning to MS. We have made significant progress in bolstering our existing MS franchise. This includes the approval of intramuscular PLEGRIDY in the United States and the European Union, a positive CHMP opinion for subcutaneous TYSABRI and the submission of a marketing authorization application for VUMERITY in the EU. Additionally, we expect the readout for the NOVA study, evaluating the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI by midyear. 
We recently added BIIB107, an antibody that targets alpha 4 integrin to our MS pipeline. The clinical utility of targeting alpha 4 integrin has been proved with TYSABRI, a highly efficacious treatment for relapsing MS. BIIB107 is a new molecular entity that has demonstrated higher binding affinity, reduced Fc effector function and a predictable pharmacological effect in preclinical studies. Our intent is to integrate all of our learnings from TYSABRI, including extended interval dosing, so as to optimize safety, the dosing regimen and patient convenience while maintaining the high efficacy of TYSABRI. 
In neuromuscular disorders, we aim to continue enhancing the therapeutic benefit of SPINRAZA and recently announced that we dosed the first patient in the RESPOND study, which will evaluate the effect of SPINRAZA in patients who have had a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. We also continue to enroll patients in the DEVOTE study, which is evaluating whether the higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. 
In ALS, we recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III trial evaluating tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we look forward to the readout in the second half of this year. 
In movement disorders, we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of BIIB54 in Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Based on our Phase I data in CSF samples with BIIB54, we believe we have tested doses in the Phase II trial that were sufficient to engage extracellular alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of BIIB54 and plan to present detailed studies at a future scientific -- study results at a future scientific meeting. Nevertheless, we believe that the study provides a high-quality clinical dataset that can be used to inform our future efforts in Parkinson's disease. 
Denali recently announced completion of the Phase Ib study for BIIB122, otherwise known as DNL151, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2, which met target and pathway engagement goals. We expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
In stroke, TMS completed enrollment for the Phase II trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke in Q4 of 2020, and we are excited about the upcoming readout expected in the first half of this year. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen and is hypothesized to facilitate thrombolysis selectively at the site of the clot, while simultaneously exerting an anti-inflammatory effect to help reduce the risk of additional tissue damage. We believe the targeted mechanism of action of TMS-007 may result in significant advantages over recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which currently remains a standard of care for ischemic stroke. This includes potentially extending the therapeutic window to 12 hours or beyond, up from the 3 or 4.5-hour window of TPA and reduce the risk of adverse bleeding events. For these reasons, we believe TMS-007 represents a potential best-in-class thrombolytic agent. 
We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III trial of BIIB93 for the treatment of cerebral edema caused by large hematitic infarction despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Finally, we have had a very productive quarter on the business development front, executing a number of collaborations that provide access to innovative potential first-in-class therapies. Significantly accelerating our expansion into neuropsychiatry, we entered into a collaboration with Sage, a leader in psychiatry. Major depressive disorder, or MDD, and postpartum depression, or PPD, are highly prevalent disorders, and we believe that Sage's lead asset, zuranolone, has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for both. We look forward to multiple Phase III -- upcoming Phase III readouts for zuranolone this year, which includes WATERFALL for the episodic treatment of MDD, CORAL for rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressive therapy in MDD and SKYLARK in PPD. 
Beyond zuranolone, we will also collaborate on SAGE-324, currently in development for essential tremor with a readout of the Phase II study expected in early 2021. 
Furthering our commitment in ophthalmology, we entered into a collaboration with ViGeneron with the goal of developing gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases. With this collaboration, we aim to use ViGeneron's proprietary AAV capsids to sufficiently transduce retinal cells via intravitreal injections, which could potentially be performed in the clinic and offer efficacy via significantly enhanced retinal area coverage as compared to subretinal injection through surgery. 
More recently, we entered into a collaboration with Atalanta Therapeutics based on technology that comes from the RNA Therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts, started by Nobel Laureate, Dr. Craig Mello. As part of this collaboration, Atalanta will utilize its proprietary branched siRNA platform to develop potential treatments for multiple CNS targets, including HTT for the treatment of Huntington's disease. This collaboration with Atalanta, combined with our recent collaborations with Sangamo, Scribe, ViGeneron and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary as well as our long-term collaboration with Ionis extend our ASO and RNAi capabilities and complement our ongoing efforts in gene therapy, including the development of our gene therapy assets for inherited retinal disorders. Additionally, we created a gene therapy accelerator unit to focus on solving the key technological challenges in the field with the goal of bringing to market more gene therapies that may transform the lives of patients. 
In 2020, Biogen R&D assembled and progressed a cutting-edge neuroscience pipeline, employing state-of-the-art therapeutic modalities against genetically well-validated drug targets. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in a transformative year with 8 clinical trial readouts anticipated, including 4 pivotal programs. We remain optimistic on the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are entering a promising time for neurotherapeutics and their ability to meaningfully impact the lives of patients, including potentially bringing the first therapy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."

Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S. generics as we continue to execute well and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very stro",1648,"Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S. generics as we continue to execute well and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and also share with you our guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.9 billion declined 22% versus the prior year in both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $13.4 billion declined 6% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the U.S. 
Total MS Revenue for the fourth quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.8 billion, decreased 24% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total MS Revenue for the full year, including OCREVUS royalties of $8.7 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the entrance of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was relatively flat, both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the prior year, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the fourth quarter of $608 million declined 48% versus the prior year and revenue for the full year of $3.8 billion declined 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $288 million increased 1% versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% with continued patient growth. 
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $39 million in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $475 million was relatively flat versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% for the full year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth throughout the year, and believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progressed several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $498 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 34% versus the prior year as we see an impact from competition, which is exacerbated by COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year with strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by the maturation of larger European markets. For the full year, global SPINRAZA revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Full year U.S. SPINRAZA revenue decreased 16% and full year revenue outside the U.S. grew 9%. Although new competition and COVID-19 have had an impact on SPINRAZA, as you heard from Michel and Al, we believe SPINRAZA has a very strong efficacy and safety profile and will continue to be a foundation of care. 
Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was flat versus the prior year at actual currency and declined 4% at constant currency. Full year revenue of $796 million grew 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 6% at constant currency. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products developed by our Samsung Bioepis JV and other biosimilar products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $419 million decreased 30% versus the prior year with relatively flat OCREVUS royalties and a 45% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. Total anti-CD20 revenue for the full year of $2 billion decreased 14% versus the prior year with a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties and a 29% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. The decrease in RITUXAN revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating erosion from biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue versus 88% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products, as well as higher costs related to our corporate partner revenue due to product mix. Gross margin for the full year 2020 was 87% versus 86% in 2019. 
Moving now to expenses. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $642 million and includes $68 million related to external collaboration agreements with Scribe, Atalanta and ViGeneron. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $2.1 billion. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $793 million, including approximately $100 million related to launch preparations for aducanumab. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was $2.5 billion, including approximately $250 million related to aducanumab. 
In Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus approximately 16% in 2019. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $400 million. Throughout 2020, we repurchased 22.4 million shares for a total value of $6.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 154 million shares for the fourth quarter and 161 million shares for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $4.58. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $33.70, a $0.13 increase versus the prior year and above our most recent guidance range. 
In 2020, we generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the full year were $425 million and free cash flow was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.4 billion in debt, resulting in $4 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. 
Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2021. We expect full year 2021 revenue to be between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $17 and $18.50 per share and capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $425 million. It is important to note that this guidance is based on a number of critical assumptions which are currently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our results. 
Our guidance assumes aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. As a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. Post commercialization, we would book 100% of net revenue in the U.S. and Eisai's profit share of 45% would be booked in a separate line item, which is not part of R&D or SG&A. 
In addition, while the erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business to date has been slower than anticipated, if we are unsuccessful in our legal appeals, we expect a sharp decline during the first half of 2021, and this is our guidance assumption. We also expect significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. Along with TECFIDERA, we expect that the reduction in revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. 
Also, as a reminder, in Q2 of 2020, we recorded $330 million in revenues related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion. We remain committed to our long-term growth through continued investment in our pipeline, which has now grown to a total of 33 programs across 10 therapeutic areas, including 10 programs which are in Phase III or filed. Importantly, we expect our pipeline to generate 8 important mid-to-late-stage readouts this year, including 4 in Phase III. 
We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This estimate includes an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A. In addition, it is important to note that we have allocated a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to aducanumab, which could impact 2021 results if aducanumab is not approved. 
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 to be between 16% and 17%, and we assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activity. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, and we have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions. Going forward, we plan to update our full year financial guidance each quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

We are advancing an industry-leading pipeline for Alzheimer's disease. We are waiting an important decision on aducanumab in the U.S. now expected by early June. As Al described, our belief in the therapeutic approach of targeting amyloid plaques has never been stronger. We believe that our data supports the approval of aducanumab, and we are optimistic about BAN2401 in Phase III. We are also pursuing complementary approaches targeting tau pathology with 3 clinical assets targeting either extracellular tau with an antibody or intracellular tau with an ASO. We begin 2021 with an expanded and diversified pipeline, and we anticipate 8 mid-to-late-stage readouts by the end of this year. These include 4 pivotal and 4 Phase II readouts across a number of therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet medical need, such as ALS, stroke and the new Phase III programs in MDD and PPD with Sage. 
We also expect significant milestone across our core business this year. In MS, we are launching intramuscular PLEGRIDY, and we are planning for the potential launch of subcutaneous TYSABRI as well as important data on extended interval dosing in the middle of the year. As we build for the medium to long term, we aim to scale our digital capabilities to further meet the need of patients. As part of our vision to lead in Alzheimer's disease, we are excited to be collaborating with Apple to develop potential digital biomarkers that may aid in diagnosing and monitoring disease progression at the earlier stage of cognitive decline. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aiming for superior returns from the investment we make. 
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we take a holistic view of health and strive to improve the broader society we serve. Now more than ever, we continue to invest in climate and health, access and equity as well as diversity and inclusion. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. 
We will now open the call for questions."

The second one is the cost of Alzheimer's to society, which is nowadays more than $550 billion a year in the U.S. The cost for caring for patients, and if I'm not mistaken, it's more than $0.5 million.

You should not expect that we would be able to mitigate 100% of those costs, but we would be able to mitigate a meaningful portion. And obviously, we would maximize the amount that we would mitigate. The other point that I would just remind on is that in the U.S., substantially all of the costs that we incur for aducanumab are subject to our agreement with Eisai, which in the U.S. is reimbursable at the rate of 45%. And so when you look at the guidance that we gave, the $600 million that's in SG&A, there's about $200 million that would be reimbursable out of that, that would come through on a different line in our P&L, on our collaboration sharing line. And the reason why that ratio is a little bit different than you would expect is because the accounting is complex and it differs a bit pre and post launch. Some of the Eisai reimbursements are actually netted in that $600 million and the rest come through that collaboration line. But at the end of the day, economically, it is a 45% reimbursement schedule that's important to remember."

And they showed in animals that the pyroglut specific antibody achieved that, and they now have confirmed that you get the same thing in humans by amyloid PET imaging. And I think it's great to see that they also seem to show an effect on clinical decline. They use a composite measure of ADAS-COg and IADL, which is -- which I think they did because it's a somewhat small study. I think it's like a couple of hundred patients, 200 or 300 patients, and so they had to use a more sensitive endpoint.

When you listen to patients, in particular, you may have heard at the FDA advisory committee that patients seem to have -- have untoward effects after stopping aducanumab, and then they regain some of these benefits after restarting in a relatively short period of time.

But the first generation of antibodies did not really target the amyloid plaque. For example, solanezumab, which was a Lilly antibody, bound to mono-soluble monomeric amyloid Abeta. And if you read the 2012 paper on the plaque specific antibody, they were concerned that such an antibody will not get to the plaque and remove plaque -- pre-existing plaque. So even while they had solanezumab in development, Lilly began working on a plaque specific antibody. And so I think that's what those FDA documents might have been pointing to that it's not just that you have an anti-amyloid antibodies. We have to have those that will target the plaque and remove preexisting amyloid plaque in patients. I think also bapineuzumab, bapineuzumab was nonselective. It bound to soluble monomeric as well as insoluble aggregated forms of amyloid as well as soluble aggregated, and that led to issues with dosing. And so I think that's what they've meant is perhaps solanezumab and bapineuzumab may not have shown clinical efficacy for these kinds of reasons. But I think that we should not assume that this next generation of antibodies that target the plaque better. Look, we all learned from the early studies, right? And so I think donanemab is another example where those that target the plaque and remove amyloid robustly in humans. And if you study early-stage patients selected for carefully, you will see efficacy."

As we have announced last week, the FDA has extended the review time line for aducanumab in the U.S. to June 7. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of the aducanumab publication, and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval. 
Let me now review the year. 2020 was a year of uncertainties due to COVID-19 for both society at large and also for our industry, and I am proud of what the Biogen team delivered. For the full year 2020, Biogen generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year as we're experiencing the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry. Full year 2020 non-GAAP earnings were $33.70 a share, a slight increase versus full year 2019. 
Now let me review our progress against our strategic priorities. First, full year MS revenues, including OCREVUS royalties, were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., our global MS revenue remained relatively stable for both Q4 and the full year versus 2019. Despite the challenges of launching a new product during COVID-19, we were pleased to see strong improvement in trends for VUMERITY, which has become the #2 MS product and the #1 oral in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe these results demonstrate our ability to maintain leadership and execute well despite increased competition, the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. and COVID-19. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of $2.1 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year. Q4 global revenues were stable versus Q3. While SPINRAZA is facing increased competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, this was offset by continued growth outside the U.S. We remain committed to further exploring the potential to enhance outcomes for patients with SPINRAZA. This includes the DEVOTE study testing a higher dose as well as the recent initiation of the RESPOND study, evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. There are important questions that remain unanswered on the other approved treatment options, and we are committed to generating relevant data to further inform treatment choices. We believe that SPINRAZA will remain a foundation of care in the treatment of SMA. 
Third, biosimilars delivered solid performance despite continued COVID-19 impact with revenues of $796 million for 2020, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. We estimate that the use of our biosimilar generated approximately EUR 2.4 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2020, which should help expand access and create headroom for new innovation. We also made important progress towards potential geographic expansion and future growth for our biosimilars business with the filing of SB11 referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., where, over the next 5 years, biosimilars are expected to generate over $100 billion in savings. 
Fourth, 2020 was a very productive year for our R&D organization. Last year, we submitted regulatory filing for aducanumab in the U.S., EU and Japan. We remain ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S., if and when it is approved. Our teams have evaluated the availability of specialists, infusion capacity, the ability to confirm the pathology of amyloid beta, MRI capacity and formulary approval processes. We believe there are several hundred sites in the U.S. that are ready to start treating patients should aducanumab be approved. 
Beyond aducanumab, we addressed or advanced 12 new clinical programs last year across MS, ALS, Parkinson's disease depression and biosimilars, including 4 in Phase III. Importantly, we entered new strategic collaboration with Sage and Denali, providing access to potential first-in-class therapies for serious neurological disorders, such as depression and Parkinson's disease. Our collaboration with Sage adds important late-stage diversification through Phase III programs in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression with critical readouts expected this year and asset in depression would offer multiple synergies across Biogen's existing portfolio. Overall, in 2021, we expect 8 mid-to-late-stage data readouts, including 4 programs in Phase III. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation continues to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital. During 2020, we returned approximately $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and allocated roughly $3 billion for business development to enhance our pipeline. 
In summary, 2020 was a very productive year for the company as we have executed on our strategy. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA generics, we have maintained global leadership across our core businesses in MS, SMA and biosimilars, and we have made significant progress towards building a multi-franchise portfolio. As Mike will outline with our guidance, we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company financially on both the top and bottom lines, but we believe we can grow the company over the long term. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need.

I'd like to begin by thanking my colleagues in R&D for their dedication to discovering and developing innovative, potentially life-changing therapies for patients in need. As a result of their hard work, 2020 was a year of milestones for Biogen. We made significant progress toward building a multi-franchise portfolio with 10 programs now in either Phase III or filed across a number of key therapeutic areas. We are proud that after more than a decade of work aimed at introducing the first treatments that treat the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, we have completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies. We hope that these filings will pave the way to the introduction of the first therapy that may slow the inevitable clinical decline in patients around the world suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
Moreover, our collaboration partners at Eisai initiated the AHEAD 3-45 trial designed to evaluate whether BAN2401 may be of benefit in people with the early pathology of Alzheimer's disease even before they are aware of cognitive impairment. Finally, we bolstered our early and late-stage pipeline through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Denali, Sage and Sangamo. 
Let me now turn to the progress we made in the fourth quarter, starting with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The clinical trials of aducanumab were the first to show in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that an antibody that targets aggregated forms of amyloid results in the robust removal of amyloid plaque and reduces clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Eli Lilly released results from the Phase II trial of donanemab, another anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease. These top line results indicate that donanemab is now the third molecule after aducanumab and BAN2401 to show that antibodies that target the amyloid plaque and produce a robust effect on amyloid plaque reduction also produce a clinical benefit. These Phase II results seen with donanemab were comparable to what was demonstrated by aducanumab in its Phase III trials in terms of amyloid plaque reduction as measured in Centiloids as well as clinical effect as measured on a composite scale of ADAS-COg and activities of daily living. We plan to present further details on these data at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March.
These data continue to strengthen our belief than antibodies that target the forms of Abeta concentrated in the amyloid plaque may produce therapeutic benefits, thus distinguishing these molecules from earlier anti-amyloid antibodies. Thus, we are optimistic about the potential for BAN2401 that is currently being evaluated in the CLARITY Phase III trial. The target enrollment for CLARITY has recently been increased by approximately 200 patients to mitigate COVID-19-related dosing challenges in consultation with the FDA. Nevertheless, the anticipated readout timing of Q3 2022 remains unchanged. 
In addition to anti-amyloid therapies, we continue to pursue a number of approaches targeting tau, which, when misfolded, is the principal constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. We expect data from the Phase II study of gosuranemab, our anti-tau antibody that aims to prevent the spread of tau in the brain in the first half of this year. We also have BIIB080, a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau. In collaboration with Ionis, we recently learned that the Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study in mild Alzheimer's disease patients in BIIB080 treatment was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We plan to present additional details at an upcoming scientific meeting. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
In summary, across amyloid and tau as well as other targets in the preclinical stage, we are advancing an industry-leading pipeline that seeks to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
Turning to MS. We have made significant progress in bolstering our existing MS franchise. This includes the approval of intramuscular PLEGRIDY in the United States and the European Union, a positive CHMP opinion for subcutaneous TYSABRI and the submission of a marketing authorization application for VUMERITY in the EU. Additionally, we expect the readout for the NOVA study, evaluating the efficacy of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI by midyear. 
We recently added BIIB107, an antibody that targets alpha 4 integrin to our MS pipeline. The clinical utility of targeting alpha 4 integrin has been proved with TYSABRI, a highly efficacious treatment for relapsing MS. BIIB107 is a new molecular entity that has demonstrated higher binding affinity, reduced Fc effector function and a predictable pharmacological effect in preclinical studies. Our intent is to integrate all of our learnings from TYSABRI, including extended interval dosing, so as to optimize safety, the dosing regimen and patient convenience while maintaining the high efficacy of TYSABRI. 
In neuromuscular disorders, we aim to continue enhancing the therapeutic benefit of SPINRAZA and recently announced that we dosed the first patient in the RESPOND study, which will evaluate the effect of SPINRAZA in patients who have had a suboptimal clinical response to gene therapy. We also continue to enroll patients in the DEVOTE study, which is evaluating whether the higher doses of SPINRAZA can provide greater efficacy than the currently approved dose. 
In ALS, we recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III trial evaluating tofersen in SOD1 ALS, and we look forward to the readout in the second half of this year. 
In movement disorders, we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of BIIB54 in Parkinson's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Based on our Phase I data in CSF samples with BIIB54, we believe we have tested doses in the Phase II trial that were sufficient to engage extracellular alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. As a result, we have decided to discontinue development of BIIB54 and plan to present detailed studies at a future scientific -- study results at a future scientific meeting. Nevertheless, we believe that the study provides a high-quality clinical dataset that can be used to inform our future efforts in Parkinson's disease. 
Denali recently announced completion of the Phase Ib study for BIIB122, otherwise known as DNL151, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2, which met target and pathway engagement goals. We expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
In stroke, TMS completed enrollment for the Phase II trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke in Q4 of 2020, and we are excited about the upcoming readout expected in the first half of this year. TMS-007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen and is hypothesized to facilitate thrombolysis selectively at the site of the clot, while simultaneously exerting an anti-inflammatory effect to help reduce the risk of additional tissue damage. We believe the targeted mechanism of action of TMS-007 may result in significant advantages over recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, which currently remains a standard of care for ischemic stroke. This includes potentially extending the therapeutic window to 12 hours or beyond, up from the 3 or 4.5-hour window of TPA and reduce the risk of adverse bleeding events. For these reasons, we believe TMS-007 represents a potential best-in-class thrombolytic agent. 
We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III trial of BIIB93 for the treatment of cerebral edema caused by large hematitic infarction despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Finally, we have had a very productive quarter on the business development front, executing a number of collaborations that provide access to innovative potential first-in-class therapies. Significantly accelerating our expansion into neuropsychiatry, we entered into a collaboration with Sage, a leader in psychiatry. Major depressive disorder, or MDD, and postpartum depression, or PPD, are highly prevalent disorders, and we believe that Sage's lead asset, zuranolone, has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for both. We look forward to multiple Phase III -- upcoming Phase III readouts for zuranolone this year, which includes WATERFALL for the episodic treatment of MDD, CORAL for rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressive therapy in MDD and SKYLARK in PPD. 
Beyond zuranolone, we will also collaborate on SAGE-324, currently in development for essential tremor with a readout of the Phase II study expected in early 2021. 
Furthering our commitment in ophthalmology, we entered into a collaboration with ViGeneron with the goal of developing gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases. With this collaboration, we aim to use ViGeneron's proprietary AAV capsids to sufficiently transduce retinal cells via intravitreal injections, which could potentially be performed in the clinic and offer efficacy via significantly enhanced retinal area coverage as compared to subretinal injection through surgery. 
More recently, we entered into a collaboration with Atalanta Therapeutics based on technology that comes from the RNA Therapeutics Institute at the University of Massachusetts, started by Nobel Laureate, Dr. Craig Mello. As part of this collaboration, Atalanta will utilize its proprietary branched siRNA platform to develop potential treatments for multiple CNS targets, including HTT for the treatment of Huntington's disease. This collaboration with Atalanta, combined with our recent collaborations with Sangamo, Scribe, ViGeneron and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary as well as our long-term collaboration with Ionis extend our ASO and RNAi capabilities and complement our ongoing efforts in gene therapy, including the development of our gene therapy assets for inherited retinal disorders. Additionally, we created a gene therapy accelerator unit to focus on solving the key technological challenges in the field with the goal of bringing to market more gene therapies that may transform the lives of patients. 
In 2020, Biogen R&D assembled and progressed a cutting-edge neuroscience pipeline, employing state-of-the-art therapeutic modalities against genetically well-validated drug targets. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in a transformative year with 8 clinical trial readouts anticipated, including 4 pivotal programs. We remain optimistic on the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are entering a promising time for neurotherapeutics and their ability to meaningfully impact the lives of patients, including potentially bringing the first therapy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."

Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from COVID-19 and TECFIDERA U.S. generics as we continue to execute well and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and also share with you our guidance for 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.9 billion declined 22% versus the prior year in both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $13.4 billion declined 6% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the U.S. 
Total MS Revenue for the fourth quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.8 billion, decreased 24% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total MS Revenue for the full year, including OCREVUS royalties of $8.7 billion, decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the entrance of multiple generics of TECFIDERA in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was relatively flat, both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the prior year, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the fourth quarter of $608 million declined 48% versus the prior year and revenue for the full year of $3.8 billion declined 13%. Outside of the U.S., fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $288 million increased 1% versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% with continued patient growth. 
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $39 million in the fourth quarter. TYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $475 million was relatively flat versus the prior year and full year revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% for the full year. We were pleased to see continued global patient growth throughout the year, and believe TYSABRI is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progressed several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $498 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 10% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased by 34% versus the prior year as we see an impact from competition, which is exacerbated by COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year with strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by the maturation of larger European markets. For the full year, global SPINRAZA revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Full year U.S. SPINRAZA revenue decreased 16% and full year revenue outside the U.S. grew 9%. Although new competition and COVID-19 have had an impact on SPINRAZA, as you heard from Michel and Al, we believe SPINRAZA has a very strong efficacy and safety profile and will continue to be a foundation of care. 
Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was flat versus the prior year at actual currency and declined 4% at constant currency. Full year revenue of $796 million grew 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 6% at constant currency. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continue to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products developed by our Samsung Bioepis JV and other biosimilar products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $419 million decreased 30% versus the prior year with relatively flat OCREVUS royalties and a 45% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. Total anti-CD20 revenue for the full year of $2 billion decreased 14% versus the prior year with a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties and a 29% decrease in revenue from RITUXAN. The decrease in RITUXAN revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating erosion from biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue versus 88% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products, as well as higher costs related to our corporate partner revenue due to product mix. Gross margin for the full year 2020 was 87% versus 86% in 2019. 
Moving now to expenses. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $642 million and includes $68 million related to external collaboration agreements with Scribe, Atalanta and ViGeneron. Full year non-GAAP R&D expense was $2.1 billion. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $793 million, including approximately $100 million related to launch preparations for aducanumab. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was $2.5 billion, including approximately $250 million related to aducanumab. 
In Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus approximately 16% in 2019. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $400 million. Throughout 2020, we repurchased 22.4 million shares for a total value of $6.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 154 million shares for the fourth quarter and 161 million shares for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $4.58. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $33.70, a $0.13 increase versus the prior year and above our most recent guidance range. 
In 2020, we generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for the full year were $425 million and free cash flow was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $7.4 billion in debt, resulting in $4 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year. 
Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2021. We expect full year 2021 revenue to be between $10.45 billion and $10.75 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $17 and $18.50 per share and capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $425 million. It is important to note that this guidance is based on a number of critical assumptions which are currently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact our results. 
Our guidance assumes aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. As a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. Post commercialization, we would book 100% of net revenue in the U.S. and Eisai's profit share of 45% would be booked in a separate line item, which is not part of R&D or SG&A. 
In addition, while the erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business to date has been slower than anticipated, if we are unsuccessful in our legal appeals, we expect a sharp decline during the first half of 2021, and this is our guidance assumption. We also expect significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. Along with TECFIDERA, we expect that the reduction in revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. 
Also, as a reminder, in Q2 of 2020, we recorded $330 million in revenues related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion. We remain committed to our long-term growth through continued investment in our pipeline, which has now grown to a total of 33 programs across 10 therapeutic areas, including 10 programs which are in Phase III or filed. Importantly, we expect our pipeline to generate 8 important mid-to-late-stage readouts this year, including 4 in Phase III. 
We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This estimate includes an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A. In addition, it is important to note that we have allocated a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to aducanumab, which could impact 2021 results if aducanumab is not approved. 
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 to be between 16% and 17%, and we assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activity. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, and we have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions. Going forward, we plan to update our full year financial guidance each quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

Biogen demonstrated resilience and strong execution in 2020, positioning us well to manage the impact of TECFIDERA generics and to make 2021 a transformative year for the company as we continue executing on our strategy to build a multi-franchise portfolio. 
We are advancing an industry-leading pipeline for Alzheimer's disease. We are waiting an important decision on aducanumab in the U.S. now expected by early June. As Al described, our belief in the therapeutic approach of targeting amyloid plaques has never been stronger. We believe that our data supports the approval of aducanumab, and we are optimistic about BAN2401 in Phase III. We are also pursuing complementary approaches targeting tau pathology with 3 clinical assets targeting either extracellular tau with an antibody or intracellular tau with an ASO. We begin 2021 with an expanded and diversified pipeline, and we anticipate 8 mid-to-late-stage readouts by the end of this year. These include 4 pivotal and 4 Phase II readouts across a number of therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet medical need, such as ALS, stroke and the new Phase III programs in MDD and PPD with Sage. 
We also expect significant milestone across our core business this year. In MS, we are launching intramuscular PLEGRIDY, and we are planning for the potential launch of subcutaneous TYSABRI as well as important data on extended interval dosing in the middle of the year. As we build for the medium to long term, we aim to scale our digital capabilities to further meet the need of patients. As part of our vision to lead in Alzheimer's disease, we are excited to be collaborating with Apple to develop potential digital biomarkers that may aid in diagnosing and monitoring disease progression at the earlier stage of cognitive decline. 
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aiming for superior returns from the investment we make. 
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we take a holistic view of health and strive to improve the broader society we serve. Now more than ever, we continue to invest in climate and health, access and equity as well as diversity and inclusion. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment. 
We will now open the call for questions."

The first one is the clinical meaningfulness and potentially in terms of cognitive functions, but also functional aspects on activity of daily living. This is one side of the equation. The second one is the cost of Alzheimer's to society, which is nowadays more than $550 billion a year in the U.S. The cost for caring for patients, and if I'm not mistaken, it's more than $0.5 million. By the age of 80, 75% of the patients are in nursing home and this costs more than $100,000 a year.

You should not expect that we would be able to mitigate 100% of those costs, but we would be able to mitigate a meaningful portion. And obviously, we would maximize the amount that we would mitigate. The other point that I would just remind on is that in the U.S., substantially all of the costs that we incur for aducanumab are subject to our agreement with Eisai, which in the U.S. is reimbursable at the rate of 45%. And so when you look at the guidance that we gave, the $600 million that's in SG&A, there's about $200 million that would be reimbursable out of that, that would come through on a different line in our P&L, on our collaboration sharing line. And the reason why that ratio is a little bit different than you would expect is because the accounting is complex and it differs a bit pre and post launch. Some of the Eisai reimbursements are actually netted in that $600 million and the rest come through that collaboration line. But at the end of the day, economically, it is a 45% reimbursement schedule that's important to remember."

And they showed in animals that the pyroglut specific antibody achieved that, and they now have confirmed that you get the same thing in humans by amyloid PET imaging. And I think it's great to see that they also seem to show an effect on clinical decline. They use a composite measure of ADAS-COg and IADL, which is -- which I think they did because it's a somewhat small study. I think it's like a couple of hundred patients, 200 or 300 patients, and so they had to use a more sensitive endpoint.

Patients are scared to go to the centers, so they delay the dosing. Some sites are being closed or limited capacity or staffing in order to dose the patients. And last but not least, COVID is accelerating some switches to alternative treatment that exists. We've seen the peak of switch in September and then we've seen a decline of those. And we've seen also, very encouragingly for us, some patients deciding to return to SPINRAZA for reasons of efficacy, perceived efficacy or for reasons of side effects. And last but not least, following the spike of launch, we've seen a rebound in demand for SPINRAZA in towards the end of the year. Mike?"

I would say that we would describe it as in the U.S. competition, which is exacerbated by COVID. We are still growing outside of the U.S. Obviously, in a pandemic that makes the idea of an oral more attractive because you can avoid coming to a health care facility. So the idea that somebody would switch from an injection to an oral becomes more prominent in our current environment. And conversely, it's a little less likely that somebody would switch off of an oral to an injection in that situation. So the impacts that you saw in the fourth quarter in the U.S., we would attribute it all to competition exacerbated by COVID. How much of each is a little bit hard to parse out exactly, but it is both. And I think at the end of the day, the important point is that we continue to really believe in the efficacy of SPINRAZA and its safety profile, and we do believe it will continue to become a -- it will remain a very important treatment option, particularly once we get through the pandemic."

And as such, since both are concentrated in the plaque, aducanumab binds to the plaque. It was actually initially discovered based on a plaque -- amyloid plaque immunoreactivity assay. And by targeting the plaque, it removes amyloid quite efficiently in the brain. Donanemab binds to the pyroglutamated form of Abeta, which is present early in the plaque. It's thought to kind of seed the plaque, if you will, and it forms part of the dense core. So in that way, it targets plaque as well. So different ways of targeting the plaque essentially. In terms of PK, I don't know too much about the PK of donanemab, but I can -- I suspect since it's an antibody, it has roughly similar characteristics to other monoclonal antibodies, roughly a half-life of 2 weeks, et cetera."

I think it's a large market, and I think it will accommodate multiple therapeutic options, which hopefully will be available for patients. The concept of intermediate dosing or down dosing perhaps after changing the dose after plaque removal is an interesting one. It's something that can be tested and is being evaluated across multiple drugs, aducanumab, BAN2401 as well as donanemab. I'd say that one thing is there's the effect on neurodegeneration with respect to plaque removal, but there may also be other effects, more acute effects. When you listen to patients, in particular, you may have heard at the FDA advisory committee that patients seem to have -- have untoward effects after stopping aducanumab, and then they regain some of these benefits after restarting in a relatively short period of time. And that's -- and something similar has been seen with other antibodies, including BAN2401. That second piece maybe something more associated with synaptic function, which may be more associated with the soluble oligomer side of things, and I think that will remain to be learned about in the future study."

But the first generation of antibodies did not really target the amyloid plaque. For example, solanezumab, which was a Lilly antibody, bound to mono-soluble monomeric amyloid Abeta. And if you read the 2012 paper on the plaque specific antibody, they were concerned that such an antibody will not get to the plaque and remove plaque -- pre-existing plaque. So even while they had solanezumab in development, Lilly began working on a plaque specific antibody. And so I think that's what those FDA documents might have been pointing to that it's not just that you have an anti-amyloid antibodies. We have to have those that will target the plaque and remove preexisting amyloid plaque in patients. I think also bapineuzumab, bapineuzumab was nonselective. It bound to soluble monomeric as well as insoluble aggregated forms of amyloid as well as soluble aggregated, and that led to issues with dosing. And so I think that's what they've meant is perhaps solanezumab and bapineuzumab may not have shown clinical efficacy for these kinds of reasons. But I think that we should not assume that this next generation of antibodies that target the plaque better. Look, we all learned from the early studies, right? And so I think donanemab is another example where those that target the plaque and remove amyloid robustly in humans. And if you study early-stage patients selected for carefully, you will see efficacy."

With a strong focus on operational execution, we have continued to serve patients and advance our strategic priorities. While we know that 2021 will be a financial restructure for the company, we are pleased with our operational performance during Q1, with first quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion and first quarter non-GAAP EPS of $5.34. These results were driven by solid performance across MS, SMA and biosimilars, together with continued strong cost management. 
We are ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S. should we receive the regulatory approval, and we anticipate an FDA decision by the June 7 PDUFA date. If approved, aducanumab will be the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer's disease and will represent a significant growth and value creation opportunity. 
Our cross-functional team in the U.S. has been working for months in preparation for the potential launch of aducanumab. We have identified and evaluated key sites of care that have the necessary infrastructure for Alzheimer's patients. We believe that more than 600 of these sites will be ready to treat patients shortly after a potential approval. Our team is currently working to evaluate the capacity at these and other sites to absorb an influx of Alzheimer's patients. 
Together with Eisai, we were pleased to support UsAgainstAlzheimer's in the development of BrainGuide, a platform which is powered by Amazon Web Services. BrainGuide aims to increase brain health awareness and empower people to take action based upon responses to a memory questionnaire. We hope that BrainGuide, along with our collaboration with Apple aiming to identify digital biomarkers of cognitive health, will enable people to seek care sooner in order to maximize the benefits of treatment. 
We are also working to ensure an equitable launch to facilitate broad access to aducanumab, should it be approved, including underserved population, a critical issue that has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pleased to announce that outside the U.S., we recently submitted additional regulatory filings in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Australia, adding to our earlier submissions in Europe and Japan. 
Turning to our progress towards our strategic priorities. First, Q1 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.7 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience and progress. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., the number of patients on our MS products worldwide increased approximately 5% versus the prior year. Importantly, in the current COVID-19 environment, we believe our MS products are well positioned versus the competition based on our current treatment guidelines. 
We were very pleased to see strong revenue growth for VUMERITY, which is now the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescription in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to a strong product profile and our team's ability to execute well, validating our plan announced mid last year to accelerate the launch of VUMERITY. We are also excited that TECFIDERA recently received regulatory approval in China. 
Furthermore, we continue to advance new approaches to help address the remaining unmet medical need in MS. This quarter, we launched an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY in both the U.S. and EU, which we believe offers an improved tolerability profile. And we obtained approval for subcutaneous administration of TYSABRI in the EU with the first expected launch in Germany, while we await a regulatory decision in the U.S. We also continue to advance the potential use of extended interval dosing for TYSABRI with important data expected in the middle of this year. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated first quarter global revenues of $521 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation decreased versus Q4 of last year. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA continued to perform very well with 13% revenue growth versus Q1 of last year. Overall, SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA, and we believe it will remain a foundation of care. 
Third, our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $205 million. We are pleased with this performance as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slowdown in new treatment starts and reduced clinic capacity for immunology patients in Europe. 
We aim to continue to grow our biosimilars business and create additional financial headroom for innovation by launching new products. To that end, we recently announced a collaboration with Bio-Thera Solutions to develop and commercialize BAT1806, a proposed biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, currently in Phase III development. Biogen will have the right to commercialize BAT1806 globally in countries outside of China, which will expand our global biosimilars footprint. 
Fourth, this quarter, we continue to meaningfully progress on our pipeline. We reported Phase II data in essential tremor, and we expect 7 additional mid- to late-stage results this year. Gene therapy represents a key area of focus for Biogen as we continue to pursue multiple modalities. To this end, we recently announced our plan to build a new state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facility at our RTP site in North Carolina. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant flexibility. To allocate capital in Q1, we generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations and $676 million in free cash flow. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. We achieved a number of key milestones this quarter, and we look forward to 7 additional readouts anticipated this year, including pivotal trials in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS and choroideremia. Let me now turn to the advances we made across our pipeline in the first quarter. 
Starting with Alzheimer's disease. As Michel mentioned, this quarter, we submitted additional regulatory filings for aducanumab in Brazil, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. Together with our prior filings in the U.S., EU and Japan, we have now submitted filings in 7 key geographies and continue to engage with regulators as they review the aducanumab data. 
Turning to lecanemab, or BAN2401, our collaboration partner, Eisai, has recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III Clarity study in early Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to the readout in Q3 of next year. Additionally, we plan to present detailed results from the Phase Ib study of BIIB080 in mild Alzheimer's disease at the upcoming AAIC meeting later this year. BIIB080 is a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intracellular and extracellular. The Phase Ib study demonstrated that BIIB080 was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
Moving to MS. We are presenting new data across our portfolio at the AA (sic) [ AAN ] meeting this week. An updated analysis of data from the TOUCH Prescribing Program of TYSABRI showed an 88% reduction in the risk of PML when used with extended interval dosing or EID as compared with standard interval dosing. This supports previous findings that showed that EID is associated with a lower incidence of PML. 
We continue to generate state-of-the-art real-world data through MS PATHS. In MS PATHS, Biogen is collaborating with 10 leading MS centers in the U.S. and Europe to generate standardized, quantitative data from a diverse MS patient population as they are being seen in the clinic. More than 17,000 patients have been enrolled in MS PATHS to date, and we aim to use quantitative measurements across a range of key clinical dimensions, high position MRI measurements of MS disease activity, patient-reported data using a validated quality of life instrument, blood biomarkers such as neurofilament and electronic health records to obtain a more holistic view of MS and gain insights on how currently approved drugs are affecting real-world outcomes. Moreover, with the use of modern analytical methods such as machine learning, we hope to make new discoveries about the key subtypes and stages of MS as well as its pathogenesis. 
At the AAN meeting, we are showing data from the MS PATHS that showed that extended interval dosing of TYSABRI may maintain comparable efficacy to standard interval dosing as assessed by the rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions on MRI scans, quantified by advanced image analysis software, which we developed in collaboration with Siemens. A prospective study of the efficacy of extended interval dosing is being assessed in the ongoing NOVA study from which we expect top line results around midyear. 
Also being presented at AAN, another study leveraging data collected using MS PATHS demonstrated that TYSABRI can lead to clinically meaningful improvements in aspects of mental and social health, as assessed by the Neuro-QoL, a validated instrument that evaluates physical, mental and social effects reported by patients with neurological disorders. For 11 of the 12 domains tested, the adjusted rate of improvement was greater for patients treated with TYSABRI than for those treated with OCREVUS. 
Also being presented at AAN is the first real-world analysis of VUMERITY-treated patients. The retrospective study of 160 patients found that overall persistence was high, with 88% of individuals remaining on VUMERITY at 8 months, and that treatment discontinuation due to GI adverse events was low at 3.8%. And these results follow a recent publication of EVOLVE-MS-2, a Phase III, 5-week randomized multicenter study that assessed the GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA using self-administered questionnaires. The study demonstrated that only 9.5% of VUMERITY-treated patients indicated that GI symptoms interfered quite a bit or extremely with regular activities as compared to almost 29% of TECFIDERA patients. We believe that the differentiated tolerability profile of VUMERITY will lead to improved adherence to therapy. 
In addition to our established treatments, we aim to leverage our MS pipeline to address the remaining unmet need in MS. This includes our oral remyelination program, BIIB061, our oral BTK inhibitor BIIB091, as well as our next-generation anti-VLA-4 antibody that seeks to build on the success of TYSABRI in the high efficacy space. 
Turning to neuromuscular disorders. We are presenting an update on the ongoing DEVOTE study, testing a higher dose of SPINRAZA at the AAN meeting this week. Data from the patients enrolled in the Part A open-label safety evaluation cohort, followed for up to approximately five months, were consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of the currently approved 12 milligram dose of SPINRAZA. The emerging safety profile of the higher dose supports its continued development as we evaluate the potential for greater efficacy. 
We also added an additional cohort to the Phase I study of BIIB078, our C9orf ASO for ALS. Safety data has been supportive of escalating the dose, enabling us to conduct a more complete evaluation of the therapeutic index. The Phase I study containing the additional cohort is now expected to read out in the first half of next year. 
In neuropsychiatry, last month, Sage Therapeutics released an interim analysis of the ongoing open-label Phase III SHORELINE naturalistic study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder. The data showed that in the completed 30 milligram zuranolone cohort, approximately 70% of participants with a positive response to an initial 2-week treatment required at most 1 additional zuranolone treatment during the 1-year study. SHORELINE also showed that following the 2-week treatment, more than 70% of patients in the 30 milligram cohort and 80% of patients in the 50 milligram cohort achieved a positive response as evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression. 
In both the 30 and 50 milligram cohorts, zuranolone demonstrated an adverse event profile consistent with previously reported data. Adverse events, including somnolence, dizziness and sedation, were observed to be more frequent in the 50 milligram cohort, but were similar in severity to events seen with the 30 milligram treatment of zuranolone. We believe these data further supports the potential therapeutic effect of zuranolone, and we look forward to the readout of the WATERFALL study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder anticipated later this quarter. 
Next, I would like to turn to movement disorders. In collaboration with Sage, we recently announced that SAGE-324, also known as BIIB124, met the primary end point of a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the upper limb tremor score on prespecified components of The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale, or TETRAS, at day 29. This corresponded to a 36% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving BIIB124 compared to a 21% reduction with placebo. BIIB124 also demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previously reported data. 
This trial was designed to test the higher -- the high end of the dose range established in Phase I studies, 60 milligrams, in an effort to determine whether or not proof of concept could be established in essential tremor. BIIB124 clearly shows efficacy in essential tremor. But at this dose, the incidence of somnolence was 68% with 62% of patients going to a lower dose and 38% of patients discontinuing treatment. We are working closely with Sage to plan next steps for the development of BIIB124.
The unmet need in tremor, essential tremor, is significant. There have been no new drugs approved for essential tremor in more than 5 decades. The drugs currently used to treat essential tremor have tolerability issues of their own, which limits their use in clinical practice. We believe more can be done to help patients with this most common movement disorder that interferes with activities of daily living and hamper social engagement. 
In Parkinson's disease, the Phase I and Phase Ib studies of BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor, are now complete, and the safety and biomarker goals were achieved, which we believe support continued development of BIIB122. As previously announced with our collaboration partner, Denali, we expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
Our R&D organization delivered a number of important milestones in the first quarter of the year. We believe there is much to be excited about with 7 additional readouts expected by the end of the year, including pivotal readouts in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS and choroideremia. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."
29726,710875286,2255474,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from TECFIDERA U.S. generics and COVID-19 as we continue to execute well across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial c",1349,"Thank you, Al. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from TECFIDERA U.S. generics and COVID-19 as we continue to execute well across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and share with you an update to our full year guidance for 2021. 
Total revenue for the first quarter of $2.7 billion declined 24% versus the prior year at actual currency and 25% at constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the United States. 
Total MS revenue for the first quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.7 billion, decreased 26% versus the prior year at both actual and at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, were relatively flat, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the first quarter of $479 million declined 56% versus the prior year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $317 million declined 2% versus the prior year. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately $28 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue outside the U.S. increased 7%, with continued patient growth.
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $74 million in the first quarter and is now the #1 MS oral product in terms of new prescription share in the U.S.
TYSABRI first quarter global revenue of $503 million declined 4% versus the prior year. As a reminder, in Q1 of 2020, TYSABRI revenue benefited by approximately $40 million due to a combination of extra shipping days in the U.S. and a pricing adjustment in Italy. Normalizing for these dynamics, revenue grew 4% year-over-year, as we saw a 5% increase in global TYSABRI patients. We continue to believe TYSABRI is well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progress several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $521 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 12% at constant currency, although we were pleased to see 5% growth in global SPINRAZA patients versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 37% versus the prior year, as we continued to see impact from competition, exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, including approximately $40 million due to timing of shipments in Q1 of 2021. 
Moving now to our biosimilars business. First quarter revenue of $205 million decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 13% at constant currency. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately $15 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue was flat year-over-year. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continued to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe, and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the first quarter of $389 million decreased 25% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 50% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 29% increase in OCREVUS royalties. We expect continued erosion of RITUXAN due to biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue, down versus 83% in the prior quarter and down versus 87% in Q1 of 2020. The continued reduction in gross margin was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. We expect to continue to experience downward pressure on gross margins. 
Moving to expenses and the balance sheet. First quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $514 million. First quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $595 million, including approximately $75 million related to the launch preparations for aducanumab, net of reimbursement from Eisai. In the first quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 17% in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for $600 million. As of March 31, 2021, there was $4 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020, and we expect to utilize a portion of this throughout the remainder of the year. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 152 million shares for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $5.34. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $93 million and free cash flow was approximately $676 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt and $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, resulting in $3.9 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. Our full year 2021 revenue guidance remains at $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion, despite unfavorable currency dynamics, which I will explain in a moment. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17 to $18.50 to a range of between $17.50 to $19. Our capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million. 
This financial guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. It is important to note that we are reaffirming our revenue guidance despite an expected currency headwind of approximately $80 million net of hedging activities to our full year 2021 revenue guidance, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021. 
Our guidance continues to assume that aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, 2021, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. And as a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. 
We continued to expect rapid erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business as well as significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. We expect that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in Q1 2021 was 82% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic. 
We now expect full year non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will increase beginning in the second quarter due to new collaborations, program readouts and aducanumab investments as we prepare for the potential launch. 
Our full year SG&A estimate continues to include an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A.
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions in our guidance. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

And we believe we remain on track to make 2021 a transformative year for the company. This, of course, starts with the potential approval of aducanumab in the U.S. 
The unmet need and cost to society for Alzheimer's disease are tremendous and mounting. Alzheimer's creates a cost burden of over $600 billion per year in the U.S. and the costs for caring for an Alzheimer's patient can be over $0.5 million. Alzheimer's deprives many patients of their independence. By the age of 80, approximately 75% of people with Alzheimer's disease live in a nursing home at a per patient cost of approximately $100,000 per year. The potential approval of aducanumab will be an unprecedented milestones for patients, their families and society at large. 
Beyond aducanumab, we continue to advance our neuroscience pipeline as we work to create a multi-franchise portfolio. We look forward to the 7 expected mid- to late-stage readouts this year across a range of therapeutic areas, such as Alzheimer's disease, ALS, ophthalmology, depression and stroke, including 4 in Phase III.  
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively, while maintaining operational discipline and managing costs. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for super returns from the investment we make.
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we work with purpose to advance science to address the urgent and long-term challenge facing humanity. Now more than ever, we continued to strengthen environmental, social and governance priorities across the company. To underscore this commitment, we have decided to incorporate an ESG metric into our corporate scorecard to help ensure that we accelerate actions across these critical issues. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated the dedication to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physician caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. We are living through challenging times with COVID-19, and our achievements could not be realized without passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions."

I mean the focus of the team since many months in the U.S. was, first, to identify and assist the sites of care in terms of infrastructure advice and processes, because we anticipate that there will be, if approved, a very large influx of patients. We know that the availability of specialists and diagnosis capabilities are a bottleneck, so we had to prepare the sites of cares. And we have worked all around the country in order to identify those. Today, we anticipate approximately 600 ready to treat, but many more are on the works.
So this was -- this work was managed by a cross-functional team. And obviously, we started with the medical engagement and scientific leadership. And we are pleased with where we are in terms of those sites and their ability to welcome the patients, to diagnose the patients, to dose the patients, to monitor the patients, including the fine processes such as formulary listing. Who is in charge of what? So the team has done a very thorough work, and I am pleased with the progress. Each time I review the operation in the U.S. and the launch readiness, we are bridging -- we are passing some new milestones. 
I am also pleased with the digital capability. That is an overlay of rich contact and awareness building towards different stakeholders, not only the physicians, but also the patients and patient services.
As you know, so far, neither PET or CSF amyloid are reimbursed in the U.S. CSF is reimbursed in Europe, not in the U.S., but we believe there is a path forward. 
Concerning price, I think that we are there, Mike. We have done a thorough engagement with different stakeholders, considering the burden of the disease and the clinical meaningfulness that aducanumab will bring. And we have engaged with pharmacoeconomics, including ICER, many times and others in the U.S. and beyond. So I think that the team is ready, and I'm pleased with the progress. 
And actually, the 3 months addition were like a gift for the team because we are never fully ready for such a launch. And I must also appreciate the collaboration from Eisai in this launch readiness."

And so there are a lot of learning that are coming from the U.S. to apply to Europe and ex Europe. We can see a very strong resilience in core European markets. And we can see a very fast momentum of growth in the emerging geographies. So all in all, I am very pleased.
I think that, moving forward, with the pandemia improving with the rate of vaccination, the fear to visit institution will gradually decrease. And the SUNFISH 2 data continues to reinforce the said thesis that basically, the product is not that efficacious for the toddlers above the age of 5. The dose limitation, because of all the reasons that we all know, basically set the limit in terms of efficacy, while the weight of the young adult or toddler or young adult increase, which is the largest part of the market and where we have faced some switches.
So obviously, the learning from the U.S. will benefit probably ex U.S. in an environment where we should have less of the pandemia. I am pleased with the emerging economies where rare diseases were not the priority for so long, and nowadays are on the agenda in terms of resource allocation. So very good momentum.
Concerning TECFIDERA in China, it's a second product approved in China for Biogen, and I am delighted about that. As you know, I was posted there for my previous company during 4 years with my family. And I fundamentally believe into the long-term potential of this market, that is already the #2 in the world. So the demand is tremendous. And epidemiology is rapidly emerging with similarities with the one of the west.
So incidence is lower for MS, but there are still more than 100,000 patients. The rate of diagnosis and the rate of treatment with DMTs is extremely low. It's less than 5% of the market. So disabilities are high, and it gives a great opportunity to establish TECFIDERA, together with the rest of the portfolio with a bit more time hopefully. 
China is an important market for Biogen. We are managing Asia-Pac without Japan from China. We have partnered with a Chinese company on a biosimilar. So it's an invest geography. Obviously, we don't lose the focus on the rest. But good momentum in China. We have a great team, more than 200 people. And it's only the beginning. Thank you for the questions."

About 70% needed at most 1 additional treatment for an entire year. So I think that both kinds of durability are important."

And we will continue to buy back stock and utilize a portion of the remaining $4 billion authorization throughout the rest of the year, as we said. 
If you look back 5 years, Biogen's repurchased something on the order of 71 million shares for a total value of about $20 billion. And I would say that we've certainly availed ourselves of a great opportunity there. And I think that you do have to differentiate levels of cash flow prior to the entry of generics for TECFIDERA. Obviously, that was a highly profitable product, with a large revenue base in the U.S. that's now eroding pretty rapidly. So we don't have the level of free cash flow that we had prior to that. 
But with that said, we still do have a meaningful amount of cash with $3.4 billion on hand at the end of the quarter. And we remain very committed to share repurchases. There is a differential, obviously, in the level of free cash flow. And we had a lot of excess cash on hand during various periods of time, even more than we have now prior to the generic situation. 
So within the confines of what we can do, we remain very committed. $600 million is still a pretty meaningful number, and we will continue to evaluate a very robust pipeline of BD opportunities. We will continue to invest in those. You probably saw that we announced an investment in a biosimilar opportunity with Bio-Thera that we're excited about. And we will continue to repurchase shares, and we have the wherewithal to do that. So I wouldn't read too much into to the volume as being a sign that we're not committed to it because we're something -- it's something that we continue to see as a very accretive investment."

And you're right. I mean the Roche negative results do make us think that it's tough to target tau with an antibody. But we remain hopeful. We haven't seen the data from our own Phase II results yet. It's a large study, 650-plus patients testing several doses. And we're testing it in the early stages of Alzheimer's. So I think it's a robust study that will enable a very good go, no-go decision to Phase III.
I did mention BIIB080 in my prepared comments because it's a different approach to tau. It's using an antisense to decrease the production of tau. And it should affect both intracellular and extracellular forms of tau, very different approach. And we're excited about the results that we found in Phase I in terms of dose and time-dependent reduction in tau expression as seen in the CSF.

And in the Phase III trial, most of the -- almost all the monitoring was done within the first year of treatment because the risk of ARIA goes down with time as you -- the longer you treat, the less likely you are to get ARIA-E. And I believe we had 6 or 9 scans in the trial. We don't think that you'll need that many. We were being extra cautious in our Phase III trial. Exactly how many we'll need will obviously depend on our discussions if we get to them or when we get to them in terms of the label, which we don't have yet. 
I would remind you that most of the ARIA-E is -- were asymptomatic. I'd say about 2/3 were asymptomatic.

That's a major result. The obvious thing to do now since we tested the high end of the dose range is to see whether we can reduce the dose, mitigate some of the adverse events while maintaining efficacy. There may be other maneuvers, such as changing the dosing algorithm, if you will, perhaps easing up to a dose, titrating. And other approaches would include potentially looking at key subgroups.
In terms of what's acceptable, I think that's a very tough thing to answer definitively. I think that every patient looks at the benefit they're receiving from a drug and the tolerability issues they have to accept with the drug. It's probably a day-to-day decision that patients make. And in this situation, they can see themselves how -- what's going on with the tremor.

And with the data we generate and the extended interval dose, and hopefully, the data with the NOVA study midyear readout, we should really shed light on the optimal dose and most frequence of the treatment. 
Subcu is an opportunity to enlarge the target. When we look at the prescribers landscape for TYSABRI, which is a tremendous success, it's extremely limited. And is it because of the infusion centers? Is it because of the risk of PML? Probably both. Here, we are combining the opportunity of accessing high efficacy with a subcutaneous dosing.

With a strong focus on operational execution, we have continued to serve patients and advance our strategic priorities. While we know that 2021 will be a financial restructure for the company, we are pleased with our operational performance during Q1, with first quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion and first quarter non-GAAP EPS of $5.34. These results were driven by solid performance across MS, SMA and biosimilars, together with continued strong cost management. 
We are ready to launch aducanumab in the U.S. should we receive the regulatory approval, and we anticipate an FDA decision by the June 7 PDUFA date. If approved, aducanumab will be the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer's disease and will represent a significant growth and value creation opportunity. 
Our cross-functional team in the U.S. has been working for months in preparation for the potential launch of aducanumab. We have identified and evaluated key sites of care that have the necessary infrastructure for Alzheimer's patients. We believe that more than 600 of these sites will be ready to treat patients shortly after a potential approval. Our team is currently working to evaluate the capacity at these and other sites to absorb an influx of Alzheimer's patients. 
Together with Eisai, we were pleased to support UsAgainstAlzheimer's in the development of BrainGuide, a platform which is powered by Amazon Web Services. BrainGuide aims to increase brain health awareness and empower people to take action based upon responses to a memory questionnaire. We hope that BrainGuide, along with our collaboration with Apple aiming to identify digital biomarkers of cognitive health, will enable people to seek care sooner in order to maximize the benefits of treatment. 
We are also working to ensure an equitable launch to facilitate broad access to aducanumab, should it be approved, including underserved population, a critical issue that has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pleased to announce that outside the U.S., we recently submitted additional regulatory filings in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Australia, adding to our earlier submissions in Europe and Japan. 
Turning to our progress towards our strategic priorities. First, Q1 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.7 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience and progress. Excluding TECFIDERA in the U.S., the number of patients on our MS products worldwide increased approximately 5% versus the prior year. Importantly, in the current COVID-19 environment, we believe our MS products are well positioned versus the competition based on our current treatment guidelines. 
We were very pleased to see strong revenue growth for VUMERITY, which is now the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescription in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to a strong product profile and our team's ability to execute well, validating our plan announced mid last year to accelerate the launch of VUMERITY. We are also excited that TECFIDERA recently received regulatory approval in China. 
Furthermore, we continue to advance new approaches to help address the remaining unmet medical need in MS. This quarter, we launched an intramuscular formulation of PLEGRIDY in both the U.S. and EU, which we believe offers an improved tolerability profile. And we obtained approval for subcutaneous administration of TYSABRI in the EU with the first expected launch in Germany, while we await a regulatory decision in the U.S. We also continue to advance the potential use of extended interval dosing for TYSABRI with important data expected in the middle of this year. 
Second, SPINRAZA generated first quarter global revenues of $521 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation decreased versus Q4 of last year. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA continued to perform very well with 13% revenue growth versus Q1 of last year. Overall, SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA, and we believe it will remain a foundation of care. 
Third, our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $205 million. We are pleased with this performance as the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slowdown in new treatment starts and reduced clinic capacity for immunology patients in Europe. 
We aim to continue to grow our biosimilars business and create additional financial headroom for innovation by launching new products. To that end, we recently announced a collaboration with Bio-Thera Solutions to develop and commercialize BAT1806, a proposed biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, currently in Phase III development. Biogen will have the right to commercialize BAT1806 globally in countries outside of China, which will expand our global biosimilars footprint. 
Fourth, this quarter, we continue to meaningfully progress on our pipeline. We reported Phase II data in essential tremor, and we expect 7 additional mid- to late-stage results this year. Gene therapy represents a key area of focus for Biogen as we continue to pursue multiple modalities. To this end, we recently announced our plan to build a new state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facility at our RTP site in North Carolina. 
Fifth, our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant flexibility. To allocate capital in Q1, we generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations and $676 million in free cash flow. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to maximizing returns for our shareholders as we aim to bring innovative therapies to patients. 
I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D."

As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. We achieved a number of key milestones this quarter, and we look forward to 7 additional readouts anticipated this year, including pivotal trials in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS and choroideremia. Let me now turn to the advances we made across our pipeline in the first quarter. 
Starting with Alzheimer's disease. As Michel mentioned, this quarter, we submitted additional regulatory filings for aducanumab in Brazil, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. Together with our prior filings in the U.S., EU and Japan, we have now submitted filings in 7 key geographies and continue to engage with regulators as they review the aducanumab data. 
Turning to lecanemab, or BAN2401, our collaboration partner, Eisai, has recently enrolled the last patient in the Phase III Clarity study in early Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to the readout in Q3 of next year. Additionally, we plan to present detailed results from the Phase Ib study of BIIB080 in mild Alzheimer's disease at the upcoming AAIC meeting later this year. BIIB080 is a tau-targeted antisense oligonucleotide that aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intracellular and extracellular. The Phase Ib study demonstrated that BIIB080 was generally well tolerated and resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction from baseline in CSF total tau and phospho-tau with durability of effect. We are currently finalizing plans to advance BIIB080 into a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. 
Moving to MS. We are presenting new data across our portfolio at the AA (sic) [ AAN ] meeting this week. An updated analysis of data from the TOUCH Prescribing Program of TYSABRI showed an 88% reduction in the risk of PML when used with extended interval dosing or EID as compared with standard interval dosing. This supports previous findings that showed that EID is associated with a lower incidence of PML. 
We continue to generate state-of-the-art real-world data through MS PATHS. In MS PATHS, Biogen is collaborating with 10 leading MS centers in the U.S. and Europe to generate standardized, quantitative data from a diverse MS patient population as they are being seen in the clinic. More than 17,000 patients have been enrolled in MS PATHS to date, and we aim to use quantitative measurements across a range of key clinical dimensions, high position MRI measurements of MS disease activity, patient-reported data using a validated quality of life instrument, blood biomarkers such as neurofilament and electronic health records to obtain a more holistic view of MS and gain insights on how currently approved drugs are affecting real-world outcomes. Moreover, with the use of modern analytical methods such as machine learning, we hope to make new discoveries about the key subtypes and stages of MS as well as its pathogenesis. 
At the AAN meeting, we are showing data from the MS PATHS that showed that extended interval dosing of TYSABRI may maintain comparable efficacy to standard interval dosing as assessed by the rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions on MRI scans, quantified by advanced image analysis software, which we developed in collaboration with Siemens. A prospective study of the efficacy of extended interval dosing is being assessed in the ongoing NOVA study from which we expect top line results around midyear. 
Also being presented at AAN, another study leveraging data collected using MS PATHS demonstrated that TYSABRI can lead to clinically meaningful improvements in aspects of mental and social health, as assessed by the Neuro-QoL, a validated instrument that evaluates physical, mental and social effects reported by patients with neurological disorders. For 11 of the 12 domains tested, the adjusted rate of improvement was greater for patients treated with TYSABRI than for those treated with OCREVUS. 
Also being presented at AAN is the first real-world analysis of VUMERITY-treated patients. The retrospective study of 160 patients found that overall persistence was high, with 88% of individuals remaining on VUMERITY at 8 months, and that treatment discontinuation due to GI adverse events was low at 3.8%. And these results follow a recent publication of EVOLVE-MS-2, a Phase III, 5-week randomized multicenter study that assessed the GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA using self-administered questionnaires. The study demonstrated that only 9.5% of VUMERITY-treated patients indicated that GI symptoms interfered quite a bit or extremely with regular activities as compared to almost 29% of TECFIDERA patients. We believe that the differentiated tolerability profile of VUMERITY will lead to improved adherence to therapy. 
In addition to our established treatments, we aim to leverage our MS pipeline to address the remaining unmet need in MS. This includes our oral remyelination program, BIIB061, our oral BTK inhibitor BIIB091, as well as our next-generation anti-VLA-4 antibody that seeks to build on the success of TYSABRI in the high efficacy space. 
Turning to neuromuscular disorders. We are presenting an update on the ongoing DEVOTE study, testing a higher dose of SPINRAZA at the AAN meeting this week. Data from the patients enrolled in the Part A open-label safety evaluation cohort, followed for up to approximately five months, were consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of the currently approved 12 milligram dose of SPINRAZA. The emerging safety profile of the higher dose supports its continued development as we evaluate the potential for greater efficacy. 
We also added an additional cohort to the Phase I study of BIIB078, our C9orf ASO for ALS. Safety data has been supportive of escalating the dose, enabling us to conduct a more complete evaluation of the therapeutic index. The Phase I study containing the additional cohort is now expected to read out in the first half of next year. 
In neuropsychiatry, last month, Sage Therapeutics released an interim analysis of the ongoing open-label Phase III SHORELINE naturalistic study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder. The data showed that in the completed 30 milligram zuranolone cohort, approximately 70% of participants with a positive response to an initial 2-week treatment required at most 1 additional zuranolone treatment during the 1-year study. SHORELINE also showed that following the 2-week treatment, more than 70% of patients in the 30 milligram cohort and 80% of patients in the 50 milligram cohort achieved a positive response as evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression. 
In both the 30 and 50 milligram cohorts, zuranolone demonstrated an adverse event profile consistent with previously reported data. Adverse events, including somnolence, dizziness and sedation, were observed to be more frequent in the 50 milligram cohort, but were similar in severity to events seen with the 30 milligram treatment of zuranolone. We believe these data further supports the potential therapeutic effect of zuranolone, and we look forward to the readout of the WATERFALL study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder anticipated later this quarter. 
Next, I would like to turn to movement disorders. In collaboration with Sage, we recently announced that SAGE-324, also known as BIIB124, met the primary end point of a statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the upper limb tremor score on prespecified components of The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale, or TETRAS, at day 29. This corresponded to a 36% reduction from baseline in upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving BIIB124 compared to a 21% reduction with placebo. BIIB124 also demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previously reported data. 
This trial was designed to test the higher -- the high end of the dose range established in Phase I studies, 60 milligrams, in an effort to determine whether or not proof of concept could be established in essential tremor. BIIB124 clearly shows efficacy in essential tremor. But at this dose, the incidence of somnolence was 68% with 62% of patients going to a lower dose and 38% of patients discontinuing treatment. We are working closely with Sage to plan next steps for the development of BIIB124.
The unmet need in tremor, essential tremor, is significant. There have been no new drugs approved for essential tremor in more than 5 decades. The drugs currently used to treat essential tremor have tolerability issues of their own, which limits their use in clinical practice. We believe more can be done to help patients with this most common movement disorder that interferes with activities of daily living and hamper social engagement. 
In Parkinson's disease, the Phase I and Phase Ib studies of BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor, are now complete, and the safety and biomarker goals were achieved, which we believe support continued development of BIIB122. As previously announced with our collaboration partner, Denali, we expect to initiate late-stage clinical development in Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year. 
Our R&D organization delivered a number of important milestones in the first quarter of the year. We believe there is much to be excited about with 7 additional readouts expected by the end of the year, including pivotal readouts in major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, ALS and choroideremia. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."
29726,710875286,2255485,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from TECFIDERA U.S. generics and COVID-19 as we continue to execute well across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial c",1349,"Thank you, Al. Biogen had another solid quarter despite the challenges from TECFIDERA U.S. generics and COVID-19 as we continue to execute well across our core businesses. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to continue to grow the business over the long term. I will now review our financial performance for the quarter and share with you an update to our full year guidance for 2021. 
Total revenue for the first quarter of $2.7 billion declined 24% versus the prior year at actual currency and 25% at constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the United States. 
Total MS revenue for the first quarter, including OCREVUS royalties of $1.7 billion, decreased 26% versus the prior year at both actual and at constant currency. This decline was also driven by the continued impact of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S. Excluding U.S. TECFIDERA, total MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, were relatively flat, demonstrating the resilience of our MS business in a competitive market. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the first quarter of $479 million declined 56% versus the prior year. Outside of the U.S., first quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $317 million declined 2% versus the prior year. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately $28 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue outside the U.S. increased 7%, with continued patient growth.
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in VUMERITY trends. VUMERITY revenue was $74 million in the first quarter and is now the #1 MS oral product in terms of new prescription share in the U.S.
TYSABRI first quarter global revenue of $503 million declined 4% versus the prior year. As a reminder, in Q1 of 2020, TYSABRI revenue benefited by approximately $40 million due to a combination of extra shipping days in the U.S. and a pricing adjustment in Italy. Normalizing for these dynamics, revenue grew 4% year-over-year, as we saw a 5% increase in global TYSABRI patients. We continue to believe TYSABRI is well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS as we progress several important initiatives, including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. 
Moving now to SMA. Global first quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $521 million decreased 8% versus the prior year at actual currency and 12% at constant currency, although we were pleased to see 5% growth in global SPINRAZA patients versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 37% versus the prior year, as we continued to see impact from competition, exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, including approximately $40 million due to timing of shipments in Q1 of 2021. 
Moving now to our biosimilars business. First quarter revenue of $205 million decreased 6% versus the prior year at actual currency and 13% at constant currency. Normalizing for accelerated shipments due to COVID-19 of approximately $15 million in Q1 of 2020, revenue was flat year-over-year. Our biosimilars business continues to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to COVID-19. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we continued to be the leading anti-TNF biosimilar provider in Europe, and BENEPALI continues to be the #1 prescribed etanercept product across Europe. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow in Europe as well as within the U.S. and other geographies by commercializing new products. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the first quarter of $389 million decreased 25% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 50% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 29% increase in OCREVUS royalties. We expect continued erosion of RITUXAN due to biosimilars. 
Turning now to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue, down versus 83% in the prior quarter and down versus 87% in Q1 of 2020. The continued reduction in gross margin was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. We expect to continue to experience downward pressure on gross margins. 
Moving to expenses and the balance sheet. First quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $514 million. First quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $595 million, including approximately $75 million related to the launch preparations for aducanumab, net of reimbursement from Eisai. In the first quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 17% in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for $600 million. As of March 31, 2021, there was $4 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020, and we expect to utilize a portion of this throughout the remainder of the year. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 152 million shares for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $5.34. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $769 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $93 million and free cash flow was approximately $676 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt and $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, resulting in $3.9 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. Our full year 2021 revenue guidance remains at $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion, despite unfavorable currency dynamics, which I will explain in a moment. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17 to $18.50 to a range of between $17.50 to $19. Our capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million. 
This financial guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. It is important to note that we are reaffirming our revenue guidance despite an expected currency headwind of approximately $80 million net of hedging activities to our full year 2021 revenue guidance, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1, 2021, through March 31, 2021. 
Our guidance continues to assume that aducanumab will be approved in the U.S. by June 7, 2021, although uncertainty remains on the FDA's decision. If aducanumab is approved in the U.S., we would expect an immediate launch. However, dose titration will result in less revenue per patient in the initial months of treatment. And as a result, we would expect only modest revenue for aducanumab in 2021, ramping thereafter. 
We continued to expect rapid erosion of our U.S. TECFIDERA business as well as significant erosion of RITUXAN in the U.S. We expect that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in Q1 2021 was 82% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic. 
We now expect full year non-GAAP R&D expenses will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will increase beginning in the second quarter due to new collaborations, program readouts and aducanumab investments as we prepare for the potential launch. 
Our full year SG&A estimate continues to include an approximate $600 million investment in support of the potential launch of aducanumab. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and would be reflected as collaboration profit sharing post commercialization and not part of SG&A.
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $4 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions in our guidance. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

And we believe we remain on track to make 2021 a transformative year for the company. This, of course, starts with the potential approval of aducanumab in the U.S. 
The unmet need and cost to society for Alzheimer's disease are tremendous and mounting. Alzheimer's creates a cost burden of over $600 billion per year in the U.S. and the costs for caring for an Alzheimer's patient can be over $0.5 million. Alzheimer's deprives many patients of their independence. By the age of 80, approximately 75% of people with Alzheimer's disease live in a nursing home at a per patient cost of approximately $100,000 per year. The potential approval of aducanumab will be an unprecedented milestones for patients, their families and society at large. 
Beyond aducanumab, we continue to advance our neuroscience pipeline as we work to create a multi-franchise portfolio. We look forward to the 7 expected mid- to late-stage readouts this year across a range of therapeutic areas, such as Alzheimer's disease, ALS, ophthalmology, depression and stroke, including 4 in Phase III.  
I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term. This demands that we continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively, while maintaining operational discipline and managing costs. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for super returns from the investment we make.
Lastly, I would like to reflect upon Biogen's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility. Our dedication to patients and the broader society is not only limited to developing novel therapeutics for patients suffering from serious diseases, but extends much further. At Biogen, we work with purpose to advance science to address the urgent and long-term challenge facing humanity. Now more than ever, we continued to strengthen environmental, social and governance priorities across the company. To underscore this commitment, we have decided to incorporate an ESG metric into our corporate scorecard to help ensure that we accelerate actions across these critical issues. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated the dedication to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physician caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. We are living through challenging times with COVID-19, and our achievements could not be realized without passion and commitment. We will now open the call for questions."

I mean the focus of the team since many months in the U.S. was, first, to identify and assist the sites of care in terms of infrastructure advice and processes, because we anticipate that there will be, if approved, a very large influx of patients. We know that the availability of specialists and diagnosis capabilities are a bottleneck, so we had to prepare the sites of cares. And we have worked all around the country in order to identify those. Today, we anticipate approximately 600 ready to treat, but many more are on the works.
So this was -- this work was managed by a cross-functional team. And obviously, we started with the medical engagement and scientific leadership. And we are pleased with where we are in terms of those sites and their ability to welcome the patients, to diagnose the patients, to dose the patients, to monitor the patients, including the fine processes such as formulary listing. Who is in charge of what? So the team has done a very thorough work, and I am pleased with the progress. Each time I review the operation in the U.S. and the launch readiness, we are bridging -- we are passing some new milestones. 
I am also pleased with the digital capability. That is an overlay of rich contact and awareness building towards different stakeholders, not only the physicians, but also the patients and patient services.
As you know, so far, neither PET or CSF amyloid are reimbursed in the U.S. CSF is reimbursed in Europe, not in the U.S., but we believe there is a path forward. 
Concerning price, I think that we are there, Mike. We have done a thorough engagement with different stakeholders, considering the burden of the disease and the clinical meaningfulness that aducanumab will bring. And we have engaged with pharmacoeconomics, including ICER, many times and others in the U.S. and beyond. So I think that the team is ready, and I'm pleased with the progress. 
And actually, the 3 months addition were like a gift for the team because we are never fully ready for such a launch. And I must also appreciate the collaboration from Eisai in this launch readiness."

And so there are a lot of learning that are coming from the U.S. to apply to Europe and ex Europe. We can see a very strong resilience in core European markets. And we can see a very fast momentum of growth in the emerging geographies. So all in all, I am very pleased.
I think that, moving forward, with the pandemia improving with the rate of vaccination, the fear to visit institution will gradually decrease. And the SUNFISH 2 data continues to reinforce the said thesis that basically, the product is not that efficacious for the toddlers above the age of 5. The dose limitation, because of all the reasons that we all know, basically set the limit in terms of efficacy, while the weight of the young adult or toddler or young adult increase, which is the largest part of the market and where we have faced some switches.
So obviously, the learning from the U.S. will benefit probably ex U.S. in an environment where we should have less of the pandemia. I am pleased with the emerging economies where rare diseases were not the priority for so long, and nowadays are on the agenda in terms of resource allocation. So very good momentum.
Concerning TECFIDERA in China, it's a second product approved in China for Biogen, and I am delighted about that. As you know, I was posted there for my previous company during 4 years with my family. And I fundamentally believe into the long-term potential of this market, that is already the #2 in the world. So the demand is tremendous. And epidemiology is rapidly emerging with similarities with the one of the west.
So incidence is lower for MS, but there are still more than 100,000 patients. The rate of diagnosis and the rate of treatment with DMTs is extremely low. It's less than 5% of the market. So disabilities are high, and it gives a great opportunity to establish TECFIDERA, together with the rest of the portfolio with a bit more time hopefully. 
China is an important market for Biogen. We are managing Asia-Pac without Japan from China. We have partnered with a Chinese company on a biosimilar. So it's an invest geography. Obviously, we don't lose the focus on the rest. But good momentum in China. We have a great team, more than 200 people. And it's only the beginning. Thank you for the questions."

And it's -- there's 2 ways to look at that. One is, does it stay separated from placebo? Or perhaps, more importantly, what happens between day 15 and day 42 on the efficacy on the HAM-D score in the treated patients? And so I think that if you look at prior precedents, the latter is probably more important than the former. But I think both will need to be looked at.
And then, of course, the key durability comes from the data from SHORELINE, which shows that the patients who responded to the initial course of treatment need at most one additional treatment. About 70% needed at most 1 additional treatment for an entire year. So I think that both kinds of durability are important."

I would say that we did buy back $600 million in the quarter. And we continue to be very committed to our share repurchase program, and we continue to see our stock as a very accretive investment. And we will continue to buy back stock and utilize a portion of the remaining $4 billion authorization throughout the rest of the year, as we said. 
If you look back 5 years, Biogen's repurchased something on the order of 71 million shares for a total value of about $20 billion. And I would say that we've certainly availed ourselves of a great opportunity there. And I think that you do have to differentiate levels of cash flow prior to the entry of generics for TECFIDERA. Obviously, that was a highly profitable product, with a large revenue base in the U.S. that's now eroding pretty rapidly. So we don't have the level of free cash flow that we had prior to that. 
But with that said, we still do have a meaningful amount of cash with $3.4 billion on hand at the end of the quarter. And we remain very committed to share repurchases. There is a differential, obviously, in the level of free cash flow. And we had a lot of excess cash on hand during various periods of time, even more than we have now prior to the generic situation. 
So within the confines of what we can do, we remain very committed. $600 million is still a pretty meaningful number, and we will continue to evaluate a very robust pipeline of BD opportunities. We will continue to invest in those. You probably saw that we announced an investment in a biosimilar opportunity with Bio-Thera that we're excited about. And we will continue to repurchase shares, and we have the wherewithal to do that. So I wouldn't read too much into to the volume as being a sign that we're not committed to it because we're something -- it's something that we continue to see as a very accretive investment."

That's a major result. The obvious thing to do now since we tested the high end of the dose range is to see whether we can reduce the dose, mitigate some of the adverse events while maintaining efficacy. There may be other maneuvers, such as changing the dosing algorithm, if you will, perhaps easing up to a dose, titrating. And other approaches would include potentially looking at key subgroups.
In terms of what's acceptable, I think that's a very tough thing to answer definitively. I think that every patient looks at the benefit they're receiving from a drug and the tolerability issues they have to accept with the drug. It's probably a day-to-day decision that patients make.

Subcu is an opportunity to enlarge the target. When we look at the prescribers landscape for TYSABRI, which is a tremendous success, it's extremely limited. And is it because of the infusion centers? Is it because of the risk of PML? Probably both. Here, we are combining the opportunity of accessing high efficacy with a subcutaneous dosing.

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surroun",1908,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surrounding the recent approval of Aduhelm. 
We are cognizant of the key issues raised by the community and are working to provide additional clarity through the following goals: exploring all options to maximize patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity; educating on the updated label language, which I will discuss; publishing our Phase III results in a peer reviewed journal and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA; expediting the execution of the Phase IV confirmatory study; and leveraging the unique data generation opportunity we have with EMBARK, the longest and most comprehensive longitudinal study for an Alzheimer's disease therapy. 
Biogen stands behind our clinical data from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients that supported accelerated approval. As the FDA's current chief stated publicly earlier this month, Aduhelm was approved appropriately on very solid grounds and represented the right thing to do for the patients. 
I want to be clear that Biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process. Respectful dialogue between the industry and regulators is standard and essential to advance the understanding of the therapeutic data driving innovation, as demonstrated more recently by the COVID-19 vaccines development programs of last year. 
We believe the accelerated approval pathway has transformed the treatment of oncology, and now has the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the concerns about the price, and are committed to ensure sustainability of the system and maximizing access for patients. 
Without access, every day that passes, we estimate that approximately 1,000 Americans move from the early stage of Alzheimer's to moderate or severe dementia, and therefore, may no longer be appropriate for an any session of treatment with Aduhelm. This is why we are working with a sense of urgency to engage with the community, with payers, with CMS and with policymakers to discuss potential innovative approaches, with the goal of ensuring the price does not represent access issues for patients. 
With that said, I would like to focus on the fundamentals. Another quarter with solid underlying financial performance that exceeded our expectation, the accelerated approval of Aduhelm for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and key readouts across our diversified portfolio. 
First, the accelerated approval of Aduhelm represents the first new therapy for Alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years. 
Biogen has a deep history of building new markets and delivering innovative and impactful therapies to patients in need. We pioneered it and currently maintain the market-leading portfolio of therapies for MS. We delivered the first approved and market-leading therapy for SMA. Now with Aduhelm, we have the first approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which we believe represents a significant value creation opportunity for years to come. 
To lead us in successfully executing on our long-term leadership strategy, I am pleased to announce that Rashid Isar will be head of our newly created Alzheimer's disease and dementia business unit and will join the Executive Committee of Biogen. Rashid is currently in charge of Biogen's intercontinental region and our biosimilars business unit. His experience across multiple geographies and global position will serve us well as he works to maximize our potential impact on the lives of people living with this devastating disease. 
We have seen strong indications of very high initial patient interest in Aduhelm as well as increased referrals from PCPs to specialists. However, it will take some time for sites to get up and running. While some large centers have said they will refrain for now for administering adherent to patients, many other sites are moving forward with internal processes, such as pharmacy and therapeutics or P&T committee review, with some accelerating faster than we had originally planned. 
Of the 900 sites approximately, which we expected to be ready shortly after approval, we estimate that approximately 325 or 35% have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated that they won't require a P&T review. We have also seen some sites leverage external infusion centers if they face internal resistance or awaiting clarity on their facilities internal process. We continue to believe that, consistent with our clinical trials, most specialists will require confirmation of amyloid beta pathology, either via PET or CSF, which is also taking time to schedule and coordinate. 
In terms of reimbursement, it is still the early days, and I'm pleased to say that we have seen the first examples of Medicare Advantage plans approving pre-authorization. We welcome the recent opening of a national coverage determination analysis by CMS for monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid beta, including Aduhelm. We believe this process will provide additional clarity on coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and drive consistency of access across the country. We expect that regional Medicare administrative contractors and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage of our ad helm while the NCD analysis is underway. We believe that CMS's swift decision to initiate the NCD analysis is a testament to the large unmet need in Alzheimer's disease and the urgency to clarify access for patients. 
We obtained new label language for adu helm in July to clarify that treatment should be initiated in patients with microbit impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's dementia. This is the population studied in our clinical trials and where we generated clinical evidence, as stated in Section 14 of the Aduhelm label. This updated language aligns with our consistent expectation that Aduhelm will be prescribed mainly by specialists for patients in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. And this update has been well received by the community, including prescribers, payers and policymakers. 
Outside the U.S., we continued to engage with regulators regarding the ongoing review in Europe, Japan and other markets, while also continuing to submit new regulatory filing around the world. In addition, we are pursuing early access mechanisms wherever possible, including an early access program and a charge managed access program. We recognize that building a new market for Alzheimer's disease is an unprecedented undertaking. And that this is just the beginning of our journey as we aim to make Aduhelm and potentially lecanumab accessible to patients around the world. We believe our teams are well equipped to successfully execute on a well-defined strategy, aimed at long-term leadership for Biogen in Alzheimer's disease. 
Second, this quarter, our pipeline delivered meaningful mid- to late-stage results in key areas, including depression, stroke and biosimilars. The positive waterfall Phase III trial of zuranolone in major depressive disorder is a significant milestone towards bringing a differentiated potential treatment option to the 17 million patients suffering from depression in the U.S. alone. The observed rapid onset of benefit in as soon as 3 days, in addition to a differentiated tolerability profile and 2-week dosing regimen, underscore our belief that if approved, zuranolone would be a multibillion-dollar product. 
We were also excited to see positive data from the Phase IIa trial of TMS 07 in acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a second leading cause of death worldwide, and those who survived may suffer irreversible damage of the brain. We are highly encouraged by the results of the trial, and we immediately moved forward with executing the option to acquire TMS 07. Should both zuranolone and TMS 07 be approved, Biogen will be in a leadership position in offering novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, the #1 neurodegenerative disease depression, one of the most common mental health disorder, and stroke, a leading cause of neurologic disability. 
In addition to these results, we had a positive Phase III readout for our biosimilar referencing Actemra. With these positive results in hand, we begin to prepare for a regulatory filing. 
As with any company engaging in breakthrough science, we also had setbacks in some programs, including our anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and our gene therapy programs in ophthalmology. 
Third, we reported a solid quarter as we continued to execute well across our core business of MS, SMA and biosimilars. And we are pleased to be raising our revenue guidance for the year, which Mike will discuss. 
Q2 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.8 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience, with a 5% increase in patients worldwide. This performance underscore our ability to execute well. 
We were very pleased to see continued revenue growth for VUMERITY, which remains the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to VUMERITY's strong product profile. Given the progress of the VUMERITY launch to date, in addition to planned ex U.S. launches, we believe VUMERITY can reach over $1 billion in annual sales over time. 
We also continued to invest in new potential treatment to address the remaining unmet medical needs in -- for MS patients. Last week, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for orilabrutinib, an innovative CNS penetrant Phase II BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of all forms of MS. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. 
Next, SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $500 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation continued to decrease versus Q1 of this year. Total revenue in the U.S. was flat versus the prior quarter. And SPINRAZA continued to perform very well outside the U.S., with 23% revenue growth versus Q2 of last year. 
SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA. And we stand behind SPINRAZA's proven efficacy and well-established safety profile across all types of that SPINRAZA perceived efficacy among adult has improved over the past year and exceeds the efficacy perception for therapeutic alternatives, including risdiplam. Although we face near-term competitive pressure in SMA, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow over the medium to long term, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by overall market growth, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, continued data generation, particularly in older patients, and further geographic expansion. 
Our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $202 million this quarter. While we remain focused on executing against our currently marketed therapies, we also look to expand our portfolio, including our recent collaboration with Bioterra and a positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar referencing Lucentis. 
Fourth, we still have 2 key Phase III readouts anticipated in the remainder of 2021. This includes the Phase III study for tofersen, potentially the first genetically targeted therapy for ALS, as well as an additional Phase III for zuranolone in major depressive disorder. Given the incredible unmet medical need in ALS and encouraging results from the prior tofersen trial, we recently initiated an individual compassionate use program to provide tofersen to the most rapidly progressing patients suffering from SOD1 ALS. 
Taken together, these developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multifranchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas. 
I would like now to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D."

I'd like to start by saying a few words about aducanumab. 
The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path and the regulatory process in general. 
Since June 7, the FDA has made several clarifying statements on these topics. As always, we defer to the FDA as the lead voice on such matters. They are the independent regulatory body charged with weighing the data expertly and dispassionately in order to make critical decisions that have the potential to impact millions of people. 
But I thought it would be helpful to add our perspective about several of these topics, including our interactions with the agency. 
We are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aducanumab and the hope it brings to patients with Alzheimer's disease. We are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the FDA demonstrated during a very lengthy process. We therefore welcome a formal review into the interactions between FDA and Biogen on the path to the approval of aducanumab. A better understanding of the facts is good for everyone involved to assure confidence in both the therapy and the process by which it was approved. We will cooperate fully with the review even as we prioritize the issues that affect patients. 
I want to underscore that it is normal and appropriate for scientists and clinicians to discuss the data from experiments and clinical trials to debate and to disagree on the interpretation of the data. That is how science advances, and we welcome these discussions. However, I would like to correct some of the misinformation we have seen recently. 
First, several people have stated that all anti-amyloid antibodies clear amyloid from the brain. This is factually incorrect. First-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, such as bafunezumab and solanezumab, are not specific for aggregated forms of Abeta or target soluble monomeric Abeta, and crenezumab, being an IgG4, is deficient in effector function. As a result, these antibodies do not clear amyloid from the brain. 
This slide shows the amyloid PET imaging results from the peer-reviewed literature of these first-generation antibodies. 
Crenezumab and solanezumab had no significant difference from placebo on amyloid plaque burden. Bapineuzumab did show a significant difference from placebo in the Phase III trials, but this was largely driven by an unexplained increase in amyloid plaque burden in these placebo-treated patients in the mild to moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease. We believe this increase in amyloid plaque in placebo patients must have been a spurious result as we now know that plaque buildup reaches a maximum by the time the patients have mild cognitive impairment. 
In short, there is no evidence that the first-generation antibodies against Abeta actually removed amyloid plaque. There is no basis for using the failure of these antibodies as a reason not to approve aducanumab. 
We have also seen statements that all of aducanumab results are post hoc. That is also factually incorrect. The primary and secondary endpoints had been prespecified in the Phase III trial protocols and statistical analysis plans before the first patient was enrolled into the trials. The aducanumab label shows the results on these prespecified endpoints based on data that had already been collected at the sites by the time the trials were prematurely terminated on March 21, 2019. 
Separately, some have contended that ARIA led to unblinding. We took great care to ensure that the neurologists who assess the clinical outcome measures did not know about the occurrence of ARIA. One way in which we assured ourselves that unblinded -- unblinding did not affect the results was to examine the clinical outcomes after ARIA was seen. If ARIA had affected blinding, the results after ARIA might be expected to change. 
This slide shows that the results excluding data that have been obtained after ARIA events were the same as the overall results. Thus, we are confident that unblinding due to ARIA did not affect the results of the Phase III trials of aducanumab. 
And finally, some people have opined that the approval of aducanumab would inhibit the development of other drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This statement is contradicted by precedent. Prime example that a history of drug approvals for HIV AIDS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis, to name just a few. In neurology, the first medicine ever approved for MS was in 1993 when beta interferon received accelerated approval in the United States. Within the next several years, 2 two other types of beta interferon were approved after controlled clinical trials showed that they slowed the progression of disability. Today, there are more than 20 drugs approved for the treatment of MS. All of which reduce the risk of relapse or slow the progression of disability or both. All new molecular entities were approved based on randomized controlled clinical trials that continue to be conducted to this day, nearly 30 years after the accelerated approval of beta interferon. 
We believe a similar situation is just starting to unfold with Alzheimer's disease. Over the coming years, data will become available from Phase III trials of several second-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, which are capable of effectively removing amyloid plaque. And we also will have the results of the post-marketing trial of aducanumab. These data should address any residual uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of this class. 
In the meantime, the main serious risk associated with aducanumab is ARIA. Based on data from the Phase III trials, ARIA, which is an amyloid-related imaging abnormality, occurred in 41 of patients who -- percent of patients who took aducanumab 10 milligrams per kilogram and 10% of patients who took placebo. Of the patients taking aducanumab that experienced ARIA, 24% experienced clinical symptoms. In other words, about 10% of patients treated with the approved dose of aducanumab experienced symptomatic ARIA. Serious symptoms were reported in 0.3% of patients. 
Alzheimer's disease is 100% fatal. And before death, it robs people of themselves. Should these additional clinical studies confirm that this class of drugs is effective in slowing clinical decline, as Michel mentioned, patients who lack access to aducanumab may no longer be appropriate for treatment. 
We have been discussing the aducanumab data for many months now. Aducanumab was approved for use in the United States on June 7, and the data are summarized clearly in the label. Our hope is for doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of taking aducanumab with their patients and caregivers based on rational analysis and accurate information. 
We are doing what we can to provide that information to the prescribing community in a number of ways. 
First, we will continue to present at scientific forums and publish analyses from our Phase III trials of aducanumab, with a focus on publishing the primary manuscript and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA. This includes 4 presentations planned for the AAIC conference next week. 
Second, we are moving with a sense of urgency to finalize the design of the aducanumab post-marketing confirmatory Phase IV controlled study, intended to verify the clinical benefit of aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We are still working through the details and are actively engaged with regulators. Our goal is to execute the study as expeditiously as possible and well ahead of the post-marketing commitment of approximately 9 years. 
Third, we have a unique data generation opportunity with the EMBARK long-term extension study. Just this month, we enrolled our last patient in the trial, bringing the total enrollment in the study up to roughly 1,700 Alzheimer's disease patients. The 2-year EMBARK study will include patients previously treated with aducanumab for [ up to ] approximately 6.5 years, thereby generating important long-term safety and efficacy data for aducanumab. We plan to present the EMBARK baseline data at an upcoming medical meeting, which should yield important insights on the effects of treatment interruption, the longer-term impact of reducing amyloid plaques and the potential benefits of continued treatment. 
Lastly, we plan to initiate a real-world observational study in Alzheimer's disease called EyeCare AD U.S. in order to collect real-world long-term effectiveness and safety data on aducanumab. 
We are also evaluating additional formulations of aducanumab, with the goal of increasing patient confidence. Last month, we initiated a Phase I study to evaluate bioavailability of a subcutaneous formulation of aducanumab and continue to engage with regulators on the appropriate development strategy. 
Finally, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. This includes lucanumab, our other anti-amyloid antibody that we are collaborating on with Eisai. Lucanumab was recently awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA, and we are working with Eisai to engage with the FDA and pursue the optimum regulatory pathway. We also look forward to the readout of the CLARITY Phase III study of lucanumab expected next year. 
In addition to our anti-amyloid approaches, we are also targeting tau, the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Although we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, we do not believe these results diminish the relevance of tau as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Whereas we have discontinued the BIIB092 program, we are continuing the development of BIIB080, our antisense oligonucleotide, which aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intra and extracellular. Results of the Phase I trial will be presented at AAIC next week. 
In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this quarter, we continued to progress a broad neuroscience pipeline with positive data readouts in depression and stroke, both areas in need of innovation. 
First, in neuropsychiatry. In collaboration with Sage, we were excited to learn that the Phase III waterfall study evaluating a 50-milligram dose of zuranolone in major disorder achieved its primary endpoint. Despite the pronounced placebo effect observed in the waterfall study, 2 weeks of zuranolone treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 15, as measured by the HAM-D17 scale versus placebo. Zuranolone treatment also resulted in a rapid onset of action, showing treatment effects at day 3, 8 and 12. The safety profile was similar to that seen previously, in that most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and we observed no signal of increased suicidalization or behavior or withdrawal symptoms. We continue to believe that zuranolone, with its rapid treatment response, durable treatment effects after a 2-week dosing period and differentiated tolerability, has the potential to transform treatment for people suffering from depression. We are now working with Sage to determine the optimum filing path. The waterfall study is also -- is part of the robust development program for zuranolone, which also includes the ongoing SHORELINE oral and SKYLARK studies. We expect to report top line data from Coral and Shoreline in 2021. We are working with Sage to evaluate enrollment rates for the SKYLARK study, and we'll provide updates when that work is completed. 
We also obtained positive data from the Phase IIa study of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Current standard of care in the treatment of ischemic stroke calls for the use of thrombolytic agents within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The approved agents also carry the risk of intracranial hemorrhage or ICH, which increases with time. 
During the Phase IIa study of TMS-007, now referred to as BIIB131, the patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, with an average of 9.5 hours. There was no symptomatic ICH in the BIIB131 group. When compared to placebo, BIIB 131 increased the rate of recanalization of occluded intracranial arteries, as visualized by MRN geography in patients with large vessel strokes. Moreover, more patients regained the ability to function independently, as measured by the modified rank in scale at day 90 compared to placebo. We are encouraged by the results of this study and are hopeful that BIIB131 could have the potential to be a next-generation thrombolytic drug to safely extend the treatment window after stroke onset. We plan to advance BIIB131 into the late stages of development as soon as possible. 
We also bolstered our MS pipeline through a proposed license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for a Phase II oral small molecule BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of MS. Orilibrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and demonstrated CNS penetrants, is currently being studied in a global placebo-controlled Phase II study in relapsing remitting MS. The ability of orilibrutinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, combined with its high kinase selectivity, differentiates it from other BTK inhibitors currently in development for MS. 
Looking towards the remainder of the year, we also have 2 pivotal readouts remaining in ALS and depression. Earlier this month, we completed the 1-year placebo-controlled treatment period of the Phase III study of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, and we expect the readout by this fall. We also recently enrolled the first participant in ATLAS, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating people earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease. 
In summary, this quarter, our R&D organization made significant progress advancing our pipeline. In addition to the accelerated approval of aducanumab, we completed 5 mid- to late-stage readouts in several key therapeutic areas characterized by high unmet need, including depression and stroke. 
The field of neuroscience is rapidly advancing. And with the investments we have made in prioritizing genetically validated targets, deploying biomarkers in early-stage clinical programs, and building our human and technological capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by this exciting area of science for the benefit of patients. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."
29726,1673352174,2349243,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However,",1494,"Thank you, Al. 
As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However, as we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business as well as the launch of adu helm in the United States. 
Total revenue for the second quarter of $2.8 billion declined 25% versus the prior year at actual currency and 26% at constant currency. This decline reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics, in addition to approximately $330 million in revenue that was recorded in Q2 2020 related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property. We were however encouraged to see total revenue increased by 3% versus Q1 of 2021, primarily driven by the MS franchise and OCREVUS royalties. 
Total Aduhelm revenue for the second quarter was $2 million. I would refer you to our slides and commentary that we gave on our June 8 call for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune. 
Total MS revenue for the second quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties. 
Looking now at some of the individual products within MS. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the second quarter was $488 million. In the U.S., second quarter revenue of $178 million increased versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and shipping dynamics. And we expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to continue to decline throughout the year. Outside of the U.S., second quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $309 million increased 15% versus the prior year, with 6% underlying patient growth. 
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $74 million in the first quarter to $91 million in the second quarter. And as Michel mentioned, we believe that VUMERITY can become a $1 billion annual revenue product over time. 
TYSABRI's second quarter global revenue of $524 million increased 21% versus the prior year, benefiting from shipping dynamics in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS. 
Moving now to SMA. 
Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $500 million increased 1% versus the prior year at actual currency and decreased 3% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $149 million decreased by 29% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 23% versus the prior year, although some of this growth was attributable to accelerated shipments. 
Moving now to our biosimilars business. 
Second quarter revenue of $202 million increased 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. This growth occurred despite our biosimilars business continuing to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we are now the leading anti-TNF provider in Europe. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the second quarter of $440 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 32% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties. 
Second quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue, up slightly from 82% in the prior quarter and down from 89% and in Q2 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. In addition, Q2 2020 includes approximately $330 million in revenue related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. 
Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet. 
Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $585 million, which included approximately $50 million of upfront payments related to 3 business development deals: one with Biothera for biosimilars; a second with capsogen in gene therapy; and a third with Ginkgo to develop a novel gene therapy manufacturing platform. 
Second quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $115 million related to Agile Home. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A cost is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. 
Second quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expenses by $15 million, which includes a reimbursement of $85 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of adu helm in the U.S. 
In the second quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 19% in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter non-GAAP income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $84 million includes a milestone payment of $100 million to Neurimmune, related to the launch of adu helm in the U.S. Note that Eisai's 45% share of this milestone payment was recognized in the collaboration profit sharing line. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $450 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $3.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 150 million shares for the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter was $5.68, which increased from $5.34 in Q1 of 2021. 
In the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $72 million and free cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as a result, $3.3 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter. 
Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position, with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term. 
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. 
We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion to a new range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion, primarily as a result of stronger performance in our MS franchise and higher OVRVUS royalties. We are maintaining our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $17.50 to $19, notwithstanding the inclusion of the $125 million upfront payment related to our recently announced collaboration with InnoCare, which we expect to incur in Q3. This payment was not included in our previous guidance. Our CapEx guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million. Our guidance continues to assume modest Aduhelm revenue in 2021 due to dosing titration the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients and the time that it will take to secure payer coverage. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond. 
We expect continued erosion of both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S. And that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 83% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic. 
Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This updated R&D guidance range includes the expected $125 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2021, which, as I mentioned, was not included in our prior guidance. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to include an approximate $600 million Aduhelm investment. Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai, and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. Of course, as the launch progresses, we will actively manage the pace of the spend. This guidance continues to reflect our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations, such as InnoCare, program readouts and investments in Aduhelm. 
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $3.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities. 
We assume that foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions other than InnoCare in our guidance. 
So in closing, we were very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position, with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

So again, it's -- and you're absolutely right in your question and your description of what we are exposed to. But we are not the one suffering the most. It's still the early day in the launch. It's still the beginning. And whatever the motives of the controversy are, the one who are potentially misled, confused, denied help are the patients. 
If we look at the past experience, progress has to be made with the first step. And we can look at HIV, oncology or MS, as Al said. And let me bring you back to early 1990s and HIV. The FDA approved a first product based on CD4 counts. And there were tremendous controversy. Then they will progress on load, and then survival. And then 29 products or so were approved until today. And today, it's managed HIV as a chronic disease. This came with tremendous investment in the field. And the importance of the biomarker is that it's often present prior to the clinical symptoms. And this situation, this scenario could very well be the same for AD. Where are those today who were fighting at that time the biomarker-based approval for HIV therapies a few years back? The same applies to oncology.

And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving.",956,"Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you, Michael, for the question. 
And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving. I do have quite a bit to share however so I would ask that you please bear with me as I think I need to make it through some of these key topics that I believe you'll be very interested in. 
So let me first start with the patients. Physicians have definitely shared that since launch, there has been a significant amount of patient interest across the entire country, not only from their existing diagnosed patients that they are aware of, but also from new patient referrals from primary care physicians, which is also excellent. 
On the last call that we held, I did share that the primary focus of our team is to provide access to patients by supporting sites as they build the capability and infrastructure to treat patients. So sites are just now taking that first step in their internal process, which is to complete their P&T committee reviews. The majority of the Alzheimer's specialists that we have been talking to have been really extremely highly engaged with both our commercial and our medical teams as they operationalize their sites. We have seen several sites move faster than anticipated, which is also very good news for us. And as Michel mentioned in his opening, we estimate that 35% of the ready sites have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or they've indicated that they're not requiring the step. 
As I'm sure you've also seen, a few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to Aduhelm for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at the centers who had actually planned to treat their patients with Aduhelm. So our teams are making every attempt to get in front of the decision-makers in order to help them better understand the science and data. 
The AD specialists and the champions of these sites are also urging their sites to reconsider these decisions. Now remember though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they have asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients. We've also experienced during this time that patients and their families are not giving up, and they will seek new sites if necessary, and we are also seeing that in the field. Our field teams share the sense of urgency, of course. And as we've also said in a public statement, if any patient has denied access to care, we encourage them to contact our Biogen support services for help, and we will support them. 
Now for the sites that have completed a positive P&T committee review or don't require one, there are still several steps to operationalize the complex patient journey. You might have seen recently published several AD specialists recently said, building this infrastructure for the appropriate use of Aduhelm will require time, resources and some creative planning. In fact, I recently just visited several sites. And what I saw is consistent with what we're seeing across the entire country. 
Sites are currently right now developing their protocols. They are reengaging with their patients. They are considering or scheduling amyloid beta confirmation. They also are ordering baseline MRIs. Then they are discussing these results of the tests and making the treatment decision with their patients. This is clearly taking quite a bit of time. 
On our last call with you, we shared a program that we created with LabCorp and Mayo Clinical Labs to help physicians and patients access CSF diagnostic laboratory testing. We are also seeing a very strong interest in this program. In fact, we have already seen the first orders come in for both of our lab partners. 
Sites are also trying to gain clarity, as you said, on the reimbursement pathway. The decision by CMS to open an NCD analysis will help provide additional clarity to sites and health care providers. Now while this analysis is underway, coverage decisions will be made by regional Medicare administrative contractors, as you know as the MAX, and the Medicare Advantage plans. Based on precedent, we expect the MAX and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage for Aduhelm. Now while NCD for drugs are rare, and the only recent example of a drug NCD analysis, which was CAR-T, both MAX and Medicare Advantage plans continued to cover this product during the NCA process. 
We can also confirm that some Medicare Advantage plans have already approved prior authorizations for Aduhelm. For the MAX, due to the miscellaneous coding, it does take them a little bit of time to process the claims, but we are also aware that MAX have received claims already. So during the NCD analysis, we're actively working with sites to support patient access and reimbursement. 
Keep in mind, and as I witnessed across the various sites that I visited, each site will operationalize at different rates, which is why patient infusions will build gradually over the year, as we've referenced. Though this process will take time, it was absolutely humbling to see how much effort and passion these physicians are putting into building the infrastructure to treat their patients. And I am really proud of how hard our teams are working to support these sites as they break new ground. Our teams are staying focused though, Michael. We have a job to do on behalf of the AD community, and we will not be distracted from that mission no matter what we see. Thank you."

I'll go ahead and answer that. 
So while it's too early in the process to speculate the outcome of this NCD analysis, I will provide some inputs so people can understand that there are 5 potential scenarios at [indiscernible]. 
So first, there is a no-coverage decision. While this is theoretically an outcome, in the last 15 years, there are no examples of FDA-approved drugs not being covered. So I think that that's important to know. Second, there is coverage to indication or basically label. And third, you can have coverage with restrictions, so they can maybe give you instruction around specific population of patients, or they can limit prescribing potentially the specialists and then they'll define who those specialists are. Fourth, you can have coverage with evidence development. And lastly, it can be left to the MAX discretion. 
So importantly, once a national coverage decision is made, all of the MAX and the Med Advantage plans must abide by the NCD. Meaning the NCD will overrule any local or Medicare Advantage plan that is in place. That's why we believe NCD will drive some consistency of access and clear reimbursement expectations, which is actually very good for everyone since you know one of the questions that people have are, is this going to be reimbursed? So with that being said, if there were to be a negative outcome, though we can't speculate on it, of course, in Biogen's true form, we would want to obviously have a conversation on that and see what other outcome potentially could happen depending on additional data they might need."

And since PDUFA, we have continued to hear a high level of interest in our ABC program, which I talked about prior, which is the CSF testing, which you heard me talked about in my first answer. 
Now the reason why there is a high interest is primarily due to 3 reasons. First, we're hearing a consistent message from the AD experts and the clinicians that they will align their patient selection to the patient population studied in our clinical trials. So 100% of patients in our clinical development program were confirmed for amyloid plaques. However, just you so also know, no one's really come out with a policy yet. So I can't actually tell you that there's been a mandate on amyloid beta confirmation, but we would expect that potentially those will be in the policies. 
Second, there is currently no reimbursed test to confirm the presence of amyloid and this program that we offer as a solution to provide access to patients who would otherwise lack the ability to pay for this lab test, let alone the cost of a PET scan. 
And as you know, for PET scanning, third, there are still several areas of the country, in particular, the Mountain West, Hawaii and Alaska, where access to amyloid pet is not available due to the distribution of radiopharmacies and the limited half-life of the radio ligand. But I also said on a prior call that we do need both PET and CSF. And we have seen these orders come in for both of our lab partners.

I think when it comes to the P&T committee, the staff that we gave you, the 35%, is actually the only stat that I can provide at this point in time. And this number changes on a daily basis, right? So P&T committee reviews are happening across the country. We obviously are aware of the really big ones that become public. But some of the smaller ones that are in our targeted sites coming on a daily basis, so I can't actually provide that accurate number. 
However, for the second part of your question, I can't comment on the decision-making process at the specific sites. However, I will say that we are disappointed that sites that have specialized in Alzheimer's disease have indicated they will not provide access to Aduhelm for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the 80 specialists at the sites, of course. 
Each site will have their own specific process and decision makers, so there's not really a single reason. And even the reasons that you might see publicly are slightly different from what we actually hear directly, which, again, causes even more confusion in the marketplace. And just so you know, we're making every attempt to get in front of these decision makers to help them better understand the science and data. And also, there have been specialists and champions at these sites to see if they can reconsider their current policy. 
But do remember that many of the physicians can still prescribe the product and have asked for support to find alternative sites so they can infuse their patients. With that being said, there are going to be other sites that look to these accounts to see what kind of policies and procedures that they do put in place depending on their decision-making. However, at the end of the day, these accounts have also said it is just for now. And there may be a potential opportunity to have them reconsider that in the very near future."

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio.

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surrounding the recent approval of ADUHELM.
We are cognizant of the key issues raised by the community and are working to provide additional clarity through the following goals: Exploring all options to maximize patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity; educating on the updated label language, which I will discuss; publishing our Phase III results in a peer reviewed journal and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA; expediting the execution of the Phase IV confirmatory study; and leveraging the unique data generation opportunity we have with EMBARK, the longest and most comprehensive longitudinal study for an Alzheimer's disease therapy.
Biogen stands behind our clinical data from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients that supported accelerated approval. As the FDA's current chief stated publicly earlier this month, ADUHELM was approved appropriately on very solid grounds and represented the right thing to do for the patients.
I want to be clear that Biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process. Respectful dialogue between the industry and regulators is standard and essential to advance the understanding of the therapeutic data driving innovation, as demonstrated more recently by the COVID-19 vaccines development programs of last year.
We believe the accelerated approval pathway has transformed the treatment of oncology, and now has the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the concerns about the price, and are committed to ensure sustainability of the system and maximizing access for patients.
Without access, every day that passes, we estimate that approximately 1,000 Americans move from the early stage of Alzheimer's to moderate or severe dementia, and therefore, may no longer be appropriate for an any session of treatment with ADUHELM. This is why we are working with a sense of urgency to engage with the community, with payers, with CMS and with policymakers to discuss potential innovative approaches, with the goal of ensuring the price does not represent access issues for patients.
With that said, I would like to focus on the fundamentals. Another quarter with solid underlying financial performance that exceeded our expectation, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and key readouts across our diversified portfolio.
First, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM represents the first new therapy for Alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years. Biogen has a deep history of building new markets and delivering innovative and impactful therapies to patients in need. We pioneered it and currently maintain the market-leading portfolio of therapies for MS. We delivered the first approved and market-leading therapy for SMA.
Now with ADUHELM, we have the first approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which we believe represents a significant value creation opportunity for years to come.
To lead us in successfully executing on our long-term leadership strategy, I am pleased to announce that Rachid Izzar will be head of our newly created Alzheimer's disease and dementia business unit and will join the Executive Committee of Biogen. Rachid is currently in charge of Biogen's intercontinental region and our biosimilars business unit. His experience across multiple geographies and global position will serve us well as he works to maximize our potential impact on the lives of people living with this devastating disease.
We have seen strong indications of very high initial patient interest in ADUHELM as well as increased referrals from PCPs to specialists. However, it will take some time for sites to get up and running. While some large centers have said they will refrain for now for administering adherent to patients, many other sites are moving forward with internal processes, such as pharmacy and therapeutics or P&T committee review, with some accelerating faster than we had originally planned.
Of the 900 sites approximately, which we expected to be ready shortly after approval, we estimate that approximately 325 or 35% have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated that they won't require a P&T review. We have also seen some sites leverage external infusion centers if they face internal resistance or awaiting clarity on their facilities internal process. We continue to believe that, consistent with our clinical trials, most specialists will require confirmation of amyloid beta pathology, either via PET or CSF, which is also taking time to schedule and coordinate.
In terms of reimbursement, it is still the early days, and I'm pleased to say that we have seen the first examples of Medicare Advantage plans approving pre-authorization. We welcome the recent opening of a national coverage determination analysis by CMS for monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid beta, including ADUHELM. We believe this process will provide additional clarity on coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and drive consistency of access across the country. We expect that regional Medicare administrative contractors and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage of our ADUHELM while the NCD analysis is underway. We believe that CMS's swift decision to initiate the NCD analysis is a testament to the large unmet need in Alzheimer's disease and the urgency to clarify access for patients.
We obtained new label language for ADUHELM in July to clarify that treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's dementia. This is the population studied in our clinical trials and where we generated clinical evidence, as stated in Section 14 of the ADUHELM label. This updated language aligns with our consistent expectation that ADUHELM will be prescribed mainly by specialists for patients in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. And this update has been well received by the community, including prescribers, payers and policymakers.
Outside the U.S., we continued to engage with regulators regarding the ongoing review in Europe, Japan and other markets, while also continuing to submit new regulatory filing around the world. In addition, we are pursuing early access mechanisms wherever possible, including an early access program and a charge managed access program.
We recognize that building a new market for Alzheimer's disease is an unprecedented undertaking. And that this is just the beginning of our journey, as we aim to make ADUHELM and potentially lecanemab accessible to patients around the world. We believe our teams are well equipped to successfully execute on a well-defined strategy aimed at long-term leadership for Biogen in Alzheimer's disease.
Second, this quarter, our pipeline delivered meaningful mid- to late-stage results in key areas, including depression, stroke and biosimilars. The positive waterfall Phase III trial of zuranolone in major depressive disorder is a significant milestone towards bringing a differentiated potential treatment option to the 17 million patients suffering from depression in the U.S. alone.
The observed rapid onset of benefit in as soon as 3 days, in addition to a differentiated tolerability profile and 2-week dosing regimen, underscore our belief that if approved, zuranolone would be a multibillion-dollar product.
We were also excited to see positive data from the Phase IIa trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a second leading cause of death worldwide, and those who survive may suffer irreversible damage of the brain. We are highly encouraged by the results of the trial, and we immediately moved forward with executing the option to acquire TMS-007.
Should both zuranolone and TMS-007 be approved, Biogen will be in a leadership position in offering novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, the #1 neurodegenerative disease depression, one of the most common mental health disorder, and stroke, a leading cause of neurologic disability.
In addition to these results, we had a positive Phase III readout for our biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. With these positive results in hand, we begin to prepare for a regulatory filing.
As with any company engaging in breakthrough science, we also had setbacks in some programs, including our anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and our gene therapy programs in ophthalmology.
Third, we reported a solid quarter as we continued to execute well across our core business of MS, SMA and biosimilars. And we are pleased to be raising our revenue guidance for the year, which Mike will discuss.
Q2 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.8 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience, with a 5% increase in patients worldwide. This performance underscore our ability to execute well.
We were very pleased to see continued revenue growth for VUMERITY, which remains the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to VUMERITY's strong product profile. Given the progress of the VUMERITY launch to date, in addition to planned ex U.S. launches, we believe VUMERITY can reach over $1 billion in annual sales over time.
We also continued to invest in new potential treatment to address the remaining unmet medical needs in -- for MS patients. Last week, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for orelabrutinib, an innovative CNS penetrant Phase II BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of all forms of MS. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
Next, SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $500 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation continued to decrease versus Q1 of this year. Total revenue in the U.S. was flat versus the prior quarter. And SPINRAZA continued to perform very well outside the U.S., with 23% revenue growth versus Q2 of last year.
SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA. And we stand behind SPINRAZA's proven efficacy and well-established safety profile across all types of that SPINRAZA-perceived efficacy among adult has improved over the past year and exceeds the efficacy perception for therapeutic alternatives, including Risdiplam.
Although we face near-term competitive pressure in SMA, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow over the medium to long term, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by overall market growth, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, continued data generation, particularly in older patients, and further geographic expansion.
Our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $202 million this quarter. While we remain focused on executing against our currently marketed therapies, we also look to expand our portfolio, including our recent collaboration with Bio-Thera and a positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar referencing Lucentis.
Fourth, we still have 2 key Phase III readouts anticipated in the remainder of 2021. This includes the Phase III study for tofersen, potentially the first genetically targeted therapy for ALS, as well as an additional Phase III for zuranolone in major depressive disorder.
Given the incredible unmet medical need in ALS and encouraging results from the prior tofersen trial, we recently initiated an individual compassionate use program to provide tofersen to the most rapidly progressing patients suffering from SOD1 ALS.
Taken together, these developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multifranchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas.
I would like now to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D."

I'd like to start by saying a few words about aducanumab.
The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path and the regulatory process in general.
Since June 7, the FDA has made several clarifying statements on these topics. As always, we defer to the FDA as the lead voice on such matters. They are the independent regulatory body charged with weighing the data expertly and dispassionately in order to make critical decisions that have the potential to impact millions of people.
But I thought it would be helpful to add our perspective about several of these topics, including our interactions with the agency.
We are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aducanumab and the hope it brings to patients with Alzheimer's disease. We are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the FDA demonstrated during a very lengthy process. We, therefore, welcome a formal review into the interactions between FDA and Biogen on the path to the approval of aducanumab.
A better understanding of the facts is good for everyone involved to assure confidence in both the therapy and the process by which it was approved. We will cooperate fully with the review even as we prioritize the issues that affect patients.
I want to underscore that it is normal and appropriate for scientists and clinicians to discuss the data from experiments and clinical trials to debate and to disagree on the interpretation of the data. That is how science advances, and we welcome these discussions. However, I would like to correct some of the misinformation we have seen recently.
First, several people have stated that all anti-amyloid antibodies clear amyloid from the brain. This is factually incorrect. First-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, such as bapineuzumab and solanezumab, are not specific for aggregated forms of Abeta or target soluble monomeric Abeta, and crenezumab, being an IgG4, is deficient in effector function. As a result, these antibodies do not clear amyloid from the brain.
This slide shows the amyloid PET imaging results from the peer-reviewed literature of these first-generation antibodies.
Crenezumab and solanezumab had no significant difference from placebo on amyloid plaque burden. Bapineuzumab did show a significant difference from placebo in the Phase III trials, but this was largely driven by an unexplained increase in amyloid plaque burden in these placebo-treated patients in the mild to moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease.
We believe this increase in amyloid plaque in placebo patients must have been a spurious result as we now know that plaque buildup reaches a maximum by the time the patients have mild cognitive impairment.
In short, there is no evidence that the first-generation antibodies against Abeta actually removed amyloid plaque. There is no basis for using the failure of these antibodies as a reason not to approve aducanumab.
We have also seen statements that all of aducanumab results are post hoc. That is also factually incorrect. The primary and secondary endpoints had been prespecified in the Phase III trial protocols and statistical analysis plans before the first patient was enrolled into the trials. The aducanumab label shows the results on these prespecified endpoints based on data that had already been collected at the sites by the time the trials were prematurely terminated on March 21, 2019.
Separately, some have contended that ARIA led to unblinding. We took great care to ensure that the neurologists who assess the clinical outcome measures did not know about the occurrence of ARIA. One way in which we assured ourselves that unblinded -- unblinding did not affect the results was to examine the clinical outcomes after ARIA was seen. If ARIA had affected blinding, the results after ARIA might be expected to change.
This slide shows that the results excluding data that have been obtained after ARIA events were the same as the overall results. Thus, we are confident that unblinding due to ARIA did not affect the results of the Phase III trials of aducanumab.
And finally, some people have opined that the approval of aducanumab would inhibit the development of other drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This statement is contradicted by precedent. Prime example that a history of drug approvals for HIV AIDS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis, to name just a few.
In neurology, the first medicine ever approved for MS was in 1993 when beta interferon received accelerated approval in the United States. Within the next several years, 2 two other types of beta interferon were approved after controlled clinical trials showed that they slowed the progression of disability.
Today, there are more than 20 drugs approved for the treatment of MS. All of which reduce the risk of relapse or slow the progression of disability or both. All new molecular entities were approved based on randomized controlled clinical trials that continue to be conducted to this day, nearly 30 years after the accelerated approval of beta interferon.
We believe a similar situation is just starting to unfold with Alzheimer's disease. Over the coming years, data will become available from Phase III trials of several second-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, which are capable of effectively removing amyloid plaque. And we also will have the results of the post-marketing trial of aducanumab. These data should address any residual uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of this class.
In the meantime, the main serious risk associated with aducanumab is ARIA. Based on data from the Phase III trials, ARIA, which is an amyloid-related imaging abnormality, occurred in 41 of patients who -- percent of patients who took aducanumab 10 milligrams per kilogram and 10% of patients who took placebo. Of the patients taking aducanumab that experienced ARIA, 24% experienced clinical symptoms. In other words, about 10% of patients treated with the approved dose of aducanumab experienced symptomatic ARIA. Serious symptoms were reported in 0.3% of patients.
Alzheimer's disease is 100% fatal. And before death, it robs people of themselves. Should these additional clinical studies confirm that this class of drugs is effective in slowing clinical decline, as Michel mentioned, patients who lack access to aducanumab may no longer be appropriate for treatment.
We have been discussing the aducanumab data for many months now. Aducanumab was approved for use in the United States on June 7, and the data are summarized clearly in the label. Our hope is for doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of taking aducanumab with their patients and caregivers based on rational analysis and accurate information.
We are doing what we can to provide that information to the prescribing community in a number of ways.
First, we will continue to present at scientific forums and publish analyses from our Phase III trials of aducanumab, with a focus on publishing the primary manuscript and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA. This includes 4 presentations planned for the AAIC conference next week.
Second, we are moving with a sense of urgency to finalize the design of the aducanumab post-marketing confirmatory Phase IV controlled study, intended to verify the clinical benefit of aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We are still working through the details and are actively engaged with regulators. Our goal is to execute the study as expeditiously as possible and well ahead of the post-marketing commitment of approximately 9 years.
Third, we have a unique data generation opportunity with the EMBARK long-term extension study. Just this month, we enrolled our last patient in the trial, bringing the total enrollment in the study up to roughly 1,700 Alzheimer's disease patients. The 2-year EMBARK study will include patients previously treated with aducanumab for up to approximately 6.5 years, thereby generating important long-term safety and efficacy data for aducanumab.
We plan to present the EMBARK baseline data at an upcoming medical meeting, which should yield important insights on the effects of treatment interruption, the longer-term impact of reducing amyloid plaques and the potential benefits of continued treatment.
Lastly, we plan to initiate a real-world observational study in Alzheimer's disease called [ EyeCare AD U.S. ] in order to collect real-world long-term effectiveness and safety data on aducanumab.
We are also evaluating additional formulations of aducanumab with the goal of increasing patient confidence. Last month, we initiated a Phase I study to evaluate bioavailability of a subcutaneous formulation of aducanumab and continued to engage with regulators on the appropriate development strategy.
Finally, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. This includes lecanemab, our other anti-amyloid antibody that we are collaborating on with Eisai. Lecanemab was recently awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA, and we are working with Eisai to engage with the FDA and pursue the optimum regulatory pathway. We also look forward to the readout of the CLARITY Phase III study of lecanemab expected next year.
In addition to our anti-amyloid approaches, we are also targeting tau, the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Although we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, we do not believe these results diminish the relevance of tau as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
Whereas we have discontinued the BIIB092 program, we are continuing the development of BIIB080, our antisense oligonucleotide, which aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intra and extracellular. Results of the Phase I trial will be presented at AAIC next week.
In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this quarter, we continued to progress a broad neuroscience pipeline with positive data readouts in depression and stroke, both areas in need of innovation.
First, in neuropsychiatry. In collaboration with Sage, we were excited to learn that the Phase III waterfall study evaluating a 50-milligram dose of zuranolone in major depressive disorder achieved its primary endpoint. Despite the pronounced placebo effect observed in the waterfall study, 2 weeks of zuranolone treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 15, as measured by the HAM-D17 scale versus placebo.
Zuranolone treatment also resulted in a rapid onset of action, showing treatment effects at day 3, 8 and 12. The safety profile was similar to that seen previously, in that most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and we observed no signal of increased suicidalization or behavior or withdrawal symptoms.
We continue to believe that zuranolone, with its rapid treatment response, durable treatment effects after a 2-week dosing period and differentiated tolerability, has the potential to transform treatment for people suffering from depression. We are now working with Sage to determine the optimum filing path. The waterfall study is also -- is part of the robust development program for zuranolone, which also includes the ongoing SHORELINE oral and SKYLARK studies.
We expect to report top line data from Coral and Shoreline in 2021. We are working with Sage to evaluate enrollment rates for the SKYLARK study, and we'll provide updates when that work is completed.
We also obtained positive data from the Phase IIa study of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Current standard of care in the treatment of ischemic stroke calls for the use of thrombolytic agents within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The approved agents also carry the risk of intracranial hemorrhage or ICH, which increases with time.
During the Phase IIa study of TMS-007, now referred to as BIIB131, the patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, with an average of 9.5 hours. There was no symptomatic ICH in the BIIB131 group. When compared to placebo, BIIB 131 increased the rate of recanalization of occluded intracranial arteries, as visualized by MRN geography in patients with large vessel strokes.
Moreover, more patients regained the ability to function independently, as measured by the modified rank in scale at day 90 compared to placebo. We are encouraged by the results of this study and are hopeful that BIIB131 could have the potential to be a next-generation thrombolytic drug to safely extend the treatment window after stroke onset. We plan to advance BIIB131 into the late stages of development as soon as possible.
We also bolstered our MS pipeline through a proposed license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for a Phase II oral small molecule BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of MS. Orelabrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and demonstrated CNS penetrants, is currently being studied in a global placebo-controlled Phase II study in relapsing remitting MS. The ability of orilibrutinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, combined with its high kinase selectivity, differentiates it from other BTK inhibitors currently in development for MS.
Looking towards the remainder of the year, we also have 2 pivotal readouts remaining in ALS and depression. Earlier this month, we completed the 1-year placebo-controlled treatment period of the Phase III study of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, and we expect the readout by this fall.
We also recently enrolled the first participant in ATLAS, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating people earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease.
In summary, this quarter, our R&D organization made significant progress advancing our pipeline. In addition to the accelerated approval of aducanumab, we completed 5 mid- to late-stage readouts in several key therapeutic areas characterized by high unmet need, including depression and stroke.
The field of neuroscience is rapidly advancing. And with the investments we have made in prioritizing genetically validated targets, deploying biomarkers in early-stage clinical programs, and building our human and technological capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by this exciting area of science for the benefit of patients. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."

As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However, as we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business as well as the launch of ADUHELM in the United States.
Total revenue for the second quarter of $2.8 billion declined 25% versus the prior year at actual currency and 26% at constant currency. This decline reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics, in addition to approximately $330 million in revenue that was recorded in Q2 2020 related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property. We were however encouraged to see total revenue increased by 3% versus Q1 of 2021, primarily driven by the MS franchise and OCREVUS royalties.
Total ADUHELM revenue for the second quarter was $2 million. I would refer you to our slides and commentary that we gave on our June 8 call for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune.
Total MS revenue for the second quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties.
Looking now at some of the individual products within MS.
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the second quarter was $488 million. In the U.S., second quarter revenue of $178 million increased versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and shipping dynamics. And we expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to continue to decline throughout the year. Outside of the U.S., second quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $309 million increased 15% versus the prior year, with 6% underlying patient growth.
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $74 million in the first quarter to $91 million in the second quarter. And as Michel mentioned, we believe that VUMERITY can become a $1 billion annual revenue product over time.
TYSABRI's second quarter global revenue of $524 million increased 21% versus the prior year, benefiting from shipping dynamics in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS.
Moving now to SMA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $500 million increased 1% versus the prior year at actual currency and decreased 3% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $149 million decreased by 29% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition.
Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 23% versus the prior year, although some of this growth was attributable to accelerated shipments.
Moving now to our biosimilars business. Second quarter revenue of $202 million increased 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. This growth occurred despite our biosimilars business continuing to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we are now the leading anti-TNF provider in Europe. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the second quarter of $440 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 32% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties.
Second quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue, up slightly from 82% in the prior quarter and down from 89% and in Q2 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. In addition, Q2 2020 includes approximately $330 million in revenue related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. 
Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $585 million, which included approximately $50 million of upfront payments related to 3 business development deals: One with Bio-Thera for biosimilars; a second with Capsigen in gene therapy; and a third with Ginkgo to develop a novel gene therapy manufacturing platform.
Second quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $115 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A cost is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.
Second quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expenses by $15 million, which includes a reimbursement of $85 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S.
In the second quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 19% in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter non-GAAP income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $84 million includes a milestone payment of $100 million to Neurimmune, related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. Note that Eisai's 45% share of this milestone payment was recognized in the collaboration profit sharing line.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $450 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $3.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 150 million shares for the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter was $5.68, which increased from $5.34 in Q1 of 2021.
In the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $72 million and free cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as a result, $3.3 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.
Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position, with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term.
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion to a new range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion, primarily as a result of stronger performance in our MS franchise and higher OCREVUS royalties.
We are maintaining our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $17.50 to $19, notwithstanding the inclusion of the $125 million upfront payment related to our recently announced collaboration with InnoCare, which we expect to incur in Q3. This payment was not included in our previous guidance. Our CapEx guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million.
Our guidance continues to assume modest ADUHELM revenue in 2021 due to dosing titration the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients and the time that it will take to secure payer coverage. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond.
We expect continued erosion of both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S. And that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 83% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic.
Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This updated R&D guidance range includes the expected $125 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2021, which, as I mentioned, was not included in our prior guidance. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to include an approximate $600 million ADUHELM investment.
Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai, and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. Of course, as the launch progresses, we will actively manage the pace of the spend. This guidance continues to reflect our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations, such as InnoCare, program readouts and investments in ADUHELM.
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $3.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities.
We assume that foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions other than InnoCare in our guidance.
So in closing, we were very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position, with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

It is an exciting time at Biogen. And it is all about execution for the coming period. Our base MS, SMA, biosimilars business is performing well, demonstrating resilience despite competition. We have an incredible opportunity together with Eisai. And we are completely focused on operational execution for the global launch of ADUHELM, and hopefully soon, lecanemab.
We have positive Phase III data for depression. And we are anxiously awaiting data for tofersen in SOD1-ALS. We believe we have a significant value creation opportunity ahead of us. We stand behind the clinical data for ADUHELM, including the integrity of the approval process. Again, today, our top priority is patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity. And we are open to innovative approaches to ensure budget sustainability.
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs.

So again, it's -- and you're absolutely right in your question and your description of what we are exposed to. But we are not the one suffering the most. It's still the early day in the launch. It's still the beginning. And whatever the motives of the controversy are, the one who are potentially misled, confused, denied help are the patients. 
If we look at the past experience, progress has to be made with the first step. And we can look at HIV, oncology or MS, as AL said. And let me bring you back to early 1990s and HIV. The FDA approved a first product based on CD4 counts. And there were tremendous controversy. Then they will progress on [indiscernible], and then survival. And then 29 products or so were approved until today. And today, it's managed HIV as a chronic disease. This came with tremendous investment in the field. And the importance of the biomarker is that it's often present prior to the clinical symptoms. And this situation, this scenario could very well be the same for AD. Where are those today who were fighting at that time the biomarker-based approval for HIV therapies a few years back? The same applies to oncology.

And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving.",958,"Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you, Michael, for the question. 
And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving. I do have quite a bit to share however so I would ask that you please bear with me as I think I need to make it through some of these key topics that I believe you'll be very interested in. 
So let me first start with the patients. Physicians have definitely shared that since launch, there has been a significant amount of patient interest across the entire country, not only from their existing diagnosed patients that they are aware of, but also from new patient referrals from primary care physicians, which is also excellent. 
On the last call that we held, I did share that the primary focus of our team is to provide access to patients by supporting sites as they build the capability and infrastructure to treat patients. So sites are just now taking that first step in their internal process, which is to complete their P&T committee reviews. The majority of the Alzheimer's specialists that we have been talking to have been really extremely highly engaged with both our commercial and our medical teams as they operationalize their sites. We have seen several sites move faster than anticipated, which is also very good news for us. And as Michel mentioned in his opening, we estimate that 35% of the ready sites have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or they've indicated that they're not requiring the step. 
As I'm sure you've also seen, a few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at these centers who had actually planned to treat their patients with ADUHELM. So our teams are making every attempt to get in front of the decision-makers in order to help them better understand the science and data. 
The AD specialists and the champions of these sites are also urging their sites to reconsider these decisions. Now remember though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they had asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients. We've also experienced during this time that patients and their families are not giving up, and they will seek new sites if necessary, and we are also seeing that in the field. Our field teams share the sense of urgency, of course. And as we've also said in a public statement, if any patient has denied access to care, we encourage them to contact our Biogen support services for help, and we will support them. 
Now for the sites that have completed a positive P&T committee review or don't require one, there are still several steps to operationalize the complex patient journey. You might have seen recently published several AD specialists recently said, building this infrastructure for the appropriate use of ADUHELM will require time, resources and some creative planning. In fact, I recently just visited several sites. And what I saw is consistent with what we're seeing across the entire country. 
Sites are currently right now developing their protocols. They are reengaging with their patients. They are considering or scheduling amyloid beta confirmation. They also are ordering baseline MRIs. Then they are discussing these results of the tests and making the treatment decision with their patients. This is clearly taking quite a bit of time. 
On our last call with you, we shared a program that we created with LabCorp and Mayo Clinical Labs to help physicians and patients access CSF diagnostic laboratory testing. We are also seeing a very strong interest in this program. In fact, we have already seen the first orders come in for both of our lab partners. 
Sites are also trying to gain clarity, as you said, on the reimbursement pathway. The decision by CMS to open an NCD analysis will help provide additional clarity to sites and health care providers. Now while this analysis is underway, coverage decisions will be made by regional Medicare administrative contractors, as you know as the MAX, and the Medicare Advantage Plans. Based on precedent, we expect the MAX and Medicare Advantage Plans will provide coverage for ADUHELM. Now while NCD for drugs are rare, and the only recent example of a drug NCD analysis, which was CAR-T, both MAX and Medicare Advantage Plans continued to cover these -- this product during the NCA process. 
We can also confirm that some Medicare Advantage Plans have already approved prior authorizations for ADUHELM. For the MAX, due to the miscellaneous coding, it does take them a little bit of time to process the claims, but we are also aware that MAX have received claims already. So during the NCD analysis, we're actively working with sites to support patient access and reimbursement. 
Keep in mind, and as I witnessed across the various sites that I visited, each site will operationalize at different rates, which is why patient infusions will build gradually over the year, as we've referenced. Though this process will take time, it was absolutely humbling to see how much effort and passion these physicians are putting into building the infrastructure to treat their patients. And I am really proud of how hard our teams are working to support these sites as they break new ground. Our teams are staying focused though, Michael. We have a job to do on behalf of the AD community, and we will not be distracted from that mission no matter what we see. Thank you."

I'll go ahead and answer that. 
So while it's too early in the process to speculate the outcome of this NCD analysis, I will provide some inputs so people can understand that there are 5 potential scenarios at [indiscernible]. 
So first, there is a no-coverage decision. While this is theoretically an outcome, in the last 15 years, there are no examples of FDA-approved drugs not being covered. So I think that that's important to know. Second, there is coverage to indication or basically label. And third, you can have coverage with restrictions, so they can maybe give you restriction around specific population of patients, or they can limit prescribing potentially the specialists and they'll define who those specialists are. Fourth, you can have coverage with evidence development. And lastly, it can be left to the MAX discretion. 
So importantly, once a national coverage decision is made, all of the MAX and the Med Advantage Plans must abide by the NCD. Meaning the NCD will overrule any local or Medicare Advantage plan that is in place. That's why we believe NCD will drive some consistency of access and clear reimbursement expectations, which is actually very good for everyone since you know one of the questions that people had -- have are, is this going to be reimbursed? So with that being said, if there were to be a negative outcome, though we can't speculate on it, of course, in Biogen's true form, we would want to obviously have a conversation on that and see what other outcome potentially could happen depending on additional data they might need."

And since PDUFA, we have continued to hear a high level of interest in our ABC program, which I talked about prior, which is the CSF testing, which you heard me talked about in my first answer. 
Now the reason why there is a high interest is primarily due to 3 reasons. First, we're hearing a consistent message from the AD experts and the clinicians that they will align their patient selection to the patient population studied in our clinical trials. So 100% of patients in our clinical development program were confirmed for amyloid plaques. However, just you so also know, no one's really come out with a policy yet. So I can't actually tell you that there's been a mandate on amyloid beta confirmation, but we would expect that potentially those will be in the policies. 
Second, there is currently no reimbursed test to confirm the presence of amyloid and this program that we offer as a solution to provide access to patients who would otherwise lack the ability to pay for this lab test, let alone the cost of a PET scan. 
And as you know, for PET scanning, third, there are still several areas of the country, in particular, the Mountain West, Hawaii and Alaska, where access to amyloid PET is not available due to the distribution of radiopharmacies and the limited half-life of the radio ligand. But I also said on a prior call that we do need both PET and CSF. And we have seen these orders come in for both of our lab partners. And we are still working diligently with a coalition to see if we can get pet reimbursement through CMS."

But some of the smaller ones that are in our targeted sites coming on a daily basis, so I can't actually provide that accurate number. 
However, for the second part of your question, I can't comment on the decision-making process at the specific sites. However, I will say that we are disappointed that sites that have specialized in Alzheimer's disease have indicated they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the 80 specialists at the sites, of course. 
Each site will have their own specific process and decision makers, so there's not really a single reason. And even the reasons that you might see publicly are slightly different from what we actually hear directly, which, again, causes even more confusion in the marketplace. And just so you know, we're making every attempt to get in front of these decision makers to help them better understand the science and data. And also, there have been specialists and champions at these sites to see if they can reconsider their current policy. 
But do remember that many of the physicians can still prescribe the product and have asked for support to find alternative sites so they can infuse their patients. With that being said, there are going to be other sites that look to these accounts to see what kind of policies and procedures that they do put in place depending on their decision-making. However, at the end of the day, these accounts have also said it is just for now. And there may be a potential opportunity to have them reconsider that in the very near future."

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio.

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surrounding the recent approval of ADUHELM.
We are cognizant of the key issues raised by the community and are working to provide additional clarity through the following goals: Exploring all options to maximize patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity; educating on the updated label language, which I will discuss; publishing our Phase III results in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA; expediting the execution of the Phase IV confirmatory study; and leveraging the unique data generation opportunity we have with EMBARK, the longest and most comprehensive longitudinal study for an Alzheimer's disease therapy.
Biogen stands behind our clinical data from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients that supported accelerated approval. As the FDA's current chief stated publicly earlier this month, ADUHELM was approved appropriately on very solid grounds and represented the right thing to do for the patients.
I want to be clear that Biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process. Respectful dialogue between the industry and regulators is standard and essential to advance the understanding of the therapeutic data driving innovation, as demonstrated more recently by the COVID-19 vaccines development programs of last year.
We believe the accelerated approval pathway has transformed the treatment of oncology, and now has the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the concerns about the price, and are committed to ensure sustainability of the system and maximizing access for patients.
Without access, every day that passes, we estimate that approximately 1,000 Americans move from the early stage of Alzheimer's to moderate or severe dementia, and therefore, may no longer be appropriate for an any session of treatment with ADUHELM. This is why we are working with a sense of urgency to engage with the community, with payers, with CMS and with policymakers to discuss potential innovative approaches, with the goal of ensuring the price does not represent access issues for patients.
With that said, I would like to focus on the fundamentals. Another quarter with solid underlying financial performance that exceeded our expectation, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and key readouts across our diversified portfolio.
First, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM represents the first new therapy for Alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years. Biogen has a deep history of building new markets and delivering innovative and impactful therapies to patients in need. We pioneered and currently maintain the market-leading portfolio of therapies for MS. We delivered the first approved and market-leading therapy for SMA.
Now with ADUHELM, we have the first approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which we believe represents a significant value creation opportunity for years to come.
To lead us in successfully executing on our long-term leadership strategy, I am pleased to announce that Rachid Izzar will be head of our newly created Alzheimer's disease and dementia business unit and will join the Executive Committee of Biogen. Rachid is currently in charge of Biogen's intercontinental region and our biosimilars business unit. His experience across multiple geographies and global position will serve us well as he works to maximize our potential impact on the lives of people living with this devastating disease.
We have seen strong indications of very high initial patient interest in ADUHELM as well as increased referrals from PCPs to specialists. However, it will take some time for sites to get up and running. While some large centers have said they will refrain for now for administering ADUHELM to patients, many other sites are moving forward with internal processes, such as pharmacy and therapeutics or P&T committee review, with some accelerating faster than we had originally planned.
Of the 900 sites approximately, which we expected to be ready shortly after approval, we estimate that approximately 325 or 35% have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated that they won't require a P&T review. We have also seen some sites leverage external infusion centers if they face internal resistance or awaiting clarity on their facilities internal process. We continue to believe that, consistent with our clinical trials, most specialists will require confirmation of amyloid beta pathology, either via PET or CSF, which is also taking time to schedule and coordinate.
In terms of reimbursement, it is still the early days, and I'm pleased to say that we have seen the first examples of Medicare Advantage plans approving pre-authorization. We welcome the recent opening of a national coverage determination analysis by CMS for monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid beta, including ADUHELM. We believe this process will provide additional clarity on coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and drive consistency of access across the country. 
We expect that regional Medicare administrative contractors and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage of our ADUHELM while the NCD analysis is underway. We believe that CMS's swift decision to initiate the NCD analysis is a testament to the large unmet need in Alzheimer's disease and the urgency to clarify access for patients.
We obtained new label language for ADUHELM in July to clarify that treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's dementia. This is the population studied in our clinical trials and where we generated clinical evidence, as stated in Section 14 of the ADUHELM label. This updated language aligns with our consistent expectation that ADUHELM will be prescribed mainly by specialists for patients in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. And this update has been well received by the community, including prescribers, payers and policymakers.
Outside the U.S., we continue to engage with regulators regarding the ongoing review in Europe, Japan and other markets, while also continuing to submit new regulatory filing around the world. In addition, we are pursuing early access mechanisms wherever possible, including an early access program and a charge managed access program.
We recognize that building a new market for Alzheimer's disease is an unprecedented undertaking. And that this is just the beginning of our journey, as we aim to make ADUHELM and potentially lecanemab accessible to patients around the world. We believe our teams are well equipped to successfully execute on a well-defined strategy aimed at long-term leadership for Biogen in Alzheimer's disease.
Second, this quarter, our pipeline delivered meaningful mid- to late-stage results in key areas, including depression, stroke and biosimilars. The positive WATERFALL Phase III trial of zuranolone in major depressive disorder is a significant milestone towards bringing a differentiated potential treatment option to the 17 million patients suffering from depression in the U.S. alone.
The observed rapid onset of benefit in as soon as 3 days, in addition to a differentiated tolerability profile and 2-week dosing regimen, underscore our belief that if approved, zuranolone would be a multibillion-dollar product.
We were also excited to see positive data from the Phase IIa trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a second leading cause of death worldwide, and those who survive may suffer irreversible damage of the brain. We are highly encouraged by the results of the trial, and we immediately moved forward with executing the option to acquire TMS-007.
Should both zuranolone and TMS-007 be approved, Biogen will be in a leadership position in offering novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, the #1 neurodegenerative disease, depression, one of the most common mental health disorder, and stroke, a leading cause of neurologic disability.
In addition to these results, we had a positive Phase III readout for our biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. With these positive results in hand, we begin to prepare for a regulatory filing.
As with any company engaging in breakthrough science, we also had setbacks in some programs, including our anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and our gene therapy programs in ophthalmology.
Third, we reported a solid quarter as we continued to execute well across our core business of MS, SMA and biosimilars. And we are pleased to be raising our revenue guidance for the year, which Mike will discuss.
Q2 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.8 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience, with a 5% increase in patients worldwide. This performance underscore our ability to execute well.
We were very pleased to see continued revenue growth for VUMERITY, which remains the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to VUMERITY's strong product profile. Given the progress of the VUMERITY launch to date, in addition to planned ex U.S. launches, we believe VUMERITY can reach over $1 billion in annual sales over time.
We also continued to invest in new potential treatment to address the remaining unmet medical needs in -- for MS patients. Last week, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for orelabrutinib, an innovative CNS penetrant Phase II BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of all forms of MS. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
Next, SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $500 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation continued to decrease versus Q1 of this year. Total revenue in the U.S. was flat versus the prior quarter. And SPINRAZA continued to perform very well outside the U.S. with 23% revenue growth versus Q2 of last year.
SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA. And we stand behind SPINRAZA's proven efficacy and well-established safety profile across all types of SMA. In fact, our market research indicates that SPINRAZA's perceived efficacy among adults has improved over the past year and exceeds the efficacy perception for therapeutic alternatives, including Risdiplam.
Although we face near-term competitive pressure in SMA, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow over the medium to long term, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by overall market growth, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, continued data generation, particularly in older patients, and further geographic expansion.
Our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $202 million this quarter. While we remain focused on executing against our currently marketed therapies, we also look to expand our portfolio, including our recent collaboration with Bio-Thera and a positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar referencing Lucentis.
Fourth, we still have 2 key Phase III readouts anticipated in the remainder of 2021. This includes the Phase III study for tofersen, potentially the first genetically targeted therapy for ALS, as well as an additional Phase III for zuranolone in major depressive disorder.
Given the incredible unmet medical need in ALS and encouraging results from the prior tofersen trial, we recently initiated an individual compassionate use program to provide tofersen to the most rapidly progressing patients suffering from SOD1-ALS.
Taken together, these developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multifranchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas.
I would like now to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D."

The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approva",2308,"Thank you, Michel.
I'd like to start by saying a few words about aducanumab. The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path and the regulatory process in general.
Since June 7, the FDA has made several clarifying statements on these topics. As always, we defer to the FDA as the lead voice on such matters. They are the independent regulatory body charged with weighing the data expertly and dispassionately in order to make critical decisions that have the potential to impact millions of people.
But I thought it would be helpful to add our perspective about several of these topics, including our interactions with the agency.
We are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aducanumab and the hope it brings to patients with Alzheimer's disease. We are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the FDA demonstrated during a very lengthy process. We, therefore, welcome a formal review into the interactions between FDA and Biogen on the path to the approval of aducanumab.
A better understanding of the facts is good for everyone involved to assure confidence in both the therapy and the process by which it was approved. We will cooperate fully with the review even as we prioritize the issues that affect patients.
I want to underscore that it is normal and appropriate for scientists and clinicians to discuss the data from experiments and clinical trials to debate and to disagree on the interpretation of the data. That is how science advances, and we welcome these discussions. However, I would like to correct some of the misinformation we have seen recently.
First, several people have stated that all anti-amyloid antibodies clear amyloid from the brain. This is factually incorrect. First-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, such as bapineuzumab and solanezumab, are not specific for aggregated forms of Abeta or target soluble monomeric Abeta, and crenezumab, being an IgG4, is deficient in effector function. As a result, these antibodies do not clear amyloid from the brain.
This slide shows the amyloid PET imaging results from the peer-reviewed literature of these first-generation antibodies. Crenezumab and solanezumab had no significant difference from placebo on amyloid plaque burden. Bapineuzumab did show a significant difference from placebo in the Phase III trials, but this was largely driven by an unexplained increase in amyloid plaque burden in these placebo-treated patients in the mild-to-moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease.
We believe this increase in amyloid plaque in placebo patients must have been a spurious result as we now know that plaque buildup reaches a maximum by the time the patients have mild cognitive impairment.
In short, there is no evidence that the first-generation antibodies against Abeta actually removed amyloid plaque. There is no basis for using the failure of these antibodies as a reason not to approve aducanumab.
We have also seen statements that all of aducanumab results are post hoc. That is also factually incorrect. The primary and secondary endpoints had been prespecified in the Phase III trial protocols and statistical analysis plans before the first patient was enrolled into the trial. The aducanumab label shows the results on these prespecified endpoints based on data that had already been collected at the sites by the time the trials were prematurely terminated on March 21, 2019.
Separately, some have contended that ARIA led to unblinding. We took great care to ensure that the neurologists who assessed the clinical outcome measures did not know about the occurrence of ARIA. One way in which we assured ourselves that unblinded -- unblinding did not affect the results was to examine the clinical outcomes after ARIA was seen. If ARIA had affected blinding, the results after ARIA might be expected to change.
This slide shows that the results excluding data that have been obtained after ARIA events were the same as the overall results. Thus, we are confident that unblinding due to ARIA did not affect the results of the Phase III trials of aducanumab.
And finally, some people have opined that the approval of aducanumab would inhibit the development of other drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This statement is contradicted by precedent. Prime example that a history of drug approvals for HIV/AIDS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis, to name just a few.
In neurology, the first medicine ever approved for MS was in 1993 when beta interferon received accelerated approval in the United States. Within the next several years, 2 other types of beta interferon were approved after controlled clinical trials showed that they slowed the progression of disability.
Today, there are more than 20 drugs approved for the treatment of MS. All of which reduce the risk of relapse or slow the progression of disability or both. All new molecular entities were approved based on randomized controlled clinical trials that continue to be conducted to this day, nearly 30 years after the accelerated approval of beta interferon.
We believe a similar situation is just starting to unfold with Alzheimer's disease. Over the coming years, data will become available from Phase III trials of several second-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, which are capable of effectively removing amyloid plaque. And we also will have the results of the post-marketing trial of aducanumab. These data should address any residual uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of this class.
In the meantime, the main serious risk associated with aducanumab is ARIA. Based on data from the Phase III trials, ARIA, which is an amyloid-related imaging abnormality, occurred in 41% of patients who took aducanumab 10 milligrams per kilogram and 10% of patients who took placebo. Of the patients taking aducanumab that experienced ARIA, 24% experienced clinical symptoms. In other words, about 10% of patients treated with the approved dose of aducanumab experienced symptomatic ARIA. Serious symptoms were reported in 0.3% of patients.
Alzheimer's disease is 100% fatal. And before death, it robs people of themselves. Should these additional clinical studies confirm that this class of drugs is effective in slowing clinical decline, as Michel mentioned, patients who lack access to aducanumab may no longer be appropriate for treatment.
We have been discussing the aducanumab data for many months now. Aducanumab was approved for use in the United States on June 7, and the data are summarized clearly in the label. Our hope is for doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of taking aducanumab with their patients and caregivers based on rational analysis and accurate information.
We are doing what we can to provide that information to the prescribing community in a number of ways.
First, we will continue to present at scientific forums and publish analyses from our Phase III trials of aducanumab, with a focus on publishing the primary manuscript and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA. This includes 4 presentations planned for the AAIC conference next week.
Second, we are moving with a sense of urgency to finalize the design of the aducanumab post-marketing confirmatory Phase IV controlled study, intended to verify the clinical benefit of aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We are still working through the details and are actively engaged with regulators. Our goal is to execute the study as expeditiously as possible and well ahead of the post-marketing commitment of approximately 9 years.
Third, we have a unique data generation opportunity with the EMBARK long-term extension study. Just this month, we enrolled our last patient in the trial, bringing the total enrollment in the study up to roughly 1,700 Alzheimer's disease patients. The 2-year EMBARK study will include patients previously treated with aducanumab for up to approximately 6.5 years, thereby generating important long-term safety and efficacy data for aducanumab.
We plan to present the EMBARK baseline data at an upcoming medical meeting, which should yield important insights on the effects of treatment interruption, the longer-term impact of reducing amyloid plaques and the potential benefits of continued treatment.
Lastly, we plan to initiate a real-world observational study in Alzheimer's disease called ICARE AD-US in order to collect real-world long-term effectiveness and safety data on aducanumab.
We are also evaluating additional formulations of aducanumab with the goal of increasing patient confidence. Last month, we initiated a Phase I study to evaluate bioavailability of a subcutaneous formulation of aducanumab and continued to engage with regulators on the appropriate development strategy.
Finally, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. This includes lecanemab, our other anti-amyloid antibody that we are collaborating on with Eisai. Lecanemab was recently awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA, and we are working with Eisai to engage with the FDA and pursue the optimum regulatory pathway. We also look forward to the readout of the CLARITY Phase III study of lecanemab expected next year.
In addition to our anti-amyloid approaches, we are also targeting tau, the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Although we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, we do not believe these results diminish the relevance of tau as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
Whereas we have discontinued the BIIB092 program, we are continuing the development of BIIB080, our antisense oligonucleotide, which aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intra and extracellular. Results of the Phase I trial will be presented at AAIC next week.
In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this quarter, we continued to progress a broad neuroscience pipeline with positive data readouts in depression and stroke, both areas in need of innovation.
First, in neuropsychiatry. In collaboration with Sage, we were excited to learn that the Phase III WATERFALL study evaluating a 50-milligram dose of zuranolone in major depressive disorder achieved its primary endpoint. Despite the pronounced placebo effect observed in the WATERFALL study, 2 weeks of zuranolone treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 15, as measured by the HAM-D-17 scale versus placebo.
Zuranolone treatment also resulted in a rapid onset of action, showing treatment effects at day 3, 8 and 12. The safety profile was similar to that seen previously, in that most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and we observed no signal of increased suicidal ideation or behavior or withdrawal symptoms.
We continue to believe that zuranolone, with its rapid treatment response, durable treatment effects after a 2-week dosing period and differentiated tolerability, has the potential to transform treatment for people suffering from depression. We are now working with Sage to determine the optimum filing path. The WATERFALL study is also -- is part of the robust development program for zuranolone, which also includes the ongoing SHORELINE, CORAL and SKYLARK studies.
We expect to report top line data from CORAL and SHORELINE in 2021. We are working with Sage to evaluate enrollment rates for the SKYLARK study, and we'll provide updates when that work is completed.
We also obtained positive data from the Phase IIa study of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Current standard of care in the treatment of ischemic stroke calls for the use of thrombolytic agents within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The approved agents also carry the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, or ICH, which increases with time.
During the Phase IIa study of TMS-007, now referred to as BIIB131, the patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, with an average of 9.5 hours. There was no symptomatic ICH in the BIIB131 group. When compared to placebo, BIIB131 increased the rate of recanalization of occluded intracranial arteries, as visualized by MR angiography in patients with large vessel strokes.
Moreover, more patients regained the ability to function independently, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale at day 90 compared to placebo. We are encouraged by the results of this study and are hopeful that BIIB131 could have the potential to be a next-generation thrombolytic drug to safely extend the treatment window after stroke onset. We plan to advance BIIB131 into the late stages of development as soon as possible.
We also bolstered our MS pipeline through a proposed license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for a Phase II oral small molecule BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of MS. Orelabrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and demonstrated CNS penetrants, is currently being studied in a global placebo-controlled Phase II study in relapsing-remitting MS. The ability of orelabrutinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, combined with its high kinase selectivity, differentiates it from other BTK inhibitors currently in development for MS.
Looking towards the remainder of the year, we also have 2 pivotal readouts remaining in ALS and depression. Earlier this month, we completed the 1-year placebo-controlled treatment period of the Phase III study of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, and we expect the readout by this fall.
We also recently enrolled the first participant in ATLAS, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating people earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease.
In summary, this quarter, our R&D organization made significant progress advancing our pipeline. In addition to the accelerated approval of aducanumab, we completed 5 mid- to late-stage readouts in several key therapeutic areas characterized by high unmet need, including depression and stroke.
The field of neuroscience is rapidly advancing. And with the investments we have made in prioritizing genetically validated targets, deploying biomarkers in early-stage clinical programs, and building our human and technological capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by this exciting area of science for the benefit of patients. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."
29726,1673352174,2384573,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well.

As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However, as we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business as well as the launch of ADUHELM in the United States.
Total revenue for the second quarter of $2.8 billion declined 25% versus the prior year at actual currency and 26% at constant currency. This decline reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics, in addition to approximately $330 million in revenue that was recorded in Q2 2020 related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property. We were however encouraged to see total revenue increase by 3% versus Q1 of 2021, primarily driven by the MS franchise and OCREVUS royalties.
Total ADUHELM revenue for the second quarter was $2 million. I would refer you to our slides and commentary that we gave on our June 8 call for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune.
Total MS revenue for the second quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties.
Looking now at some of the individual products within MS.
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the second quarter was $488 million. In the U.S., second quarter revenue of $178 million increased versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and shipping dynamics. And we expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to continue to decline throughout the year. Outside of the U.S., second quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $309 million increased 15% versus the prior year, with 6% underlying patient growth.
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $74 million in the first quarter to $91 million in the second quarter. And as Michel mentioned, we believe that VUMERITY can become a $1 billion annual revenue product over time.
TYSABRI's second quarter global revenue of $524 million increased 21% versus the prior year, benefiting from shipping dynamics in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS.
Moving now to SMA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $500 million increased 1% versus the prior year at actual currency and decreased 3% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $149 million decreased by 29% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 23% versus the prior year, although some of this growth was attributable to accelerated shipments.
Moving now to our biosimilars business. Second quarter revenue of $202 million increased 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. This growth occurred despite our biosimilars business continuing to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we are now the leading anti-TNF provider in Europe. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the second quarter of $440 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 32% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties.
Second quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue, up slightly from 82% in the prior quarter and down from 89% in Q2 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. In addition, Q2 2020 includes approximately $330 million in revenue related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. 
Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $585 million, which included approximately $50 million of upfront payments related to 3 business development deals: One with Bio-Thera for biosimilars; a second with Capsigen in gene therapy; and a third with Ginkgo to develop a novel gene therapy manufacturing platform.
Second quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $115 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A cost is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.
Second quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expenses by $15 million, which includes a reimbursement of $85 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S.
In the second quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 19% in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter non-GAAP income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $84 million includes a milestone payment of $100 million to Neurimmune, related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. Note that Eisai's 45% share of this milestone payment was recognized in the collaboration profit sharing line.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $450 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $3.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 150 million shares for the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter was $5.68, which increased from $5.34 in Q1 of 2021.
In the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $72 million and free cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as a result, $3.3 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.
Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term.
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion to a new range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion, primarily as a result of stronger performance in our MS franchise and higher OCREVUS royalties.
We are maintaining our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $17.50 to $19, notwithstanding the inclusion of the $125 million upfront payment related to our recently announced collaboration with InnoCare, which we expect to incur in Q3. This payment was not included in our previous guidance. Our CapEx guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million.
Our guidance continues to assume modest ADUHELM revenue in 2021 due to dosing titration, the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients and the time that it will take to secure payer coverage. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond.
We expect continued erosion of both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S. and that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 83% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic.
Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This updated R&D guidance range includes the expected $125 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2021, which, as I mentioned, was not included in our prior guidance. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to include an approximate $600 million ADUHELM investment.
Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai, and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. Of course, as the launch progresses, we will actively manage the pace of the spend. This guidance continues to reflect our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations, such as InnoCare, program readouts and investments in ADUHELM.
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $3.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities.
We assume that foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions other than InnoCare in our guidance.
So in closing, we were very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

If we look at the past experience, progress has to be made with the first step. And we can look at HIV, oncology or MS, as Al said. And let me bring you back to early 1990s and HIV. The FDA approved a first product based on CD4 counts. And there were tremendous controversy. Then they were progressed on viral loads, and then survival. And then 29 products or so were approved until today. And today, it's managed HIV as a chronic disease. This came with tremendous investment in the field. And the importance of the biomarker is that it's often present prior to the clinical symptoms. And this situation, this scenario could very well be the same for AD. Where are those today who were fighting at that time the biomarker-based approval for HIV therapies a few years back? The same applies to oncology.

And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving.",956,"Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you, Michael, for the question. 
And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving. I do have quite a bit to share however so I would ask that you please bear with me as I think I need to make it through some of these key topics that I believe you'll be very interested in. 
So let me first start with the patients. Physicians have definitely shared that since launch, there has been a significant amount of patient interest across the entire country, not only from their existing diagnosed patients that they are aware of, but also from new patient referrals from primary care physicians, which is also excellent. 
On the last call that we held, I did share that the primary focus of our team is to provide access to patients by supporting sites as they build the capability and infrastructure to treat patients. So sites are just now taking that first step in their internal process, which is to complete their P&T committee reviews. The majority of the Alzheimer's specialists that we have been talking to have been really extremely highly engaged with both our commercial and our medical teams as they operationalize their sites. We have seen several sites move faster than anticipated, which is also very good news for us. And as Michel mentioned in his opening, we estimate that 35% of the ready sites have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or they've indicated that they're not requiring the step.  
As I'm sure you've also seen, a few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at these centers who had actually planned to treat their patients with ADUHELM. So our teams are making every attempt to get in front of the decision-makers in order to help them better understand the science and data. 
The AD specialists and the champions of these sites are also urging their sites to reconsider these decisions. Now remember though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they have asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients. We've also experienced during this time that patients and their families are not giving up, and they will seek new sites if necessary, and we are also seeing that in the field. Our field teams share the sense of urgency, of course. And as we've also said in a public statement, if any patient is denied access to care, we encourage them to contact our Biogen support services for help, and we will support them. 
Next, for the sites that have completed a positive P&T committee review or don't require one, there are still several steps to operationalize the complex patient journey. You might have seen recently published, several AD specialists recently said, building this infrastructure for the appropriate use of ADUHELM will require time, resources and some creative planning. In fact, I recently just visited several sites. And what I saw is consistent with what we're seeing across the entire country. 
Sites are currently right now developing their protocols. They are reengaging with their patients. They are considering or scheduling amyloid beta confirmation. They also are ordering baseline MRIs. Then they are discussing these results of the tests and making the treatment decision with their patients. This is clearly taking quite a bit of time. 
On our last call with you, we shared a program that we created with LabCorp and Mayo Clinical Labs to help physicians and patients access CSF diagnostic laboratory testing. We are also seeing a very strong interest in this program. In fact, we have already seen the first orders come in for both of our lab partners. 
Sites are also trying to gain clarity, as you said, on the reimbursement pathway. The decision by CMS to open an NCD analysis will help provide additional clarity to sites and health care providers. Now while this analysis is underway, coverage decisions will be made by regional Medicare administrative contractors, as you know as the MACs, and the Medicare Advantage Plans. Based on precedent, we expect the MACs and Medicare Advantage Plans will provide coverage for ADUHELM. Now while NCD for drugs are rare, and the only recent example of a drug NCD analysis, which was CAR-T, both MACs and Medicare Advantage Plans continued to cover these -- this product during the NCA process. 
We can also confirm that some Medicare Advantage Plans have already approved prior authorizations for ADUHELM. For the MACs, due to the miscellaneous coding, it does take them a little bit of time to process the claims, but we are also aware that MACs have received claims already. So during the NCD analysis, we're actively working with sites to support patient access and reimbursement. 
Keep in mind, and as I witnessed across the various sites that I visited, each site will operationalize at different rates, which is why patient infusions will build gradually over the year, as we've referenced. Though this process will take time, it was absolutely humbling to see how much effort and passion these physicians are putting into building the infrastructure to treat their patients. And I am really proud of how hard our teams are working to support these sites as they break new ground. Our teams are staying focused though, Michael. We have a job to do on behalf of the AD community, and we will not be distracted from that mission no matter what we see."

I'll go ahead and answer that. 
So while it's too early in the process to speculate the outcome of this NCD analysis, I will provide some inputs so people can understand that there are 5 potential scenarios at [indiscernible]. 
So first, there is a no-coverage decision. While this is theoretically an outcome, in the last 15 years, there are no examples of FDA-approved drugs not being covered. So I think that that's important to know. Second, there is coverage to indication or basically label. And third, you can have coverage with restrictions, so they can maybe give you restriction around specific population of patients, or they can limit prescribing potentially the specialists and they'll define who those specialists are. Fourth, you can have coverage with evidence development. And lastly, it can be left to the MAX discretion. 
So importantly, once a national coverage decision is made, all of the MAX and the Med Advantage Plans must abide by the NCD. Meaning the NCD will overrule any local or Medicare Advantage plan that is in place. That's why we believe NCD will drive some consistency of access and clear reimbursement expectations, which is actually very good for everyone since you know one of the questions that people had -- have are, is this going to be reimbursed? So with that being said, if there were to be a negative outcome, though we can't speculate on it, of course, in Biogen's true form, we would want to obviously have a conversation on that and see what other outcome potentially could happen depending on additional data they might need."

And since PDUFA, we have continued to hear a high level of interest in our ABC program, which I talked about prior, which is the CSF testing, which you heard me talked about in my first answer. 
Now the reason why there is a high interest is primarily due to 3 reasons. First, we're hearing a consistent message from the AD experts and the clinicians that they will align their patient selection to the patient population studied in our clinical trials. So 100% of patients in our clinical development program were confirmed for amyloid plaques. However, just you so also know, no one's really come out with a policy yet. So I can't actually tell you that there's been a mandate on amyloid beta confirmation, but we would expect that potentially those will be in the policies. 
Second, there is currently no reimbursed test to confirm the presence of amyloid and this program that we offer as a solution to provide access to patients who would otherwise lack the ability to pay for this lab test, let alone the cost of a PET scan. 
And as you know, for PET scanning, third, there are still several areas of the country, in particular, the Mountain West, Hawaii and Alaska, where access to amyloid PET is not available due to the distribution of radiopharmacies and the limited half-life of the radio ligand. But I also said on a prior call that we do need both PET and CSF. And we have seen these orders come in for both of our lab partners.

However, I will say that we are disappointed that sites that have specialized in Alzheimer's disease have indicated they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the 80 specialists at the sites, of course. 
Each site will have their own specific process and decision makers, so there's not really a single reason.

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio.

We have completed the first half of a transformative year for Biogen, with progress across our neuroscience portfolio. However, I would like to start by addressing the confusion and criticism surrounding the recent approval of ADUHELM.
We are cognizant of the key issues raised by the community and are working to provide additional clarity through the following goals: Exploring all options to maximize patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity; educating on the updated label language, which I will discuss; publishing our Phase III results in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA; expediting the execution of the Phase IV confirmatory study; and leveraging the unique data generation opportunity we have with EMBARK, the longest and most comprehensive longitudinal study for an Alzheimer's disease therapy.
Biogen stands behind our clinical data from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients that supported accelerated approval. As the FDA's current chief stated publicly earlier this month, ADUHELM was approved appropriately on very solid grounds and represented the right thing to do for the patients.
I want to be clear that Biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process. Respectful dialogue between the industry and regulators is standard and essential to advance the understanding of the therapeutic data driving innovation, as demonstrated more recently by the COVID-19 vaccines development programs of last year.
We believe the accelerated approval pathway has transformed the treatment of oncology, and now has the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the concerns about the price, and are committed to ensure sustainability of the system and maximizing access for patients.
Without access, every day that passes, we estimate that approximately 1,000 Americans move from the early stage of Alzheimer's to moderate or severe dementia, and therefore, may no longer be appropriate for an any session of treatment with ADUHELM. This is why we are working with a sense of urgency to engage with the community, with payers, with CMS and with policymakers to discuss potential innovative approaches, with the goal of ensuring the price does not represent access issues for patients.
With that said, I would like to focus on the fundamentals. Another quarter with solid underlying financial performance that exceeded our expectation, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and key readouts across our diversified portfolio.
First, the accelerated approval of ADUHELM represents the first new therapy for Alzheimer's disease in almost 20 years. Biogen has a deep history of building new markets and delivering innovative and impactful therapies to patients in need. We pioneered and currently maintain the market-leading portfolio of therapies for MS. We delivered the first approved and market-leading therapy for SMA.
Now with ADUHELM, we have the first approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which we believe represents a significant value creation opportunity for years to come.
To lead us in successfully executing on our long-term leadership strategy, I am pleased to announce that Rachid Izzar will be head of our newly created Alzheimer's disease and dementia business unit and will join the Executive Committee of Biogen. Rachid is currently in charge of Biogen's intercontinental region and our biosimilars business unit. His experience across multiple geographies and global position will serve us well as he works to maximize our potential impact on the lives of people living with this devastating disease.
We have seen strong indications of very high initial patient interest in ADUHELM as well as increased referrals from PCPs to specialists. However, it will take some time for sites to get up and running. While some large centers have said they will refrain for now for administering ADUHELM to patients, many other sites are moving forward with internal processes, such as pharmacy and therapeutics or P&T committee review, with some accelerating faster than we had originally planned.
Of the 900 sites approximately, which we expected to be ready shortly after approval, we estimate that approximately 325 or 35% have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or indicated that they won't require a P&T review. We have also seen some sites leverage external infusion centers if they face internal resistance or awaiting clarity on their facilities internal process. We continue to believe that, consistent with our clinical trials, most specialists will require confirmation of amyloid beta pathology, either via PET or CSF, which is also taking time to schedule and coordinate.
In terms of reimbursement, it is still the early days, and I'm pleased to say that we have seen the first examples of Medicare Advantage plans approving pre-authorization. We welcome the recent opening of a national coverage determination analysis by CMS for monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid beta, including ADUHELM. We believe this process will provide additional clarity on coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and drive consistency of access across the country. 
We expect that regional Medicare administrative contractors and Medicare Advantage plans will provide coverage of our ADUHELM while the NCD analysis is underway. We believe that CMS's swift decision to initiate the NCD analysis is a testament to the large unmet need in Alzheimer's disease and the urgency to clarify access for patients.
We obtained new label language for ADUHELM in July to clarify that treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's dementia. This is the population studied in our clinical trials and where we generated clinical evidence, as stated in Section 14 of the ADUHELM label. This updated language aligns with our consistent expectation that ADUHELM will be prescribed mainly by specialists for patients in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. And this update has been well received by the community, including prescribers, payers and policymakers.
Outside the U.S., we continue to engage with regulators regarding the ongoing review in Europe, Japan and other markets, while also continuing to submit new regulatory filing around the world. In addition, we are pursuing early access mechanisms wherever possible, including an early access program and a charge managed access program.
We recognize that building a new market for Alzheimer's disease is an unprecedented undertaking. And that this is just the beginning of our journey, as we aim to make ADUHELM and potentially lecanemab accessible to patients around the world. We believe our teams are well equipped to successfully execute on a well-defined strategy aimed at long-term leadership for Biogen in Alzheimer's disease.
Second, this quarter, our pipeline delivered meaningful mid- to late-stage results in key areas, including depression, stroke and biosimilars. The positive WATERFALL Phase III trial of zuranolone in major depressive disorder is a significant milestone towards bringing a differentiated potential treatment option to the 17 million patients suffering from depression in the U.S. alone.
The observed rapid onset of benefit in as soon as 3 days, in addition to a differentiated tolerability profile and 2-week dosing regimen, underscore our belief that if approved, zuranolone would be a multibillion-dollar product.
We were also excited to see positive data from the Phase IIa trial of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a second leading cause of death worldwide, and those who survive may suffer irreversible damage of the brain. We are highly encouraged by the results of the trial, and we immediately moved forward with executing the option to acquire TMS-007.
Should both zuranolone and TMS-007 be approved, Biogen will be in a leadership position in offering novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease, the #1 neurodegenerative disease, depression, one of the most common mental health disorder, and stroke, a leading cause of neurologic disability.
In addition to these results, we had a positive Phase III readout for our biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. With these positive results in hand, we begin to prepare for a regulatory filing.
As with any company engaging in breakthrough science, we also had setbacks in some programs, including our anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease and our gene therapy programs in ophthalmology.
Third, we reported a solid quarter as we continued to execute well across our core business of MS, SMA and biosimilars. And we are pleased to be raising our revenue guidance for the year, which Mike will discuss.
Q2 overall MS revenue, including OCREVUS royalties, was $1.8 billion. Putting aside the entry of TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., our broader MS business continued to demonstrate resilience, with a 5% increase in patients worldwide. This performance underscore our ability to execute well.
We were very pleased to see continued revenue growth for VUMERITY, which remains the #1 oral MS product in terms of new prescriptions in the U.S. We believe this performance is a testament to VUMERITY's strong product profile. Given the progress of the VUMERITY launch to date, in addition to planned ex U.S. launches, we believe VUMERITY can reach over $1 billion in annual sales over time.
We also continued to invest in new potential treatment to address the remaining unmet medical needs in -- for MS patients. Last week, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for orelabrutinib, an innovative CNS penetrant Phase II BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of all forms of MS. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
Next, SPINRAZA generated second quarter global revenues of $500 million. While SPINRAZA is facing competition in the U.S., which has been exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we were encouraged to see that SPINRAZA discontinuation continued to decrease versus Q1 of this year. Total revenue in the U.S. was flat versus the prior quarter. And SPINRAZA continued to perform very well outside the U.S. with 23% revenue growth versus Q2 of last year.
SPINRAZA remains the market-leading treatment for SMA. And we stand behind SPINRAZA's proven efficacy and well-established safety profile across all types of SMA. In fact, our market research indicates that SPINRAZA's perceived efficacy among adults has improved over the past year and exceeds the efficacy perception for therapeutic alternatives, including Risdiplam.
Although we face near-term competitive pressure in SMA, we believe SPINRAZA can continue to grow over the medium to long term, both in the U.S. and globally, driven by overall market growth, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups, continued data generation, particularly in older patients, and further geographic expansion.
Our biosimilars business delivered revenue of $202 million this quarter. While we remain focused on executing against our currently marketed therapies, we also look to expand our portfolio, including our recent collaboration with Bio-Thera and a positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar referencing Lucentis.
Fourth, we still have 2 key Phase III readouts anticipated in the remainder of 2021. This includes the Phase III study for tofersen, potentially the first genetically targeted therapy for ALS, as well as an additional Phase III for zuranolone in major depressive disorder.
Given the incredible unmet medical need in ALS and encouraging results from the prior tofersen trial, we recently initiated an individual compassionate use program to provide tofersen to the most rapidly progressing patients suffering from SOD1-ALS.
Taken together, these developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multifranchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas.
I would like now to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D."

I'd like to start by saying a few words about aducanumab. The accelerated approval of aducanumab has generated discussions reflecting a broad range of opinions, including about its efficacy, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path and the regulatory process in general.
Since June 7, the FDA has made several clarifying statements on these topics. As always, we defer to the FDA as the lead voice on such matters. They are the independent regulatory body charged with weighing the data expertly and dispassionately in order to make critical decisions that have the potential to impact millions of people.
But I thought it would be helpful to add our perspective about several of these topics, including our interactions with the agency.
We are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aducanumab and the hope it brings to patients with Alzheimer's disease. We are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the FDA demonstrated during a very lengthy process. We, therefore, welcome a formal review into the interactions between FDA and Biogen on the path to the approval of aducanumab.
A better understanding of the facts is good for everyone involved to assure confidence in both the therapy and the process by which it was approved. We will cooperate fully with the review even as we prioritize the issues that affect patients.
I want to underscore that it is normal and appropriate for scientists and clinicians to discuss the data from experiments and clinical trials to debate and to disagree on the interpretation of the data. That is how science advances, and we welcome these discussions. However, I would like to correct some of the misinformation we have seen recently.
First, several people have stated that all anti-amyloid antibodies clear amyloid from the brain. This is factually incorrect. First-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, such as bapineuzumab and solanezumab, are not specific for aggregated forms of Abeta or target soluble monomeric Abeta, and crenezumab, being an IgG4, is deficient in effector function. As a result, these antibodies do not clear amyloid from the brain.
This slide shows the amyloid PET imaging results from the peer-reviewed literature of these first-generation antibodies. Crenezumab and solanezumab had no significant difference from placebo on amyloid plaque burden. Bapineuzumab did show a significant difference from placebo in the Phase III trials, but this was largely driven by an unexplained increase in amyloid plaque burden in these placebo-treated patients in the mild-to-moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease.
We believe this increase in amyloid plaque in placebo patients must have been a spurious result as we now know that plaque buildup reaches a maximum by the time the patients have mild cognitive impairment.
In short, there is no evidence that the first-generation antibodies against Abeta actually removed amyloid plaque. There is no basis for using the failure of these antibodies as a reason not to approve aducanumab.
We have also seen statements that all of aducanumab results are post hoc. That is also factually incorrect. The primary and secondary endpoints had been prespecified in the Phase III trial protocols and statistical analysis plans before the first patient was enrolled into the trial. The aducanumab label shows the results on these prespecified endpoints based on data that had already been collected at the sites by the time the trials were prematurely terminated on March 21, 2019.
Separately, some have contended that ARIA led to unblinding. We took great care to ensure that the neurologists who assessed the clinical outcome measures did not know about the occurrence of ARIA. One way in which we assured ourselves that unblinded -- unblinding did not affect the results was to examine the clinical outcomes after ARIA was seen. If ARIA had affected blinding, the results after ARIA might be expected to change.
This slide shows that the results excluding data that have been obtained after ARIA events were the same as the overall results. Thus, we are confident that unblinding due to ARIA did not affect the results of the Phase III trials of aducanumab.
And finally, some people have opined that the approval of aducanumab would inhibit the development of other drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This statement is contradicted by precedent. Prime example that a history of drug approvals for HIV/AIDS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis, to name just a few.
In neurology, the first medicine ever approved for MS was in 1993 when beta interferon received accelerated approval in the United States. Within the next several years, 2 other types of beta interferon were approved after controlled clinical trials showed that they slowed the progression of disability.
Today, there are more than 20 drugs approved for the treatment of MS. All of which reduce the risk of relapse or slow the progression of disability or both. All new molecular entities were approved based on randomized controlled clinical trials that continue to be conducted to this day, nearly 30 years after the accelerated approval of beta interferon.
We believe a similar situation is just starting to unfold with Alzheimer's disease. Over the coming years, data will become available from Phase III trials of several second-generation anti-amyloid antibodies, which are capable of effectively removing amyloid plaque. And we also will have the results of the post-marketing trial of aducanumab. These data should address any residual uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of this class.
In the meantime, the main serious risk associated with aducanumab is ARIA. Based on data from the Phase III trials, ARIA, which is an amyloid-related imaging abnormality, occurred in 41% of patients who took aducanumab 10 milligrams per kilogram and 10% of patients who took placebo. Of the patients taking aducanumab that experienced ARIA, 24% experienced clinical symptoms. In other words, about 10% of patients treated with the approved dose of aducanumab experienced symptomatic ARIA. Serious symptoms were reported in 0.3% of patients.
Alzheimer's disease is 100% fatal. And before death, it robs people of themselves. Should these additional clinical studies confirm that this class of drugs is effective in slowing clinical decline, as Michel mentioned, patients who lack access to aducanumab may no longer be appropriate for treatment.
We have been discussing the aducanumab data for many months now. Aducanumab was approved for use in the United States on June 7, and the data are summarized clearly in the label. Our hope is for doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of taking aducanumab with their patients and caregivers based on rational analysis and accurate information.
We are doing what we can to provide that information to the prescribing community in a number of ways.
First, we will continue to present at scientific forums and publish analyses from our Phase III trials of aducanumab, with a focus on publishing the primary manuscript and disseminating additional data to inform clinical practice, including the management of ARIA. This includes 4 presentations planned for the AAIC conference next week.
Second, we are moving with a sense of urgency to finalize the design of the aducanumab post-marketing confirmatory Phase IV controlled study, intended to verify the clinical benefit of aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We are still working through the details and are actively engaged with regulators. Our goal is to execute the study as expeditiously as possible and well ahead of the post-marketing commitment of approximately 9 years.
Third, we have a unique data generation opportunity with the EMBARK long-term extension study. Just this month, we enrolled our last patient in the trial, bringing the total enrollment in the study up to roughly 1,700 Alzheimer's disease patients. The 2-year EMBARK study will include patients previously treated with aducanumab for up to approximately 6.5 years, thereby generating important long-term safety and efficacy data for aducanumab.
We plan to present the EMBARK baseline data at an upcoming medical meeting, which should yield important insights on the effects of treatment interruption, the longer-term impact of reducing amyloid plaques and the potential benefits of continued treatment.
Lastly, we plan to initiate a real-world observational study in Alzheimer's disease called ICARE AD-US in order to collect real-world long-term effectiveness and safety data on aducanumab.
We are also evaluating additional formulations of aducanumab with the goal of increasing patient confidence. Last month, we initiated a Phase I study to evaluate bioavailability of a subcutaneous formulation of aducanumab and continued to engage with regulators on the appropriate development strategy.
Finally, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline of potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. This includes lecanemab, our other anti-amyloid antibody that we are collaborating on with Eisai. Lecanemab was recently awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA, and we are working with Eisai to engage with the FDA and pursue the optimum regulatory pathway. We also look forward to the readout of the CLARITY Phase III study of lecanemab expected next year.
In addition to our anti-amyloid approaches, we are also targeting tau, the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Although we were disappointed to learn that the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, we do not believe these results diminish the relevance of tau as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
Whereas we have discontinued the BIIB092 program, we are continuing the development of BIIB080, our antisense oligonucleotide, which aims to reduce the production of all forms of tau, both intra and extracellular. Results of the Phase I trial will be presented at AAIC next week.
In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this quarter, we continued to progress a broad neuroscience pipeline with positive data readouts in depression and stroke, both areas in need of innovation.
First, in neuropsychiatry. In collaboration with Sage, we were excited to learn that the Phase III WATERFALL study evaluating a 50-milligram dose of zuranolone in major depressive disorder achieved its primary endpoint. Despite the pronounced placebo effect observed in the WATERFALL study, 2 weeks of zuranolone treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 15, as measured by the HAM-D-17 scale versus placebo.
Zuranolone treatment also resulted in a rapid onset of action, showing treatment effects at day 3, 8 and 12. The safety profile was similar to that seen previously, in that most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and we observed no signal of increased suicidal ideation or behavior or withdrawal symptoms.
We continue to believe that zuranolone, with its rapid treatment response, durable treatment effects after a 2-week dosing period and differentiated tolerability, has the potential to transform treatment for people suffering from depression. We are now working with Sage to determine the optimum filing path. The WATERFALL study is also -- is part of the robust development program for zuranolone, which also includes the ongoing SHORELINE, CORAL and SKYLARK studies.
We expect to report top line data from CORAL and SHORELINE in 2021. We are working with Sage to evaluate enrollment rates for the SKYLARK study, and we'll provide updates when that work is completed.
We also obtained positive data from the Phase IIa study of TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Current standard of care in the treatment of ischemic stroke calls for the use of thrombolytic agents within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The approved agents also carry the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, or ICH, which increases with time.
During the Phase IIa study of TMS-007, now referred to as BIIB131, the patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, with an average of 9.5 hours. There was no symptomatic ICH in the BIIB131 group. When compared to placebo, BIIB131 increased the rate of recanalization of occluded intracranial arteries, as visualized by MR angiography in patients with large vessel strokes.
Moreover, more patients regained the ability to function independently, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale at day 90 compared to placebo. We are encouraged by the results of this study and are hopeful that BIIB131 could have the potential to be a next-generation thrombolytic drug to safely extend the treatment window after stroke onset. We plan to advance BIIB131 into the late stages of development as soon as possible.
We also bolstered our MS pipeline through a proposed license and collaboration agreement with InnoCare for a Phase II oral small molecule BTK inhibitor for the potential treatment of MS. Orelabrutinib, a covalent BTK inhibitor with high selectivity and demonstrated CNS penetrants, is currently being studied in a global placebo-controlled Phase II study in relapsing-remitting MS. The ability of orelabrutinib to cross the blood-brain barrier, combined with its high kinase selectivity, differentiates it from other BTK inhibitors currently in development for MS.
Looking towards the remainder of the year, we also have 2 pivotal readouts remaining in ALS and depression. Earlier this month, we completed the 1-year placebo-controlled treatment period of the Phase III study of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, and we expect the readout by this fall.
We also recently enrolled the first participant in ATLAS, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating people earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease.
In summary, this quarter, our R&D organization made significant progress advancing our pipeline. In addition to the accelerated approval of aducanumab, we completed 5 mid- to late-stage readouts in several key therapeutic areas characterized by high unmet need, including depression and stroke.
The field of neuroscience is rapidly advancing. And with the investments we have made in prioritizing genetically validated targets, deploying biomarkers in early-stage clinical programs, and building our human and technological capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by this exciting area of science for the benefit of patients. 
I will now pass the call over to Mike."
29726,1673352174,2384576,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However,",1489,"Thank you, Al. 
As Michel noted, we were very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued to execute well. We continue to face competition from TECFIDERA generics in the U.S., which impacted our year-over-year financial performance. However, as we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business as well as the launch of ADUHELM in the United States.
Total revenue for the second quarter of $2.8 billion declined 25% versus the prior year at actual currency and 26% at constant currency. This decline reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics, in addition to approximately $330 million in revenue that was recorded in Q2 2020 related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property. We were however encouraged to see total revenue increase by 3% versus Q1 of 2021, primarily driven by the MS franchise and OCREVUS royalties.
Total ADUHELM revenue for the second quarter was $2 million. I would refer you to our slides and commentary that we gave on our June 8 call for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune.
Total MS revenue for the second quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties.
Looking now at some of the individual products within MS.
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the second quarter was $488 million. In the U.S., second quarter revenue of $178 million increased versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and shipping dynamics. And we expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to continue to decline throughout the year. Outside of the U.S., second quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $309 million increased 15% versus the prior year, with 6% underlying patient growth.
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $74 million in the first quarter to $91 million in the second quarter. And as Michel mentioned, we believe that VUMERITY can become a $1 billion annual revenue product over time.
TYSABRI's second quarter global revenue of $524 million increased 21% versus the prior year, benefiting from shipping dynamics in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS.
Moving now to SMA. Global second quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $500 million increased 1% versus the prior year at actual currency and decreased 3% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $149 million decreased by 29% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue grew 23% versus the prior year, although some of this growth was attributable to accelerated shipments.
Moving now to our biosimilars business. Second quarter revenue of $202 million increased 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 9% at constant currency. This growth occurred despite our biosimilars business continuing to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as a slowdown in new treatments and reduced clinic capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued impact of COVID-19, we are now the leading anti-TNF provider in Europe. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the second quarter of $440 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. RITUXAN revenue decreased approximately 32% versus the prior year, partially offset by a 23% increase in OCREVUS royalties.
Second quarter gross margin was 83% of revenue, up slightly from 82% in the prior quarter and down from 89% in Q2 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. In addition, Q2 2020 includes approximately $330 million in revenue related to the onetime license of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property, which was at 100% gross margin. 
Moving now to expenses in the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $585 million, which included approximately $50 million of upfront payments related to 3 business development deals: One with Bio-Thera for biosimilars; a second with Capsigen in gene therapy; and a third with Ginkgo to develop a novel gene therapy manufacturing platform.
Second quarter non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $115 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A cost is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.
Second quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expenses by $15 million, which includes a reimbursement of $85 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S.
In the second quarter of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16% versus approximately 19% in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter non-GAAP income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $84 million includes a milestone payment of $100 million to Neurimmune, related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. Note that Eisai's 45% share of this milestone payment was recognized in the collaboration profit sharing line.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $450 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was $3.6 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 150 million shares for the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter was $5.68, which increased from $5.34 in Q1 of 2021.
In the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $72 million and free cash flow was approximately $1.2 billion. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as a result, $3.3 billion in net debt. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.
Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term.
Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.45 billion to $10.75 billion to a new range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion, primarily as a result of stronger performance in our MS franchise and higher OCREVUS royalties.
We are maintaining our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $17.50 to $19, notwithstanding the inclusion of the $125 million upfront payment related to our recently announced collaboration with InnoCare, which we expect to incur in Q3. This payment was not included in our previous guidance. Our CapEx guidance is unchanged at $375 million to $425 million.
Our guidance continues to assume modest ADUHELM revenue in 2021 due to dosing titration, the need for sites to prepare to diagnose and treat patients and the time that it will take to secure payer coverage. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond.
We expect continued erosion of both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S. and that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Note that our gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 83% of revenue, which reflects this dynamic.
Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This updated R&D guidance range includes the expected $125 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2021, which, as I mentioned, was not included in our prior guidance. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to include an approximate $600 million ADUHELM investment.
Of this amount, approximately $200 million would be reimbursable by Eisai, and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. Of course, as the launch progresses, we will actively manage the pace of the spend. This guidance continues to reflect our expectation that both R&D and SG&A will be higher in the second half of the year than they were in the first half due to collaborations, such as InnoCare, program readouts and investments in ADUHELM.
We expect we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $3.6 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities.
We assume that foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2021, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. We have not included any impact from potential tax or health care reform or any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions other than InnoCare in our guidance.
So in closing, we were very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

It is an exciting time at Biogen. And it is all about execution for the coming period. Our base MS, SMA, biosimilars business is performing well, demonstrating resilience despite competition. We have an incredible opportunity together with Eisai. And we are completely focused on operational execution for the global launch of ADUHELM, and hopefully soon, lecanemab.
We have positive Phase III data for zuranolone in depression. And we are anxiously awaiting data for tofersen in SOD1-ALS. We believe we have a significant value creation opportunity ahead of us. We stand behind the clinical data for ADUHELM, including the integrity of the approval process. Again, today, our top priority is patient access, including for the underserved population and those more at risk due to ethnicity. And we are open to innovative approaches to ensure budget sustainability.
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs.

It's still the beginning. And whatever the motives of the controversy are, the one who are potentially misled, confused, denied help are the patients. 
If we look at the past experience, progress has to be made with the first step. And we can look at HIV, oncology or MS, as Al said. And let me bring you back to early 1990s and HIV. The FDA approved a first product based on CD4 counts. And there were tremendous controversy. Then they were progressed on viral loads, and then survival. And then 29 products or so were approved until today. And today, it's managed HIV as a chronic disease. This came with tremendous investment in the field. And the importance of the biomarker is that it's often present prior to the clinical symptoms. And this situation, this scenario could very well be the same for AD. Where are those today who were fighting at that time the biomarker-based approval for HIV therapies a few years back? The same applies to oncology.

And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving.",956,"Yes. Thank you, Michel. And thank you, Michael, for the question. 
And though it is very early in our launch, I am happy to share with you a few critical areas that we've been monitoring that will provide some insights into how the landscape is evolving. I do have quite a bit to share however so I would ask that you please bear with me as I think I need to make it through some of these key topics that I believe you'll be very interested in. 
So let me first start with the patients. Physicians have definitely shared that since launch, there has been a significant amount of patient interest across the entire country, not only from their existing diagnosed patients that they are aware of, but also from new patient referrals from primary care physicians, which is also excellent. 
On the last call that we held, I did share that the primary focus of our team is to provide access to patients by supporting sites as they build the capability and infrastructure to treat patients. So sites are just now taking that first step in their internal process, which is to complete their P&T committee reviews. The majority of the Alzheimer's specialists that we have been talking to have been really extremely highly engaged with both our commercial and our medical teams as they operationalize their sites. We have seen several sites move faster than anticipated, which is also very good news for us. And as Michel mentioned in his opening, we estimate that 35% of the ready sites have completed a P&T review with a positive outcome or they've indicated that they're not requiring the step.  
As I'm sure you've also seen, a few centers have indicated that they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the AD specialists at these centers who had actually planned to treat their patients with ADUHELM. So our teams are making every attempt to get in front of the decision-makers in order to help them better understand the science and data. 
The AD specialists and the champions of these sites are also urging their sites to reconsider these decisions. Now remember though, many of these physicians can still prescribe the drug, and they have asked for support to find alternative sites where they can infuse their patients. We've also experienced during this time that patients and their families are not giving up, and they will seek new sites if necessary, and we are also seeing that in the field. Our field teams share the sense of urgency, of course. And as we've also said in a public statement, if any patient is denied access to care, we encourage them to contact our Biogen support services for help, and we will support them. 
Next, for the sites that have completed a positive P&T committee review or don't require one, there are still several steps to operationalize the complex patient journey. You might have seen recently published, several AD specialists recently said, building this infrastructure for the appropriate use of ADUHELM will require time, resources and some creative planning. In fact, I recently just visited several sites. And what I saw is consistent with what we're seeing across the entire country. 
Sites are currently right now developing their protocols. They are reengaging with their patients. They are considering or scheduling amyloid beta confirmation. They also are ordering baseline MRIs. Then they are discussing these results of the tests and making the treatment decision with their patients. This is clearly taking quite a bit of time. 
On our last call with you, we shared a program that we created with LabCorp and Mayo Clinical Labs to help physicians and patients access CSF diagnostic laboratory testing. We are also seeing a very strong interest in this program. In fact, we have already seen the first orders come in for both of our lab partners. 
Sites are also trying to gain clarity, as you said, on the reimbursement pathway. The decision by CMS to open an NCD analysis will help provide additional clarity to sites and health care providers. Now while this analysis is underway, coverage decisions will be made by regional Medicare administrative contractors, as you know as the MACs, and the Medicare Advantage Plans. Based on precedent, we expect the MACs and Medicare Advantage Plans will provide coverage for ADUHELM. Now while NCD for drugs are rare, and the only recent example of a drug NCD analysis, which was CAR-T, both MACs and Medicare Advantage Plans continued to cover these -- this product during the NCA process. 
We can also confirm that some Medicare Advantage Plans have already approved prior authorizations for ADUHELM. For the MACs, due to the miscellaneous coding, it does take them a little bit of time to process the claims, but we are also aware that MACs have received claims already. So during the NCD analysis, we're actively working with sites to support patient access and reimbursement. 
Keep in mind, and as I witnessed across the various sites that I visited, each site will operationalize at different rates, which is why patient infusions will build gradually over the year, as we've referenced. Though this process will take time, it was absolutely humbling to see how much effort and passion these physicians are putting into building the infrastructure to treat their patients. And I am really proud of how hard our teams are working to support these sites as they break new ground. Our teams are staying focused though, Michael. We have a job to do on behalf of the AD community, and we will not be distracted from that mission no matter what we see."

So first, there is a no-coverage decision. While this is theoretically an outcome, in the last 15 years, there are no examples of FDA-approved drugs not being covered. So I think that that's important to know. Second, there is coverage to indication or basically label. And third, you can have coverage with restrictions, so they can maybe give you restriction around specific population of patients, or they can limit prescribing potentially the specialists and they'll define who those specialists are. Fourth, you can have coverage with evidence development. And lastly, it can be left to the MAX discretion. 
So importantly, once a national coverage decision is made, all of the MAX and the Med Advantage Plans must abide by the NCD. Meaning the NCD will overrule any local or Medicare Advantage plan that is in place. That's why we believe NCD will drive some consistency of access and clear reimbursement expectations, which is actually very good for everyone since you know one of the questions that people had -- have are, is this going to be reimbursed? So with that being said, if there were to be a negative outcome, though we can't speculate on it, of course, in Biogen's true form, we would want to obviously have a conversation on that and see what other outcome potentially could happen depending on additional data they might need."

And since PDUFA, we have continued to hear a high level of interest in our ABC program, which I talked about prior, which is the CSF testing, which you heard me talked about in my first answer. 
Now the reason why there is a high interest is primarily due to 3 reasons. First, we're hearing a consistent message from the AD experts and the clinicians that they will align their patient selection to the patient population studied in our clinical trials. So 100% of patients in our clinical development program were confirmed for amyloid plaques. However, just you so also know, no one's really come out with a policy yet. So I can't actually tell you that there's been a mandate on amyloid beta confirmation, but we would expect that potentially those will be in the policies. 
Second, there is currently no reimbursed test to confirm the presence of amyloid and this program that we offer as a solution to provide access to patients who would otherwise lack the ability to pay for this lab test, let alone the cost of a PET scan. 
And as you know, for PET scanning, third, there are still several areas of the country, in particular, the Mountain West, Hawaii and Alaska, where access to amyloid PET is not available due to the distribution of radiopharmacies and the limited half-life of the radio ligand. But I also said on a prior call that we do need both PET and CSF. And we have seen these orders come in for both of our lab partners. And we are still working diligently with a coalition to see if we can get pet reimbursement through CMS."

But some of the smaller ones that are in our targeted sites coming on a daily basis, so I can't actually provide that accurate number. 
However, for the second part of your question, I can't comment on the decision-making process at the specific sites. However, I will say that we are disappointed that sites that have specialized in Alzheimer's disease have indicated they will not provide access to ADUHELM for now. This is not only disappointing for patients, but also for the 80 specialists at the sites, of course. 
Each site will have their own specific process and decision makers, so there's not really a single reason. And even the reasons that you might see publicly are slightly different from what we actually hear directly, which, again, causes even more confusion in the marketplace. And just so you know, we're making every attempt to get in front of these decision makers to help them better understand the science and data. And also, there have been specialists and champions at these sites to see if they can reconsider their current policy. 
But do remember that many of the physicians can still prescribe the product and have asked for support to find alternative sites so they can infuse their patients. With that being said, there are going to be other sites that look to these accounts to see what kind of policies and procedures that they do put in place depending on their decision-making. However, at the end of the day, these accounts have also said it is just for now. And there may be a potential opportunity to have them reconsider that in the very near future."

Today, we will be discussing ADUHELM. ADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial or trials. ADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but can be serious. ADUHELM can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects include ARIA, headache and fall. Please see full prescribing information and patient medication guide at aduhelm.com.

We continued to view 2021 as a transformational year for our company. We are satisfied with our 2021 pipeline accomplishments and the continued operational performance of the company. However, we are obviously disappointed with a delayed uptake of ADUHELM in the U.S. 
We had solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $4.77. Biogen has continued to execute well and demonstrate resilience across MS, SMA and biosimilars, despite competition. Mike will provide more details on our financial results, and I will focus primarily on ADUHELM. 
We continue to believe in ADUHELM long-term potential. And this quarter, we continued to progress the launch in the U.S. in anticipation of the reimbursement decision for Medicare patients. We are working through the 3 near-term challenges we have previously described, with a core focus on enabling patients access. Importantly, we have made steady progress on key metrics, but the health care system remains a major bottleneck. In particular, the lack of clarity on reimbursement has delayed patient access to the first treatment to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. We look forward to the upcoming Medicare national coverage determination expected by next April, which would clarify Medicare reimbursement for the entire class of antibodies directed against amyloid. The NCD is a rigorous process involving a number of consultation, and we understand this is required for this new class of drugs for Alzheimer's. However, keep in mind this will delay access for many patients by approximately 300 days from approval. 
Biogen is acting with urgency across the 3 strategic priorities as we work to support access for patients. 
First, we are working to improve the community's understanding of our clinical data. As a reminder, the Phase III EMERGE study met its prespecified primary and secondary endpoints, showing a significant reduction in clinical decline. Patients who received high dose ADUHELM experienced significant benefits on measure of cognition and function, including activities of daily living. Although the other Phase III study ENGAGE did not meet its primary endpoint, analysis for both studies demonstrated that higher exposure to ADUHELM associated with greater reduction in clinical decline. We have submitted these Phase III results to a top-tier journal, with a manuscript now under peer review in addition to other publication on our data. 
And we will continue to generate additional data. We launched Eye Care AD, the first real-world observational Phase IV study in Alzheimer's disease, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADUHELM in clinical practice. We have submitted a draft protocol to the FDA for the required Phase IV confirmatory study. We have fully resourced this study with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule. 
In addition to presenting ADUHELM data at this year's AIC meeting, the EMBARK baseline data have been accepted for presentation at next month's CTAD meeting, which will provide important information regarding the impact of a gap in treatment. Furthermore, we also plan to present important new plasma phospho-related tau data from EMERGE AND ENGAGE that highlighted the downstream effect of aducanumab as soon as possible. 
Overall, the approval of ADUHELM was supported by a significant data set from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients, and we look forward to continuing to generate additional data to support the clinical profile of ADUHELM. 
Our second priority is to appropriately support development of the necessary infrastructure. At launch, we established a program with LabCorp and Mayo Clinic Laboratories for amyloid beta TSR testing. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuous increase in the number of patients utilizing this program. We also continued to advocate for reimbursement of amyloid PET imaging. Furthermore, we are continuing to see additional sites come online, with approximately 120 sites now treating patients with ADUHELM and many more sites in progress. 
And third, to clarify reimbursement as we wait the NCD decision for this class of antibodies, we have obtained the permanent ADUHELM J-code becoming active in January of next year and hope this will help simplify the coding process for health care providers. 
Looking forward, in addition to presenting and publishing the data that I previously mentioned, the most significant near-term milestones will be the outcome of the NCD for antibodies directed against amyloid. We expect a draft decision in January following by a final decision in April of 2022. 
In Alzheimer's, more broadly, our partner SI recently initiated the FDA rolling submission for lecanemab BLA under the accelerated approval pathway following the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. Of the anti-amyloid antibodies that are either approved or in late-stage development, Biogen and SI have the opportunity to provide patients with 2 out of the 4 potential options. 
With the first FDA-approved therapy to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the potential to bring lecanemab, promising tau pipeline programs such as BAT, and with the benefit of digital technologies, we believe Biogen is well positioned to remain a long-term leader in Alzheimer's disease. 
Moving beyond Alzheimer's disease, together with our partners at Sage, we continue to make progress towards bringing a potential novotherapeutic options to patients suffering from depression. We recently obtained positive data from a Phase II study in Japan representing the third positive placebo-controlled study for zuranolone in MDD. In addition, we announced our plans to initiate a filing in the U.S. 
Lastly, we recently reported data from the VALOR Phase III study of tofersen in ALS. Although the VALOR study did not meet the primary endpoint, signs of reduced disease progression across multiple endpoints were observed. We are encouraged by the totality of the evidence and are engaged with the regulators on next steps. Following discussion with investigators, bioethicists, and having listened to the voice of patients advocacy groups, we intend to expand the early access program to the broader population of individuals living with SOD1-ALS. We believe this recent developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multi-franchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas.

As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. 
In addition to key readouts in major depressive disorder and ALS, we hosted an R&D Investor Day to tell you about our pipeline programs, research capabilities and expertise. I encourage you to take a look at these presentations on our website. 
Let me now start with Alzheimer's disease, beginning with aducanumab. 
At the R&D Day presentation earlier this month, I underscored the importance of determining the relationship between drug to biology as well as biology to disease during the drug development process. 
In late June, FDA made data from the drug approval package of ADUHELM publicly available. The clinical pharmacology review included in the approval package addresses some of these key relationships, as shown in the next 2 slides. 
This first slide shows the relationship between the amyloid plaque burden as measured by the observed SUVR score versus drug exposure as measured by the predicted cumulative AUC, both at week 78, taking into account all of the data from both Phase III trials of aducanumab. The relationship between exposure to aducanumab and amyloid plaque reduction is consistent across the 2 studies and shows that amyloid plaque burden decreases as the cumulative drug exposure increases. 
The next slide shows another figure from the same document, which plots the relationship between the reduction in amyloid plaque burden, as measured by SUVR, and the preservation of clinical function, as measured by the CDR Summit boxes, across multiple dose levels of several anti-Abeta antibodies. Studies 301 and 302 are referred to as Study 2 and Study 1, respectively, in the ADUHELM label. 
When viewed together, these data from 6 different anti-amyloid antibodies show that there is an association between amyloid plaque reduction and a reduction in clinical decline, and that greater degrees of amyloid plaque reduction are needed for a reduction in clinical decline. 
At the annual AAIC meeting in July, we presented additional data from the EMERGE, ENGAGE and PRIME trials, which showed that aducanumab treatment led to a reduction in amyloid plaques as well as downstream biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, and that this also led to a slowing of clinical decline. 
We are looking forward to presenting more data from our aducanumab trials, including the baseline data from the EMBARK study at the upcoming CTAD meeting next month in Boston. We're also looking forward to presenting at the earliest possible opportunity at a scientific venue new data on plasma P181 tau, reflecting the downstream biological and clinical effects of aducanumab, which I believe will be of great interest to scientists and clinicians. 
By a way of reminder, amyloid plaques containing Abeta protein and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau are the defining pathophysiologic features of Alzheimer's disease. 
Finally, I'm happy to say that we are on track to soon publish the Phase III aducanumab trial results in a major peer-reviewed journal. 
This quarter, we also submitted a draft protocol for the required Phase IV confirmatory trial of aducanumab to the FDA. As I have said before, we have fully resourced the study and aim to complete it ahead of schedule. A key goal of the confirmatory study is to ensure that we enroll appropriate numbers of Alzheimer's disease patients from underrepresented populations. It is estimated that by 2030, nearly 40% of all Americans living with Alzheimer's disease will be African American or Latin X, and therefore, having sufficient participation of these communities is especially important to reflect the diversity of the disease in the real world. Through the Phase IV confirmatory study as well as Eye Care AD, we aim to provide further evidence of the clinical benefits and risks associated with aducanumab treatment. 
Outside of the United States, we are under regulatory review in multiple geographies, including the EU, where we are actively preparing for a scientific advisory group meeting as part of the CHMP review process. 
Turning to lucanumab. We are looking forward to when we can potentially provide 2 anti-amyloid antibody options for Alzheimer's disease patients. As previously announced, our collaboration partner, Eisai, recently initiated a rolling submission of the lucanumab data to the FDA for potential accelerated approval. We expect this submission to be complete sometime in 2022. 
Moving to MS. We presented new data at the annual ECTRIMS meeting last week, including primary results from the NOVA Phase IIb study, evaluating the efficacy of TYSABRI extended interval dosing versus the approved every 4-week dosing. A real-world claims-based analysis of relapse and hospitalization rates in MS patients treated with natalizumab versus ocrelizumab, a new analysis of the EVOLVE-MS-2 data focusing on the impact of dose titration on the GI tolerability of VUMERITY relative to TECFIDERA, and data from the MS path showing that 100% of people with MS treated with natalizumab, interferons or fumarates achieved an antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination as compared to 40% of MS patients treated with anti-CD20 or S1P therapies. 
With respect to the introduction of VUMERITY in the EU, we were happy to learn of the approval in Switzerland as well as the positive CHMP opinion, and look forward to the final EMA decision. 
In neuropsychiatry, we were excited to see the results of the Phase II study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder recently completed by Shionogi. The Phase II trial was similar in design to the other studies evaluating zuranolone and MDD and compared 20- and 30-milligram doses of zuranolone to placebo in Japanese patients with MDD. The results of this study further support the safety and efficacy profile of zuranolone in that it demonstrated rapid onset and significant reductions in the HAM-D17 score at day 3, day 8 and day 15. Additionally, while not statistically significant, we see separation from placebo for both the 20 and 30 milligrams zuranolone treatment arms out to day 57. All adverse events in the study were mild to moderate and consistent with the known safety profile of zuranolone. The Shionogi study is now the third double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating zuranolone in MDD, where the primary endpoint of the change in the HAM-D score at day 15 was met. These results in MDD are in addition to the efficacy of zuranolone in PPD as observed in the Robin study. 
Given the consistent results observed across the zuranolone trials, Biogen and Sage have announced plans to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2022. The planned initial submission package will be used to seek approval of zuranolone for the treatment of major depressive disorder and an additional filing for postpartum depression is anticipated in the first half of 2023. Additionally, the CORAL study designed to evaluate zuranolone as an acute rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressant therapy is now fully enrolled, with top line data expected in early 2022. 
Moving to neuromuscular disorders. Earlier this week, we announced results from the pivotal Phase III study evaluating to a person in people with SOD1 mediated ALS. The Phase III or VALOR study utilized the study enrichment approach to stratify participants into faster and slower progressing cohorts. 
We were disappointed to learn that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline to week 28 in the ALS functional rating scale in the faster progressing population. Nevertheless, we did observe encouraging trends favoring tofersen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biological and clinical activity, including assessments of motor function, respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life. Moreover, a prespecified integration of data from the Phase III study and its ongoing open-label extension study reinforced these findings and showed that early to first in initiation led to a slower decline across these measures. 
Beyond the clinical measures, we observed reductions in CSF SOD1 as compared to placebo, suggesting target engagement was achieved. Moreover, on the key secondary endpoint of a change in plasma neurofilament light, a potential marker of neuronal degeneration, we observed reductions of 67% in the faster progressing patients and 40% -- 48% in the slower progressing patients with tofersen treatment relative to placebo. To our knowledge, this represents the greatest reductions in plasma neurofilament levels ever observed in an ALS clinical trial. Most adverse events in the Phase III study were mild to moderate in severity and many were consistent with ALS disease progression or lumbar puncture-related events. Serious adverse events, including transverse myelitis, were seen in some patients receiving tofersen. 
Based on the results of the Phase III study, we are actively engaging regulators, the medical community, patient advocacy groups and other key stakeholders around the world to determine next steps for tofersen. Additionally, following discussions with key medical experts and ethicists, we plan to provide early access of tofersen to all eligible SOD1 ALS patients through an expanded access program. 
Given the possible importance of early treatment of SOD1 ALS, we continued to enroll patients in the ATLAS study, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating patients earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease. 
Also, in neuromuscular disorders, this quarter, we announced our plans to initiate ASCEND, a Phase IIIb study, which aims to evaluate whether treatment with an investigational higher dose of nusinersen has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients previously treated with risdiplam. Our SPINRAZA data indicate that exposure remains similar as patients age and grow. We're also advancing the ongoing DEVOTE study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of higher exposures of SPINRAZA, as our preclinical studies indicate that we ought to be able to safely increase its dose. With the DEVOTE and ASCEND studies, we hope to be able to further inform SMA treatment and address the remaining unmet needs of patients. 
In summary, as I described during our recent R&D Investor Day, we believe the science is breaking and that this is exactly the right time to be pioneers in neuroscience. By leveraging a deep understanding of human genetics and disease biology, we are working to usher in the future of neurotherapeutics, where we identify the right patients and treat early, perhaps even before the onset of symptoms, to meaningfully delay or even prevent disease progression. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

We are very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to execute well. As we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business, including the launch of ADUHELM in the United States. 
Total revenue for the third quarter of $2.8 billion declined 18% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency and reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics. Total MS revenue for the third quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties. 
Looking at some of the individual products within MS. 
Global TECFIDERA revenue for the third quarter was $499 million. In the U.S., third quarter revenue of $179 million was flat versus the prior quarter, with lower volume offset by a decrease in discounts and allowances. We expect TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. to decline going forward. Outside of the U.S., third quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $319 million increased by 13% versus the prior year, with 7% underlying patient growth. 
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $91 million in the second quarter to $121 million in the third quarter. We are also pleased that VUMERITY received a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as full regulatory approval in Switzerland. 
TYSABRI third quarter global revenue of $523 million increased 1% versus the prior year, notwithstanding some negative channel dynamics in the United States. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS, with initiatives including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. We are also encouraged by the new data on COVID vaccinations that Al mentioned. 
Moving to SMA. 
Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $444 million decreased by 10% versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $140 million decreased by 23% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. However, we were encouraged to see that discontinuations decreased versus the second quarter of this year. Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year due to competition and pricing pressure in Europe, partially offset by growth in regions outside of Europe. As a reminder, Q1 and Q2 2021 SPINRAZA revenue outside the U.S. benefited from accelerated shipments. 
With overall market growth, continued data generation, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups and further geographic expansion, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth over the medium to long term. 
Total ADUHELM revenue for the third quarter was $300,000 as we saw wholesalers gradually draw down inventory purchased in Q2. For the 3 main reasons Michel discussed, uptake has been delayed. I would refer you to this slide as well as slides in the appendix for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune, which differs depending on geography. 
Moving on to our biosimilars business. 
Third quarter revenue of $203 million decreased by 2% versus the prior year as we continued to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are excited that BIoVIS was approved in the U.S., EU and U.K. and believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow our biosimilars business by commercializing new products and entering new geographies such as the U.S. 
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the third quarter of $415 million decreased 26% versus the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by the decline in Rituxan revenue as we see continued impact from biosimilars, a trend that we expect going forward. 
Total other revenue in the third quarter of $158 million increased 26% versus the prior year. Other revenue in the quarter benefited from the timing of shipments related to contract manufacturing. 
Third quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue, down slightly from 83% in the prior quarter and down from 87% in Q3 of 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. We expect continued downward pressure on gross margins going forward. 
Moving now to expenses on the balance sheet. 
Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $702 million, which included a $125 million upfront payment related to our collaboration with InnoCare. Non-GAAP SG&A was $651 million, including approximately $135 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A costs is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. 
Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $21 million, which includes a reimbursement of $51 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. 
Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 14% versus approximately 19% in the third quarter of last year. 
Third quarter non-GAAP loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $11 million. As a reminder, ADUHELM royalties and commercial launch milestones paid to Neurimmune will be reflected in this line. Eisai's reimbursement for these items will be reflected in collaboration profit sharing. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for $750 million. As of September 30, 2021, there was $2.8 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 149 million shares for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $4.77. 
In the third quarter, we generated approximately $805 million in cash flow from operations. CapEx was $42 million and free cash flow was approximately $763 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of Q3. 
Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term. 
And let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. 
We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion to a new range of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion, primarily as a result of stronger MS performance. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17.50 to $19 to a new range of $18.85 to $19.35, primarily driven by the revenue upside I just mentioned. We are lowering our capital expenditure guidance from a previous range of $375 million to $425 million to a new range of $250 million to $300 million, primarily as a result of delayed spend on certain projects, including some which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our guidance assumes minimal ADUHELM revenue in 2021. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond, particularly after the NCD decision in April, assuming a positive outcome. We expect continued declines in both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S., and that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. 
Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and includes an approximate $500 million ADUHELM investment. Of this amount, approximately $150 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. These ADUHELM investments are slightly less than our previous estimates, and of course, we will continue to actively manage the pace of this spend. This annual SG&A range also assumes a seasonally higher spend in Q4, consistent with previous years. 
I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our financial performance and are very focused on the ADUHELM launch. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

Biogen continued to demonstrate resilience and strong execution in the third quarter of the year, providing a solid foundation for the company as we make progress on the ADUHELM launch ahead of the important data releases and publications, in addition to the NCD decision for the class of anti-amyloid antibodies anticipated next April. 
We believe ADUHELM presents a significant step in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as the first FDA-approved treatment to address the defined pathology of the disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. We know there are patients suffering right now from the disease. And it is those patients we keep in mind as we work to support access. In fact, at the CTAD meeting next month, we'll be presenting an analysis showing that without access, every day that passes, we estimate that over 1,000 Americans move from mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia, and therefore, may no longer be appropriate for initiation of treatment with ADUHELM. As many have observed our current system so far falls short in diagnosing and intervening in the disease. 
In addition, Alzheimer's disease is a particularly acute issue of inequality, as African Americans are up to 3x more likely and Latinx individuals are 1.5x more likely to have Alzheimer's disease when compared to others. We understand the seriousness of this issue. And that inclusion of underrepresented population in drug development is often low, including in our Alzheimer's clinical trial. We also know that we have work to do and a role to play in correcting this. For that reason, the design of iCare AD, our real-world Phase IV observational study of ADUHELM, aims to include at least 16% of the trials is expected enrollment from Black, African-American and Latinx patients. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated the dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our ability to deliver medicines to patients could not be realized without the passion and commitment.

This is actually not an exact science. And what we believe and what we are hearing is that the majority of prescribers actually fall into a combination of 2 categories. The first is going to be around the benefit/risk profile, which, of course, you are reading about and the question refers to. And the second is also what we refer to, which is the hesitancy due to the NCD analysis. However, there are a meaningful portion of prescribers that are still undecided. So those are some of the headlines. We do have a very large bucket that haven't made a decision one way or another. And This is why we have multiple teams working every single day and working very hard to help educate sites and HCPs in our clinical data and on the reimbursement pathways, which you know are very complex. 
And Michel referenced this also in his opening statements, but we're working with urgency because the cost of doing nothing is also well understood. And Michel mentioned that we estimate that 1,000 patients a day advance in their Alzheimer's journey from mild to moderate AD and they may no longer be appropriate for ADUHELM. So we are really committed to being a part of the solution, and that's what motivates us each and every day.

The second is going to be coverage with evidence, which we call CED. And the other will be covered with restrictions.

But first is data, and data is interrelated, obviously, with the decision for NCD. And infrastructure is also in the meantime progressing.

Thank you, Michel, and thank you, Cory, for the question. 
And Michel's absolutely right. While price is always an important factor for sites and for patients, what I can share with you is that we have not heard that price is the primary driver for any decision not to treat patients. In fact, the headwinds on that we're facing are the ones Michel has mentioned and that you clearly also read in the press every day and you probably see when you are reporting with your analyst report. But as with other therapies, if patients think they might face difficulty affording ADUHELM, we do have financial assistant programs that are available that can help these patients. So if reimbursement or affordability are potential concerns, we hope that our programs can provide really a potential pathway for them, because we do believe that a lack of financial means should not be a barrier for patients to access ADUHELM."

So there will be a lot of education necessary assuming we do get approval. 
The -- I think that the current standard of care is to use SSRIs or SNRIs. It takes weeks if not more than a month for them to work. And then patients stay on them chronically often with side effects. And that's not a great situation. And the reason why people stay on them chronically is because they're slow onset of action. So having a 2-week treatment course where you can then take the drug as needed is a very different way of thinking and I think would be attractive to many treating physicians. And the fact that it's rapid onset allows people to give the 2-week treatment and wait for the next as needed treatment because they know, they can be reassured that within 3 days of starting, they see efficacy -- they will see efficacy in their patients. So it is a different way of thinking, but I think it's very, very exciting."

The difference? There are more similarities than differences between aducanumab and lecanemab. Both bind to aggregated forms of Abeta. Both reduce amyloid plaque burden quite substantially. The differences are that there's no titration needed for lecanemab. And the rates of ARIA at the present time do seem to be low. We'll find out in the Phase III study, but they seem to be lower than the rates of ARIA with aducanumab. And it's given every 2 weeks. So -- and look, the design of the Phase III trial, to your question, is very similar to the design of the aducanumab Phase III trials. For example, the primary endpoint is CDR Summit boxes, which is the established clinical efficacy measure for this disease."

We don't have great visibility to patient counts, which is why we don't comment on them publicly, but we did give you -- we can't say that the sites are continuing to progress. We're at approximately 120 sites now that have infused at least one patient, which is more than double what it was about 6 weeks ago. And we're going to continue to monitor those metrics, and we'll ramp it as quickly as we can. But because of all the pieces, that does cause a bit of a delay. 
And then the other important thing to remember is titration. So to the extent that we get through a successful NCD, there is still patient titration and dosing levels that need to ramp up. And so the revenue ramp is going to be gradual. But the important takeaway is that over the long term, we continue to believe that it's a very meaningful multibillion dollar opportunity."

But when you think about our original strategy, which was focusing on the sites where the majority of our patient population have already been diagnosed, you do remember that over 900 sites were ready. So we believe that once we, of course, get our additional data out, we share our data and the NCD outcome is finalized, those are going to be the majority of the sites that we will continue to focus on to get them up and running and get patients through the system."

Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.
I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.  
Today, we will be discussing ADUHELM. ADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial or trials. 
ADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but can be serious. ADUHELM can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects include ARIA, headache and fall. Please see full prescribing information and patient medication guide at aduhelm.com.  
On today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Al Sandrock, Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell.

We are satisfied with our 2021 pipeline accomplishments and the continued operational performance of the company. However, we are obviously disappointed with the delayed uptake of ADUHELM in the U.S. 
We had solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $4.77. Biogen has continued to execute well and demonstrate resilience across MS, SMA and biosimilars, despite competition. Mike will provide more details on our financial results, and I will focus primarily on ADUHELM.  
We continue to believe in ADUHELM long-term potential. And this quarter, we continued to progress the launch in the U.S. in anticipation of the reimbursement decision for Medicare patients. We are working through the 3 near-term challenges we have previously described, with a core focus on enabling patients access. 
Importantly, we have made steady progress on key metrics, but the health care system remains a major bottleneck. In particular, the lack of clarity on reimbursement has delayed patient access to the first treatment to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. 
We look forward to the upcoming Medicare national coverage determination expected by next April, which would clarify Medicare reimbursement for the entire class of antibodies directed against amyloid. The NCD is a rigorous process involving a number of consultation, and we understand this is required for this new class of drugs for Alzheimer's. However, keep in mind this will delay access for many patients by approximately 300 days from approval.  
Biogen is acting with urgency across the 3 strategic priorities as we work to support access for patients. First, we are working to improve the community's understanding of our clinical data. As a reminder, the Phase III EMERGE study met its prespecified primary and secondary end points, showing a significant reduction in clinical decline. Patients who received high-dose ADUHELM experienced significant benefits on measure of cognition and function, including activities of daily living. 
Although the other Phase III study, ENGAGE, did not meet its primary end point, analysis for both studies demonstrated that higher exposure to ADUHELM were associated with greater reduction in clinical decline. We have submitted these Phase III results to a top-tier journal, with a manuscript now under peer review in addition to other publication on our data. 
And we will continue to generate additional data. We launched ICARE AD, the first real-world observational Phase IV study in Alzheimer's disease designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADUHELM in clinical practice. We have submitted a draft protocol to the FDA for the required Phase IV confirmatory study. We have fully resourced this study with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule.  
In addition to presenting ADUHELM data at this year's AAIC meeting, the EMBARK baseline data have been accepted for presentation at next month's CTAD meeting, which will provide important information regarding the impact of a gap in treatment. Furthermore, we also plan to present important new plasma phosphorylated tau data from EMERGE and ENGAGE that highlight the downstream effect of aducanumab as soon as possible. Overall, the approval of ADUHELM was supported by a significant data set from 8 studies with more than 3,000 patients, and we look forward to continuing to generate additional data to support the clinical profile of ADUHELM.  
Our second priority is to appropriately support development of the necessary infrastructure. At launch, we established a program with Labcorp and Mayo Clinic Laboratories for amyloid beta CSF testing. Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuous increase in the number of patients utilizing this program. We also continued to advocate for reimbursement of amyloid PET imaging. Furthermore, we are continuing to see additional sites come online, with approximately 120 sites now treating patients with ADUHELM and many more sites in progress.
And third, to clarify reimbursement as we wait the NCD decision for this class of antibodies, we have obtained the permanent ADUHELM J-code, becoming active in January of next year, and hope this will help simplify the coding process for health care providers. Looking forward, in addition to presenting and publishing the data that I previously mentioned, the most significant near-term milestone will be the outcome of the NCD for antibodies directed against amyloid. We expect a draft decision in January, following by a final decision in April of 2022.  
In Alzheimer's more broadly, our partner, Eisai, recently initiated the FDA rolling submission for lecanemab BLA under the accelerated approval pathway following the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. Of the anti-amyloid antibodies that are either approved or in late-stage development, Biogen and Eisai have the opportunity to provide patients with 2 out of the 4 potential options. With the first FDA-approved therapy to address an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the potential to bring lecanemab, promising tau pipeline programs such as BIIB080, and with the benefit of digital technologies, we believe Biogen is well positioned to remain a long-term leader in Alzheimer's disease.  
Moving beyond Alzheimer's disease, together with our partners at Sage, we continue to make progress towards bringing potential novel therapeutic options to patients suffering from depression. We recently obtained positive data from a Phase II study in Japan representing the third positive placebo-controlled study for zuranolone in MDD. In addition, we announced our plans to initiate a filing in the U.S.  
Lastly, we recently reported data from the VALOR Phase III study of tofersen in ALS. Although the VALOR study did not meet the primary end point, signs of reduced disease progression across multiple end points were observed. We are encouraged by the totality of the evidence and are engaged with the regulators on next steps. 
Following discussion with investigators, bioethicists and having listened to the voice of patient advocacy groups, we intend to expand the early access program to the broader population of individuals living with SOD1-ALS. We believe this recent developments represent a significant step forward in our goal of transforming Biogen from what was once an MS company to one that is built upon a multi-franchise portfolio across a broad spectrum of neuroscience therapeutic areas.  
I would now like to turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our progress in R&D."

As always, I'd like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their hard work as we continue to advance our R&D programs. In addition to key readouts in major depressive disorder and ALS, we hosted an R&D Investor Day to tell you about our pipeline programs, research capabilities and expertise. I encourage you to take a look at these presentations on our website.
Let me now start with Alzheimer's disease, beginning with aducanumab. At the R&D Day presentation earlier this month, I underscored the importance of determining the relationship between drug to biology as well as biology to disease during the drug development process. In late June, FDA made data from the drug approval package of ADUHELM publicly available. The clinical pharmacology review included in the approval package addresses some of these key relationships, as shown in the next 2 slides.  
This first slide shows the relationship between the amyloid plaque burden, as measured by the observed SUVR score, versus drug exposure, as measured by the predicted cumulative AUC, both at week 78, taking into account all of the data from both Phase III trials of aducanumab. The relationship between exposure to aducanumab and amyloid plaque reduction is consistent across the 2 studies and shows that amyloid plaque burden decreases as the cumulative drug exposure increases.  
The next slide shows another figure from the same document, which plots the relationship between the reduction in amyloid plaque burden, as measured by SUVR, and the preservation of clinical function, as measured by the CDR Sum of Boxes across multiple dose levels of several anti-Abeta antibodies. Studies 301 and 302 are referred to as Study 2 and Study 1, respectively, in the ADUHELM label.  
When viewed together, these data from 6 different anti-amyloid antibodies show that there is an association between amyloid plaque reduction and a reduction in clinical decline. And that greater degrees of amyloid plaque reduction are needed for a reduction in clinical decline.
At the annual AAIC meeting in July, we presented additional data from the EMERGE, ENGAGE and PRIME trials, which showed that aducanumab treatment led to a reduction in amyloid plaques as well as downstream biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, and that this also led to a slowing of clinical decline. We are looking forward to presenting more data from our aducanumab trials, including the baseline data from the EMBARK study at the upcoming CTAD meeting next month in Boston. We're also looking forward to presenting at the earliest possible opportunity at a scientific venue new data on plasma P181 tau, reflecting the downstream biological and clinical effects of aducanumab, which I believe will be of great interest to scientists and clinicians. 
By a way of reminder, amyloid plaques containing Abeta protein and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau are the defining pathophysiologic features of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, I'm happy to say that we are on track to soon publish the Phase III aducanumab trial results in a major peer-reviewed journal. 
This quarter, we also submitted a draft protocol for the required Phase IV confirmatory trial of aducanumab to the FDA. As I have said before, we have fully resourced the study and aim to complete it ahead of schedule. A key goal of the confirmatory study is to ensure that we enroll appropriate numbers of Alzheimer's disease patients from underrepresented populations. It is estimated that by 2030, nearly 40% of all Americans living with Alzheimer's disease will be African American or Latinx and, therefore, having sufficient participation of these communities is especially important to reflect the diversity of the disease in the real world. 
Through the Phase IV confirmatory study as well as ICARE AD, we aim to provide further evidence of the clinical benefits and risks associated with aducanumab treatment. Outside of the United States, we are under regulatory review in multiple geographies, including the EU, where we are actively preparing for a scientific advisory group meeting as part of the CHMP review process.  
Turning to lecanemab. We are looking forward to when we can potentially provide 2 anti-amyloid antibody options for Alzheimer's disease patients. As previously announced, our collaboration partner, Eisai, recently initiated a rolling submission of the lecanemab data to the FDA for potential accelerated approval. We expect this submission to be complete sometime in 2022. 
Moving to MS. We presented new data at the annual ECTRIMS meeting last week, including: primary results from the NOVA Phase IIIb study evaluating the efficacy of TYSABRI extended interval dosing versus the approved every 4-week dosing; a real-world, claims-based analysis of relapse and hospitalization rates in MS patients treated with natalizumab versus ocrelizumab; a new analysis of the EVOLVE-MS-2 data focusing on the impact of dose titration on the GI tolerability of VUMERITY relative to TECFIDERA; and data from the MS PATHS showing that 100% of people with MS treated with natalizumab, interferons or fumarates achieved an antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination as compared to 40% of MS patients treated with anti-CD20 or S1P therapies. With respect to the introduction of VUMERITY in the EU, we were happy to learn of the approval in Switzerland as well as the positive CHMP opinion, and look forward to the final EMA decision.  
In neuropsychiatry, we were excited to see the results of the Phase II study of zuranolone in major depressive disorder recently completed by Shionogi. The Phase II trial was similar in design to the other studies evaluating zuranolone and MDD and compared 20 and 30 milligram doses of zuranolone to placebo in Japanese patients with MDD. The results of this study further support the safety and efficacy profile of zuranolone in that it demonstrated rapid onset and significant reductions in the HAM-D17 score at day 3, day 8 and day 15. Additionally, while not statistically significant, we see separation from placebo for both the 20 and 30 milligram zuranolone treatment arms out to day 57. 
All adverse events in the study were mild to moderate and consistent with the known safety profile of zuranolone. The Shionogi study is now the third double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating zuranolone in MDD where the primary end point of the change in the HAM-D score at day 15 was met. These results in MDD are in addition to the efficacy of zuranolone in PPD as observed in the ROBIN study. 
Given the consistent results observed across the zuranolone trials, Biogen and Sage have announced plans to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2022. The planned initial submission package will be used to seek approval of zuranolone for the treatment of major depressive disorder, and an additional filing for postpartum depression is anticipated in the first half of 2023. Additionally, the CORAL study, designed to evaluate zuranolone as an acute rapid response therapy when co-initiated with standard antidepressant therapy, is now fully enrolled with top line data expected in early 2022.  
Moving to neuromuscular disorders. Earlier this week, we announced results from the pivotal Phase III study evaluating tofersen in people with SOD1-mediated ALS. The Phase III, or VALOR study, utilized a study-enrichment approach to stratify participants into faster and slower progressing cohorts. 
We were disappointed to learn that the study did not meet the primary end point of a statistically significant change from baseline to week 28 in the ALS Functional Rating Scale in the faster-progressing population. Nevertheless, we did observe encouraging trends favoring tofersen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biological and clinical activity, including assessments of motor function, respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life. Moreover, a prespecified integration of data from the Phase III study and its ongoing open-label extension study reinforced these findings and showed that early tofersen initiation led to a slower decline across these measures.
Beyond the clinical measures, we observed reductions in CSF SOD1 as compared to placebo, suggesting target engagement was achieved. Moreover, on the key secondary end point of a change in plasma neurofilament light, a potential marker of neuronal degeneration, we observed reductions of 67% in the faster-progressing patients and 40% -- 48% in the slower-progressing patients with tofersen treatment relative to placebo. To our knowledge, this represents the greatest reductions in plasma neurofilament levels ever observed in an ALS clinical trial. 
Most adverse events in the Phase III study were mild to moderate in severity and many were consistent with ALS disease progression or lumbar puncture-related events. Serious adverse events, including transverse myelitis, were seen in some patients receiving tofersen.  
Based on the results of the Phase III study, we are actively engaging regulators, the medical community, patient advocacy groups and other key stakeholders around the world to determine next steps for tofersen. Additionally, following discussions with key medical experts and ethicists, we plan to provide early access of tofersen to all eligible SOD1-ALS patients through an expanded access program.  
Given the possible importance of early treatment of SOD1-ALS, we continued to enroll patients in the ATLAS study, a Phase III trial of tofersen initiated in clinically presymptomatic SOD1 mutation carriers. Our hope is that treating patients earlier in the disease may provide the best opportunity to slow or even delay the onset of this terrible disease.  
Also, in neuromuscular disorders, this quarter, we announced our plans to initiate ASCEND, a Phase IIIb study, which aims to evaluate whether treatment with an investigational higher dose of nusinersen has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients previously treated with risdiplam. Our SPINRAZA data indicate that exposure remains similar as patients age and grow. We're also advancing the ongoing DEVOTE study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of higher exposures of SPINRAZA, as our preclinical studies indicate that we ought to be able to safely increase its dose. With the DEVOTE and ASCEND studies, we hope to be able to further inform SMA treatment and address the remaining unmet needs of patients.
In summary, as I described during our recent R&D Investor Day, we believe the science is breaking and that this is exactly the right time to be pioneers in neuroscience. By leveraging a deep understanding of human genetics and disease biology, we are working to usher in the future of neurotherapeutics, where we identify the right patients and treat early, perhaps even before the onset of symptoms, to meaningfully delay or even prevent disease progression.  
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

We are very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to execute well. As we move forward, we remain fully focused on our core business, including the launch of ADUHELM in the United States. 
Total revenue for the third quarter of $2.8 billion declined 18% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency and reflects the impact of TECFIDERA generics. Total MS revenue for the third quarter was $1.8 billion, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties.  
Looking at some of the individual products within MS. Global TECFIDERA revenue for the third quarter was $499 million. In the U.S., third quarter revenue of $179 million was flat versus the prior quarter, with lower volume offset by a decrease in discounts and allowances. We expect TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. to decline going forward. Outside of the U.S., third quarter TECFIDERA revenue of $319 million increased by 13% versus the prior year, with 7% underlying patient growth.
We were pleased with the continued ramp in VUMERITY revenue from $91 million in the second quarter to $121 million in the third quarter. We are also pleased that VUMERITY received a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as full regulatory approval in Switzerland.
TYSABRI third quarter global revenue of $523 million increased 1% versus the prior year, notwithstanding some negative channel dynamics in the United States. We were pleased to see 7% growth in global TYSABRI patients. And we believe TYSABRI remains well positioned to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of MS, with initiatives including subcutaneous administration and extended interval dosing. We are also encouraged by the new data on COVID vaccinations that Al mentioned.  
Moving to SMA. Global third quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $444 million decreased by 10% versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $140 million decreased by 23% versus the prior year as we see continued impact from competition. However, we were encouraged to see that discontinuations decreased versus the second quarter of this year. 
Outside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year due to competition and pricing pressure in Europe, partially offset by growth in regions outside of Europe. As a reminder, Q1 and Q2 2021 SPINRAZA revenue outside the U.S. benefited from accelerated shipments. With overall market growth, continued data generation, the efficacy and safety profile in all age groups and further geographic expansion, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth over the medium to long term.  
Total ADUHELM revenue for the third quarter was $300,000 as we saw wholesalers gradually draw down inventory purchased in Q2. For the 3 main reasons Michel discussed, uptake has been delayed. I would refer you to this slide as well as slides in the appendix for details on the accounting with Eisai and Neurimmune, which differs depending on geography.  
Moving on to our biosimilars business. Third quarter revenue of $203 million decreased by 2% versus the prior year as we continued to be negatively impacted by pricing pressure as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are excited that BYOOVIZ was approved in the U.S., EU and U.K. and believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow our biosimilars business by commercializing new products and entering new geographies such as the U.S.
Total anti-CD20 revenue in the third quarter of $415 million decreased 26% versus the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by the decline in RITUXAN revenue as we see continued impact from biosimilars, a trend that we expect going forward. Total other revenue in the third quarter of $158 million increased 26% versus the prior year. Other revenue in the quarter benefited from the timing of shipments related to contract manufacturing.  
Third quarter gross margin was 82% of revenue, down slightly from 83% in the prior quarter and down from 87% in Q3 of 2020. The reduction in gross margin versus the prior year was primarily due to the declines in TECFIDERA and RITUXAN, both of which are high-margin products. We expect continued downward pressure on gross margins going forward.  
Moving now to expenses and the balance sheet. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $702 million, which included a $125 million upfront payment related to our collaboration with InnoCare. Non-GAAP SG&A was $651 million, including approximately $135 million related to ADUHELM. Note that beginning in the second quarter, Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A costs is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.  
Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $21 million, which includes a reimbursement of $51 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 14% versus approximately 19% in the third quarter of last year.  
Third quarter non-GAAP loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $11 million. As a reminder, ADUHELM royalties and commercial launch milestones paid to Neurimmune will be reflected in this line. Eisai's reimbursement for these items will be reflected in collaboration profit sharing.  
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for $750 million. As of September 30, 2021, there was $2.8 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 149 million shares for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $4.77. 
In the third quarter, we generated approximately $805 million in cash flow from operations. CapEx was $42 million and free cash flow was approximately $763 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $3.3 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of Q3. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term.  
And let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2021. We are increasing our full year 2021 revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion to a new range of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion, primarily as a result of stronger MS performance. We are increasing our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $17.50 to $19 to a new range of $18.85 to $19.35, primarily driven by the revenue upside I just mentioned. 
We are lowering our capital expenditure guidance from a previous range of $375 million to $425 million to a new range of $250 million to $300 million, primarily as a result of delayed spend on certain projects, including some which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our guidance assumes minimal ADUHELM revenue in 2021. We continue to expect revenue to start ramping in 2022 and beyond, particularly after the NCD decision in April, assuming a positive outcome. We expect continued declines in both TECFIDERA and RITUXAN in the U.S., and that the decreased revenue from these high-margin products will put pressure on our gross margin percentage. Full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. This range is consistent with our previous guidance and includes an approximate $500 million ADUHELM investment. Of this amount, approximately $150 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and is reflected as collaboration profit sharing effective April 1 and not part of SG&A. These ADUHELM investments are slightly less than our previous estimates, and of course, we will continue to actively manage the pace of this spend. This annual SG&A range also assumes a seasonally higher spend in Q4, consistent with previous years. I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our financial performance and are very focused on the ADUHELM launch. We remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash, modest leverage and a business that generates significant free cash flow. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to grow the business over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments."

Biogen continue to demonstrate resilience and strong execution in the third quarter of the year, providing a solid foundation for the company as we make progress on the ADUHELM launch ahead of the important data releases and publications, in addition to the NCD decision for the class of anti-amyloid antibodies anticipated next April.
We believe ADUHELM presents a significant step in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as the first FDA-approved treatment to address a defined pathology of the disease, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. We know there are patients suffering right now from the disease. And it is those patients we keep in mind as we work to support access. In fact, at the CTAD meeting next month, we'll be presenting an analysis showing that without access, every day that passes, we estimate that over 1,000 Americans move from mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia and, therefore, may no longer be appropriate for initiation of treatment with ADUHELM. As many have observed our current system so far falls short in diagnosing and intervening in the disease. 
In addition, Alzheimer's disease is a particularly acute issue of inequality as African Americans are up to 3x more likely and Latinx individuals are 1.5x more likely to have Alzheimer's disease when compared to others. We understand the seriousness of this issue. And that inclusion of underrepresented population in drug development is often low, including in our Alzheimer's clinical trial. We also know that we have work to do and a role to play in correcting this. For that reason, the design of ICARE AD, our real-world Phase IV observational study of ADUHELM, aims to include at least 16% of the trial's expected enrollment from Black, African-American and Latinx patients.
In closing, I would like to thank our employees around the world who have demonstrated their dedication to making a positive impact on patients' life and all of the physicians, caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs. Our ability to deliver medicines to patients could not be realized without their passion and commitment. 
We will now open the call for questions."

This is actually not an exact science. And what we believe and what we are hearing is that the majority of prescribers actually fall into a combination of 2 categories. The first is going to be around the benefit/risk profile, which, of course, you are reading about and the question refers to. And the second is also what we refer to, which is the hesitancy due to the NCD analysis. 
However, there are a meaningful portion of prescribers that are still undecided. So those are some in the headlines. We do have a very large bucket that haven't made a decision one way or another. And this is why we have multiple teams working every single day and working very hard to help educate sites and HCPs in our clinical data and on the reimbursement pathways, which you know are very complex. 
And Michel referenced this also in his opening statements, but we're working with urgency because the cost of doing nothing is also well understood. And Michel mentioned that we estimate that 1,000 patients a day advance in their Alzheimer's journey from mild to moderate AD, and they may no longer be appropriate for ADUHELM.

However, there are 5 potential outcomes. And I think the 3 that people mostly talk about or most interested in are, one, being a no-coverage decision. The second is going to be coverage with evidence, which we call CED. And the other will be coverage with restrictions. And if you look at history and you look in the past over the last past 20 years, there's only been 12 that have gone through this process. One was a noncoverage. One was an off-label for a CED, and the other 10 were basically covered indication. So even though we can't really comment on it, we are in this rigorous process.

In fact, the headwinds that we're facing are the ones Michel has mentioned and that you clearly also read in the press every day, and you probably see when you are reporting with your analyst reports. 
But as with other therapies, if patients think they might face difficulty affording ADUHELM, we do have financial assistance programs that are available that can help these patients. So if reimbursement or affordability are potential concerns, we hope that our programs can provide really a potential pathway for them. Because we do believe that a lack of financial means should not be a barrier for patients to access ADUHELM."

The -- I think that the current standard of care is to use SSRIs or SNRIs. It takes weeks if not more than a month for them to work. And then patients stay on them chronically, often with side effects. And that's not a great situation. And the reason why people stay on them chronically is because they're slow onset of action. 
So having a 2-week treatment course, where you can then take the drug as needed, is a very different way of thinking, and I think would be attractive to many treating physicians. And the fact that it's rapid onset allows people to give the 2-week treatment and wait for the next as-needed treatment. Because they know, they can be reassured that within 3 days of starting, they see efficacy -- they will see efficacy in their patients.

The difference? There are more similarities than differences between aducanumab and lecanemab. Both bind to aggregated forms of Abeta. Both reduce amyloid plaque burden quite substantially. The differences are that there's no titration needed for lecanumab, and the rates of ARIA at the present time do seem to be low. We'll find out in the Phase III study, but they seem to be lower than the rates of ARIA with aducanumab. And it's given every 2 weeks.

We don't have great visibility to patient counts, which is why we don't comment on them publicly, but we did give you -- we can say that the sites are continuing to progress. We're at approximately 120 sites now that have infused at least one patient, which is more than double what it was about 6 weeks ago. And we're going to continue to monitor those metrics, and we'll ramp it as quickly as we can. But because of all the pieces, that does cause a bit of a delay.
And then the other important thing to remember is titration. So to the extent that we get through a successful NCD, there is still patient titration and dosing levels that need to ramp up. And so the revenue ramp is going to be gradual. But the important takeaway is that over the long term, we continue to believe that it's a very meaningful multibillion dollar opportunity."

But we won't say more at this stage about the number of patients, but we'll have the opportunity to come back."

If you're going to look at Slide 10 in your presentation, it does look like lecanemab has at least the same benefit as ADUHELM does. And given this drug will have a full pivotal positive -- that are presumably positive in the third quarter of next year, it's a safer product, and it is indeed the product you're taking into presymptomatic Alzheimer's. I kind of wonder when you talk about ADUHELM being your growth driver longer term, are we really saying it's either ADUHELM or BAN2401? Can you talk a little bit about the comparative dynamics of the 2 products? And could BAN2401 end up being the major Alzheimer's product that Biogen markets in the future years?"

I think underlying your question is the possibility, I think, that you proposed, that you could stop treatment after a certain period of time.

And during that treatment gap, even though the amyloid plaque burden remained low in those in which amyloid plaque had been removed by lecanumab, that during that treatment gap, Abeta 42 to 40 ratio changed slowly over that period, suggesting that there are changes going on biologically related to the amyloid pathway during that gap period. So I think the jury is still out on whether or not chronic treatment is needed. And I think that remains to be studied, and we look forward to providing more data on that."

And I think when you take a step back and you look at the activated sites, which you know were right around 120 or more, and we do have several hundred that are in queue on this journey, right? So we're giving you a number that talks about the activated site, which means one patient has been infused. But it doesn't capture all the sites that are going through these multiple steps.
The operational challenges are still the same. And when you really look at this, I mean being first and being a pioneer in this space has been overwhelming for the system and for these sites. They've never had a drug like this ever for their patients. And writing their protocols, having to go through all the steps of finding where will they do an MRI, where -- how will they do the lumbar puncture and where they do their infusions has been taking them some time. I was talking to a couple of sites just last week, and they've been trying to do this since June. So it's been taking them several months to get up and running. 
But when you think about our original strategy, which was focusing on the sites where the majority of our patient population have already been diagnosed, you do remember that over 900 sites were ready. So we believe that once we, of course, get our additional data out, we share our data and the NCD outcome is finalized, those are going to be the majority of the sites that we will continue to focus on to get them up and running and get patients through the system."
