It certainly feels like a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Mastercard's CEO. I believe the foundation established under Ajay's leadership positions us extremely well for the future. And I'm looking forward to leading Mastercard from here on and, of course, is counting on your continued support. 
Now 2020 presents the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement. 
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we're well positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking. 
Now let's take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady, with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas. While overall, Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. 
In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter. 
Now we're also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders open, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we're working closely with governments to get funds into people's hands quickly and safely. 
Now turning to our business specifically and the 4-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment. See markets go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth. 
Looking at the trends. Volumes continue to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic. 
Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October-November, we saw some improvement in cross order within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited. 
Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel, as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. 
So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. 
Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you. 
Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we've had in debit with Santander and First Direct, we're really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent wins that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build enhanced digital experience for NatWest's customers across multiple payment rails. 
Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postpone brands, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership but will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers' consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows. 
In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers evenness and more secure payments experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that's automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online. 
Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like PayOne and ALDA in the U.S., Hype and Flow in Italy, Trit in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers with our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and, of course, our global network. Now we're also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multisensitive relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Simoncini Bank and prepaid products and enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage a number of card of Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments. 
We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam's Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday; and extended our Walmart and issuer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM Co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer; and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabelas to include small business. 
Let's come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year. 
In both the U.K. and Spain, we're innovating at IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios Points and reward them with exclusive benefits. 
And on a wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers. 
Let's talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 3% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. 
Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a sixfold increase the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter 4 versus a year ago. 
Our recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumer has a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file organizations, particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix; marketplaces like Etsy; and ride-hailing service like Didi, who have just signed on this quarter. 
And we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person, and hence, we're driving secular shift in-store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, [ 10 years ] at the point of checkout. This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic. 
Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment loans to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse. 
Our recent acquisitions in the services space provide a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded the use of Ethoca's dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company, Rapid, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and Transfast via certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like chicos are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through Session. 
So let's turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment grows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect. First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Breath, Mall Harris, Charles Schwab and TD Bank, and we're moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships. 
Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well. 
In the real-time space, we're excited that payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada's economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 P companies, extending our global footprint. 
Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track business payment service, which is now live with real-time payments, and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionality. We've also extended tracks card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities. 
We're also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships, leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with Transfer Goals, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card. 
Now let's take a look into the future. As you've surely heard, there's a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating Central Bank digital currencies. But a country chooses issue its own CBDC but the pilots we've seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to Central Bank through our policy and the solution perspective. We continue to invest in this space to be ready to coinbase with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wire Rex in the U.K. and Uphole in the U.S. enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network. 
This year, we plan on adding digital currency comported directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. We will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive. 
Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance, and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there's certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin."
6477196,701292904,2184135,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity inve",1561,"Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. 
EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with EBIT growth of 15% partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat. 
Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%. 
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Now let's turn to Page 6, where highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes. 
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our Data Analytics, Consulting & Cyber Intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expensive decrease of 3 ppt. 
Turning to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes. We continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically, with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December. While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy. 
When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes. 
In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border. 
Turning now to Page 9. I'd like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year. 
In total, if you look at the gray line,  cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned. Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we quickly received strong growth across discretionary and non discretionary retail categories. 
Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including both with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few. Further, we have [indiscernible] ourselves with the return of travel and travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of service capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate Espoo, and we will deepen penetration of these across our customer base in this portfolio. All fast positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing landscape. 
In terms of the macro environment, we're optimistic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the state of vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further vacation of social distancing measures and improve its consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021. 
Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during the quarter. 
In addition, I will offer you additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower co-brand deals until broader scale and regional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic in March. Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap and so Q1 2020 expedite of [indiscernible]. And finally, we had repeated incentives as the to close revenues to be flat or up slightly due to newen activity, including ecowin mice adjusted cost. 
Now let's turn to operating expenses. Peacefully have our properties in a reserve ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, mainly digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, PV and material solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping spending actions even a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. 
With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, ecity closed near the end of ember, and we continue to expect the transaction with NatWest to close in Q1. Based on this understanding, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about 0.5 a ppt revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt per year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expense growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they do and the subsequent year. After which, we do not. 
The other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues, and it will be [indiscernible] to operating expenses in Q1. On the open expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter in the prevailing interest rates. This excludes Indian losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

And on the Central Bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so there's multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country. 
So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and that we will start to partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure. 
But let's come back to CBBCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I'm happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there's different roles between a central bank and a private sector banks. You don't -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth. 
So a 2-tier approach and our partnership is with both sectors in this case, private sector, to say what utility could be brought? What's the functionality that makes a difference, let's say, when you want to pay with a CEO cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have as links the cryptocurrency trading our network is a very tangible example of what we could do. 
Then you think about other aspects here is that it's generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And you could imagine a world, there's a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government issued CBD and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying the set of rails which we participated, and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector. That's the play. Early stages, but we will support and we today only carry a currency in our network and when this ties way that will carry CBCs in our network."

So let me take the first part of the question, and then Sachin can talk a little bit more about the pipeline and so forth. Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank. If I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We're going to want to cope innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real. 
Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it's an additional capability that's a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe. 
So I would summarize it, Tien-Tsin, as innovation, cert key pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution selling approach brings it all together, cost services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business. So I think that's generally the story. And how that's changing to, let's say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we're growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we're just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this."

We've become more of a partnership discussion than a vendor relationship. And that's been a key enabler as to helping us win. 
And that carries on, whether it's NatWest, Deutsche Bank, who kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust. I mean things are going to keep happening. We're going to renew existing customers. We're going to keep working on new customers. We're going to look to expand portfolios existing customers. So that's very much upper and center in the bucket of what I call control controllables. So there's stuff which is happening in the macro environment, which we don't necessarily control.

One, what's going on globally in the nature of the release of stimulus payments? What the timing of that is and what the timing of associated spend on that stimulus payment. That's kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit. 
So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It's largely driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus deferred in Q3 start weighing in Q4. On the flip side, performed really, really well. It was still in negative but our market improvement because there was the greater taking place and discretionary cuts, which are pretty heavy. 
We follow this and we track pretty closely. And I think that would reasons why you should explain what changes in terms of the mix between debit and credit."

We do have exactly, which is the non-cross-border a little bit of a recovery. There are lots of puts which take place there. And let me try give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right? 
First, at the end of the day, when you talk about this component of north cross-border, there are still orders which are open. There are PE crabs. If you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East. I could think about certain trucks taking place in Asia Pacific, you might be seeing a little bit of that to, which is is driving is. At the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it, generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes traveling. But other those borders will influence by that. People are seeing orations. We have cars, which are from their own countries, and spend patterns on that could be a little bit of what were going on -- what. 
I wouldn't make too much and we're seeing in the first 3 weeks. For a little bit of a longer period of time. And that's again a dollar age. 
On your overtime question on water. Look, I can tell that. Media as a company are very encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still uncertain, and we'll watch how the rollout goes. We believe with the availability of vaccines that we believe is the availability of more efficient therapeutics. 
People the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. So through the sensing measure will start. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So dome, I would tell you, I'm quite optimistic about the we're seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results. 
And it all kind of shakes out and rolling up to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just add how thought about it is the near term, in the longer term. The nearer term will need to be linear until the vaccine stuff is go out at scale. So we feel very important."

Corporate travel, that will take longer on video tools original. We should have actually used the video tool today, maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, people don't exactly know.

What makes the trend? That's like -- that's the key question here. Certainly, we started a digitization trend that's been around for years accelerate dramatically. I think it's fair to say that years have been compressed into months. 
So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we're going to see as structural changes is sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before. 
The surveys that we've done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers, broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now. And we don't think that will change. 70% of consumers, they're going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain. 
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we'll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We'll benefit from both of them. 
Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that's an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective. 
And then there's a whole cross-border, advertising, supply chain, B2B, I would say, the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic."

I missed the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business as behind that. Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is. It's adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning. So it's a wide range of use cases, and we're pretty agnostic what they are. We're quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails, but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation, as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively. 
That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That's check, check, check, and it's a good combination for us. 
Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay to cars, whatever it is, one thing in to Mastercard. That's the overall strategy. 
Finicity helps us clearly in the United States, but as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time, taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter. 
Now Sachin can help to unravel some of these business models behind."

And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails. But the reality is we're in the business of providing choice to consumers. And what we're going to do is provide choice we get price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it's a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over, for example, open bank rails may be, but it's a payment transaction.

But there will also be the mix in Mastercard Send; Transact; Mastercard Track, expanding into B2B; more account-to-account remittances, et cetera, across the board, mixing into the cross-border volumes.

But I want to remind you that the vast majority of our travel on cross-border perspective happens to be personal travel, which we expect to come back and come back based on the comment which Michael made around the pent-up demand. So we'll see that come. 
But you're exactly right about other elements of cross-border, whether it's leveraging our real-time rails and the applications in our cross-border manner, great opportunity. We feel that as well. Because today, what we're tapping into is the consumer flows, what we call the person to merchant flows, leveraging our cards and cross-border environment. The opportunity from a B2C standpoint still remains largely on that. And this is where our speed of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it's our send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast, which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we're rolling those out pretty nicely. We're building scale, we are building capabilities as we go down that path.

I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of the moments that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives. 
The first is our office -- case, these are packers, these are customers. And we have strong relationships with all of them: Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it, and just think about the Apple card as an example there. 
When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there's a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem in these big tech players. But what I'm finding is that our specialist role here and our focused specific payment technology makes us a very relevant partner. 
Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience, their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they're a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of a direction that I think will continue to evolve. 
Some of these players do have payment aspirations. Don, that's where your question is going in. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like carbon files openat on and so forth. We help them with our service portfolio, while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience. 
The X space is a good example for that. And as long as there's choice and underlying payment tools, we're quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of digital trend. 
In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and view on big peak, that's a comment on. Basically, we're guided by our partnership book and continue our business. Overall, otherwise, i.e. we have a great job, the incoming administration. This is in payments which we like. And this is, by the way, a trend of toll. Government is as critical infrastructure and engage in that dialogue with the cybersecurity data pools where we all lead and that's how we engage."

It certainly feels like a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Mastercard's CEO. I believe the foundation established under Ajay's leadership positions us extremely well for the future. And I'm looking forward to leading Mastercard from here on and of course, counting on your continued support.
Now 2020 presents the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement.
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we're well positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking.
Now let's take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas, while overall Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter.
Now we're also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders opened, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we're working closely with governments to get funds into people's hands quickly and safely.
Now turning to our business specifically and the 4-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment. [ C markets ] go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth.
Looking at the trends. Volumes continued to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic.
Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October and November, we saw some improvement in cross-border within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited.
Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs.
So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you.
Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we've had in debit with Santander and first direct, we're really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland.
This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent [ wins ] that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build an enhanced digital experience for NatWest's customers across multiple payment rails.
Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postbank Banks, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership and will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers' consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows.
In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers with a seamless and more secure payment experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that's automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online.
Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like Payoneer and Aeldra in the U.S., HYPE and Flow in Italy, Treezor in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers appreciate our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and of course, our global network.
Now we're also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multifaceted relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Synchrony Bank and prepaid products that enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage [ a number of ] Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments.
We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future of health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam's Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday, and extended our Walmart consumer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer; and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's to include small business.
Let's come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year.
In both the U.K. and Spain, we're innovating with IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios points and reward them with exclusive benefits. And on the wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers.
Let's talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates, with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 40% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a sixfold increase in the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter 4 versus a year ago.
Now recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumers have a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file tokenization is particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix, marketplaces like Etsy and ride hailing services like Didi who have just signed on this quarter.
But we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person, and hence, we're driving a secular shift in store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, [indiscernible] at the point of checkout.
This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic.
Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment flows to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse.
Our recent acquisitions in the services space providing a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded its use of Ethoca's dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company Rappi, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and [ Transfast ] certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like Chico's are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through SessionM.
So let's turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect.
First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Brex, BMO Harris, Charles Schwab and [ ED ] Bank, and we're moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships.
Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well.
In the real-time space, we're excited that Payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada's economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 GDP countries, extending our global footprint.
Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, which is now live with real-time payments and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionalities. We've also extended Track's card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities.
We're also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with TransferGo, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card.
Now let's take a look into the future. As you've surely heard, there's a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating central bank digital currencies. When a country chooses to issue its own CBDC like the pilots we've seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to central banks through our policy and the solution perspective.
We've continued to invest in this space to be ready to [ co-invest ] with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wirex in the U.K. and Uphold in the U.S., enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network.
This year, we plan on adding digital currency [ controlled ] directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. This will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive.
Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there's certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead.
With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin."

Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity inve",1601,"Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments.
Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions.
EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with debt growth of 15%, partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat.
Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%.
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth.
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes.
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our data analytics, consulting and cyber and intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expense decrease of 3 ppt.
Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes, we continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December.
While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy.
When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes.
In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border.
Turning now to Page 9. I'd like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year.
In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned.
Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we effectively received strong growth across discretionary and nondiscretionary retail categories.
Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including those with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few.
Further, we have positioned ourselves with the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate than before, and we will deepen penetration of these services across our customer base while expanding this portfolio. And our multi-rail strategy positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing payments landscape.
In terms of the macro environment, we're enthusiastic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the rate at which vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further relaxation of social distancing measures and improvement in consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021.
Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during this quarter.
In addition, I will offer a few additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower cross-border related deals until broader scale interregional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic primarily in March.
Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap year and so Q1 2020 had an extra day of volumes and revenues. And finally, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be flat or up slightly sequentially due to new deal activity, including some of the recent wins Michael has just discussed.
Now let's turn to operating expenses. We continue to carefully manage our properties in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, namely digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping of spending actions taken a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago.
With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, Finicity closed near the end of last November, and we continue to expect the transaction with Nets to close in Q1. Based on this timing, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about a 0.5 ppt to revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year. After which, we do not split them up.
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q1. On the other income and expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

And on the central bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so here's multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country.
So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and then we will certainly partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure.
But let's come back to CBDCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I'm happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there's different roles between a central bank and a private sector bank. You don't -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth, so a 2-tier approach.
And our partnership is with both sectors in this case. Private sector to say what utility could be brought? What's the functionality that makes a difference, let's say, when you want to pay with a cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have that links the cryptocurrency that's trading on our network is a very tangible example of what we could do.
Then you think about other aspects here is that it's generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And if you could imagine a world where there's a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government-issued CBDC, and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying set of rails which we participate in and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector.
That's the play. Early stages, but we will support. And we today only carry [ CF ] currency in our network. And when this makes its way, then we'll carry CBDCs in our network."

Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank, if I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We're going to want to co-innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real.
Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is -- open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it's an additional capability that's a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe.
So I would summarize it, Tien-Tsin, as innovation. Certainly, pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution [ selling ] approach brings it all together across services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business.
So I think that's generally the story. And how that's changing to, let's say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we're growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we're just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this."

And that's been a key enabler as to helping us win.
And that carries on, whether it's NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the whole kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust.

That's kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit.
So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It's largely been driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus we've referred in Q3 started to weigh in Q4.
On the flip side, credit performed really, really well. And when I say really well, it was still in negative, but a market improvement in credit because there was a [ greater spend ] taking place in discretionary categories, which are credit heavy.
So we follow this and we track this pretty closely. And I think that would be the reasons why you should explain what changes are taking place in terms of the mix between debit and credit."

And then just the second part is more of a conceptual question. I mean in your base case of macro recovery and travel recovery, is it feasible that cross-border revenues next year in 2022 could get back to 2019 level? Not obviously asking for guidance but conceptually based on how you think the macro could theoretically unfold."

I would tell you, we're closely watching what these trends are. In the first 3 weeks, we have exactly what you're saying, which is the non-intra-Europe cross-border  had started to see a little bit of a recovery come through. There are lots of puts and takes which take place there. And let me try and give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right?
First, at the end of the day, when you think about this component of non-intra cross-border, there are still several borders which are open. There are people traveling, if you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East and Africa. I could think about certain travel which is taking place in Asia Pacific. So you might be seeing -- you're seeing a little bit of that come through.
The other component which is driving this is, at the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes and traveling. But other cross-border is also influenced by expats, people who are [ sitting in far ] locations, who have cars, which are -- from their home countries. And the spend patterns on that could be influencing a little bit of what were going on -- what we're seeing here.
I wouldn't make too much of the trend we are seeing in the first 3 weeks. We have to watch it for a little bit of a longer period of time. And that's the kind of color I could share with you on that.
On your longer-term question on cross-border, look, I got to tell you, we as a company are very encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still kind of uncertain, and we'll watch how the rollout goes. We believe -- with the availability of vaccines at scale, we believe of the availability of more efficient testing therapeutics.
People -- the consumer -- the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. And social distancing measures would start to relax. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So [indiscernible] I would tell you, I'm quite optimistic about the fact that we're seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results would suggest.
And we'll see where it all kind of shakes out. I'm really not in a position to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just [ stand back and thought ] about it, the near term and in the longer term, the nearer term will continue to be linear until the vaccine stuff is rolled out at scale. The longer term, we feel very encouraged about."

And that is that there's distinction between personal travel and corporate travel. We've seen it in the summer, this past summer 2020. The reaction, once consumer confidence increases, turned right up into travel increasing because people want to get on with their lives. They want to see their friends, their families and whatever. So the reaction of personal travel, too, driven by consumer confidence, which will in turn be driven by the vaccine rollout Sachin just talked about, I think, was going to be relatively near term.
Corporate travel, that will take longer. Video tools, we should have actually used the video tool today maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, we don't exactly know.
But back to personal travel, that is a significant majority of our travel portfolio. And all the wins that we had recently, they're going to kick at this time. So medium term, we're encouraged."

Certainly, we started a digitization trend that's been around for years, accelerate dramatically. I think it's fair to say that years have been compressed into months.
So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we're going to see as structural changes, as sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before.
The surveys that we've done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers -- broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now, and we don't think that will change. 70% of consumers, they're going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience, as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we'll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We'll benefit from both of them.
Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that's an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective.
And then there's a whole cross-border [indiscernible] digitizing supply chains, B2B. I would say that's the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic."

That's a pretty broad question, Lisa. So let me tick the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business all behind that.
Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is, it's adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning.
So it's a wide range of use cases, and we're pretty agnostic what they are. We're quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively.
That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That's check, check, check, and it's a good combination for us.
Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay through cards, whatever it is, one thing is through Mastercard. That's the overall strategy.
Finicity helps us clearly in the United States. But as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time. Taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter.
Now Sachin can help you unravel some of these business models behind that."

I think you're quite familiar with the way we think about what constitutes our yield as a business, right? It's across infrastructure, applications and services. And I would tell you whether it's our card rails or it's our real-time ACH rails or it's open banking. The reality is there's an opportunity to realize revenue across all of these 3 layers: infrastructure, apps and services.
And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails, well, the reality is we're in the business of providing choice to consumers.
And what we're going to do is provide choice, we're getting price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it's a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over -- for example, open bank rails maybe, but it's a payment transaction.
What I can tell you, though, is take something like Pay by Account, which we've launched in the U.K. The economics for us on Pay by Account in the consumer use case in the U.K. are quite similar to our economics out there."

So we'll see that come through.
But you're exactly right about other elements of cross-border, whether it's leveraging our real-time rails and the applications in our cross-border manner, real opportunity we feel that as well because today, what we're tapping into is the consumer flows, what we call the person-to-merchant flows, leveraging our card rails in a cross-border environment.
The opportunity from a B2B standpoint still remains largely untapped. And this is where our suite of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it's our Send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we're rolling those out pretty nicely. We're building scale, we're building capabilities as we go down that path.
So all in all, I tell you, cross-border remains a selling -- decent sized opportunity on a going-forward basis."

Don, that's a good question to round this call off, I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of elements that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives.
The first is our [ opus ], just want to run you was, these are partners, these are customers, and we have strong relationships with all of them. Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it. And just think about the Apple Card as an example there.
When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails, in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there's a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem and here's big tech players. But what I'm finding is that our specialist role here and our focus specific on payment technology makes us a very relevant partner.
Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience to their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they're a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of interaction that I think will continue to evolve.
Some of these players do have payment aspirations. And Don, that's where your question is going. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like card-on-file tokenization and so forth. We help them with our services portfolio while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience.
The xPays is a good example for that. And as long as there's choice and underlying payment tools, we're quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of the digital trend.
In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and the view on big tech, that is for them to comment on. Basically, we're guided by our partnership. We're going to lean in and continue to drive our business.
Overall, otherwise, it's early days. We have a great dialogue with the incoming administration. They're interested in payments which we generally like. This is, by the way, the trend around the world. Governments interested in payments is critical national infrastructure, and we engage in that dialogue, topics of cybersecurity and data principles where we're all a leading voice and that's how we engage."

Now 2020 presents the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement.
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we're well positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking.
Now let's take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas, while overall Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter.
Now we're also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders opened, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we're working closely with governments to get funds into people's hands quickly and safely.
Now turning to our business specifically and the 4-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment. [ C markets ] go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth.
Looking at the trends. Volumes continued to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic.
Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October and November, we saw some improvement in cross-border within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited.
Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs.
So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you.
Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we've had in debit with Santander and first direct, we're really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland.
This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent [ wins ] that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build an enhanced digital experience for NatWest's customers across multiple payment rails.
Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postbank Banks, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership and will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers' consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows.
In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers with a seamless and more secure payment experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that's automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online.
Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like Payoneer and Aeldra in the U.S., HYPE and Flow in Italy, Treezor in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers appreciate our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and of course, our global network.
Now we're also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multifaceted relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Synchrony Bank and prepaid products that enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage [ a number of ] Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments.
We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future of health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam's Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday, and extended our Walmart consumer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer; and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's to include small business.
Let's come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year.
In both the U.K. and Spain, we're innovating with IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios points and reward them with exclusive benefits. And on the wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers.
Let's talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates, with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 40% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a sixfold increase in the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter 4 versus a year ago.
Now recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumers have a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file tokenization is particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix, marketplaces like Etsy and ride hailing services like Didi who have just signed on this quarter.
But we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person, and hence, we're driving a secular shift in store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, [indiscernible] at the point of checkout.
This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic.
Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment flows to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse.
Our recent acquisitions in the services space providing a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded its use of Ethoca's dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company Rappi, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and [ Transfast ] certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like Chico's are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through SessionM.
So let's turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect.
First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Brex, BMO Harris, Charles Schwab and [ ED ] Bank, and we're moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships.
Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well.
In the real-time space, we're excited that Payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada's economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 GDP countries, extending our global footprint.
Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, which is now live with real-time payments and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionalities. We've also extended Track's card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities.
We're also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with TransferGo, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card.
Now let's take a look into the future. As you've surely heard, there's a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating central bank digital currencies. When a country chooses to issue its own CBDC like the pilots we've seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to central banks through our policy and the solution perspective.
We've continued to invest in this space to be ready to [ co-invest ] with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wirex in the U.K. and Uphold in the U.S., enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network.
This year, we plan on adding digital currency [ controlled ] directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. This will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive.
Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there's certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead.
With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin."
6477196,701292904,2252750,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity inve",1601,"Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments.
Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions.
EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with debt growth of 15%, partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat.
Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%.
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth.
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes.
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our data analytics, consulting and cyber and intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expense decrease of 3 ppt.
Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes, we continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December.
While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy.
When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes.
In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border.
Turning now to Page 9. I'd like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year.
In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned.
Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we effectively received strong growth across discretionary and nondiscretionary retail categories.
Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including those with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few.
Further, we have positioned ourselves with the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate than before, and we will deepen penetration of these services across our customer base while expanding this portfolio. And our multi-rail strategy positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing payments landscape.
In terms of the macro environment, we're enthusiastic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the rate at which vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further relaxation of social distancing measures and improvement in consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021.
Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during this quarter.
In addition, I will offer a few additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower cross-border related deals until broader scale interregional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic primarily in March.
Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap year and so Q1 2020 had an extra day of volumes and revenues. And finally, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be flat or up slightly sequentially due to new deal activity, including some of the recent wins Michael has just discussed.
Now let's turn to operating expenses. We continue to carefully manage our properties in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, namely digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping of spending actions taken a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago.
With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, Finicity closed near the end of last November, and we continue to expect the transaction with Nets to close in Q1. Based on this timing, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about a 0.5 ppt to revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year. After which, we do not split them up.
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q1. On the other income and expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

And on the central bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so here's multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country.
So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and then we will certainly partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure.
But let's come back to CBDCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I'm happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there's different roles between a central bank and a private sector bank. You don't -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth, so a 2-tier approach.
And our partnership is with both sectors in this case. Private sector to say what utility could be brought? What's the functionality that makes a difference, let's say, when you want to pay with a cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have that links the cryptocurrency that's trading on our network is a very tangible example of what we could do.
Then you think about other aspects here is that it's generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And if you could imagine a world where there's a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government-issued CBDC, and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying set of rails which we participate in and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector.
That's the play. Early stages, but we will support. And we today only carry [ CF ] currency in our network. And when this makes its way, then we'll carry CBDCs in our network."

Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank, if I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We're going to want to co-innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real.
Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is -- open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it's an additional capability that's a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe.
So I would summarize it, Tien-Tsin, as innovation. Certainly, pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution [ selling ] approach brings it all together across services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business.
So I think that's generally the story. And how that's changing to, let's say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we're growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we're just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this."

And that's been a key enabler as to helping us win.
And that carries on, whether it's NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the whole kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust. I mean things are going to keep happening. We're going to renew existing customers. We're going to keep working on new customers. We're going to look to expand portfolios with existing customers.

One, what's going on globally in the nature of the release of stimulus payments? What the timing of that is and what's the timing of associated spend on that stimulus payment. That's kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit.
So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It's largely been driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus we've referred in Q3 started to weigh in Q4.
On the flip side, credit performed really, really well. And when I say really well, it was still in negative, but a market improvement in credit because there was a [ greater spend ] taking place in discretionary categories, which are credit heavy.
So we follow this and we track this pretty closely. And I think that would be the reasons why you should explain what changes are taking place in terms of the mix between debit and credit."

I would tell you, we're closely watching what these trends are. In the first 3 weeks, we have exactly what you're saying, which is the non-intra-Europe cross-border  had started to see a little bit of a recovery come through. There are lots of puts and takes which take place there. And let me try and give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right?
First, at the end of the day, when you think about this component of non-intra cross-border, there are still several borders which are open. There are people traveling, if you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East and Africa. I could think about certain travel which is taking place in Asia Pacific. So you might be seeing -- you're seeing a little bit of that come through.
The other component which is driving this is, at the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes and traveling. But other cross-border is also influenced by expats, people who are [ sitting in far ] locations, who have cars, which are -- from their home countries. And the spend patterns on that could be influencing a little bit of what were going on -- what we're seeing here.
I wouldn't make too much of the trend we are seeing in the first 3 weeks. We have to watch it for a little bit of a longer period of time. And that's the kind of color I could share with you on that.
On your longer-term question on cross-border, look, I got to tell you, we as a company are very encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still kind of uncertain, and we'll watch how the rollout goes. We believe -- with the availability of vaccines at scale, we believe of the availability of more efficient testing therapeutics.
People -- the consumer -- the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. And social distancing measures would start to relax. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So [indiscernible] I would tell you, I'm quite optimistic about the fact that we're seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results would suggest.
And we'll see where it all kind of shakes out. I'm really not in a position to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just [ stand back and thought ] about it, the near term and in the longer term, the nearer term will continue to be linear until the vaccine stuff is rolled out at scale. The longer term, we feel very encouraged about."

And that is that there's distinction between personal travel and corporate travel. We've seen it in the summer, this past summer 2020. The reaction, once consumer confidence increases, turned right up into travel increasing because people want to get on with their lives. They want to see their friends, their families and whatever. So the reaction of personal travel, too, driven by consumer confidence, which will in turn be driven by the vaccine rollout Sachin just talked about, I think, was going to be relatively near term.
Corporate travel, that will take longer. Video tools, we should have actually used the video tool today maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, we don't exactly know.
But back to personal travel, that is a significant majority of our travel portfolio. And all the wins that we had recently, they're going to kick at this time. So medium term, we're encouraged."

Certainly, we started a digitization trend that's been around for years, accelerate dramatically. I think it's fair to say that years have been compressed into months.
So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we're going to see as structural changes, as sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before.
The surveys that we've done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers -- broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now, and we don't think that will change. 70% of consumers, they're going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience, as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we'll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We'll benefit from both of them.
Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that's an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective.
And then there's a whole cross-border [indiscernible] digitizing supply chains, B2B. I would say that's the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic."

That's a pretty broad question, Lisa. So let me tick the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business all behind that.
Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is, it's adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning.
So it's a wide range of use cases, and we're pretty agnostic what they are. We're quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively.
That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That's check, check, check, and it's a good combination for us.
Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay through cards, whatever it is, one thing is through Mastercard. That's the overall strategy.
Finicity helps us clearly in the United States. But as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time. Taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter.
Now Sachin can help you unravel some of these business models behind that."

I think you're quite familiar with the way we think about what constitutes our yield as a business, right? It's across infrastructure, applications and services. And I would tell you whether it's our card rails or it's our real-time ACH rails or it's open banking. The reality is there's an opportunity to realize revenue across all of these 3 layers: infrastructure, apps and services.
And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails, well, the reality is we're in the business of providing choice to consumers.
And what we're going to do is provide choice, we're getting price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it's a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over -- for example, open bank rails maybe, but it's a payment transaction.
What I can tell you, though, is take something like Pay by Account, which we've launched in the U.K. The economics for us on Pay by Account in the consumer use case in the U.K. are quite similar to our economics out there."

One, we do expect, with the return of travel, the mix will start to come back to a certain level similar to what we saw pre-COVID. It might take a little of time as it relates to the business travel component. But I want to remind you that the vast majority of our travel from a cross-border perspective happens to be personal travel, which we expect to come back and come back based on the comment which Michael made around the pent-up demand. So we'll see that come through.
But you're exactly right about other elements of cross-border, whether it's leveraging our real-time rails and the applications in our cross-border manner, real opportunity we feel that as well because today, what we're tapping into is the consumer flows, what we call the person-to-merchant flows, leveraging our card rails in a cross-border environment.
The opportunity from a B2B standpoint still remains largely untapped. And this is where our suite of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it's our Send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we're rolling those out pretty nicely. We're building scale, we're building capabilities as we go down that path.
So all in all, I tell you, cross-border remains a selling -- decent sized opportunity on a going-forward basis."

A big part of the supply chain insight that people have just gained over the last 9 months is that there's dependency on parts of the supply chain cross-border that they want to digitize and this -- so they can be more flexible to change suppliers in future scenarios.
Now here, we come in with Transfast. We come in with our announced acquisition of HomeSend, the combination of all of that. And then you take this multi-rail capabilities, picture this in the context of Track, where there's a data switch, all the data that you want alongside with your B2B transaction is coming along and you choose whichever way you want to send it.

Don, that's a good question to round this call off, I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of elements that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives.
The first is our [ opus ], just want to run you was, these are partners, these are customers, and we have strong relationships with all of them. Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it. And just think about the Apple Card as an example there.
When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails, in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there's a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem and here's big tech players. But what I'm finding is that our specialist role here and our focus specific on payment technology makes us a very relevant partner.
Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience to their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they're a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of interaction that I think will continue to evolve.
Some of these players do have payment aspirations. And Don, that's where your question is going. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like card-on-file tokenization and so forth. We help them with our services portfolio while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience.
The xPays is a good example for that. And as long as there's choice and underlying payment tools, we're quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of the digital trend.
In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and the view on big tech, that is for them to comment on. Basically, we're guided by our partnership. We're going to lean in and continue to drive our business.
Overall, otherwise, it's early days. We have a great dialogue with the incoming administration. They're interested in payments which we generally like. This is, by the way, the trend around the world. Governments interested in payments is critical national infrastructure, and we engage in that dialogue, topics of cybersecurity and data principles where we're all a leading voice and that's how we engage."

Now we said on a number of occasions throughout this call here, we're optimistic about COVID recovery, really in the light of the vaccine being deployed. We're optimistic about cross-border coming back driven by the exact same point. So in the near term, there's optimism. In the very, very long term, there is optimism.
I want to make one more point. All of this is great from an economic perspective and a performance perspective.

It certainly feels like a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Mastercard's CEO. I believe the foundation established under Ajay's leadership positions us extremely well for the future. And I'm looking forward to leading Mastercard from here on and of course, counting on your continued support.
Now 2020 presents the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement.
As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we're well positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking.
Now let's take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas, while overall Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter.
Now we're also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders opened, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we're working closely with governments to get funds into people's hands quickly and safely.
Now turning to our business specifically and the 4-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment. [ C markets ] go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth.
Looking at the trends. Volumes continued to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic.
Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October and November, we saw some improvement in cross-border within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited.
Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs.
So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you.
Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we've had in debit with Santander and first direct, we're really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland.
This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent [ wins ] that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build an enhanced digital experience for NatWest's customers across multiple payment rails.
Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postbank Banks, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership and will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers' consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows.
In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers with a seamless and more secure payment experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that's automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online.
Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like Payoneer and Aeldra in the U.S., HYPE and Flow in Italy, Treezor in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers appreciate our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and of course, our global network.
Now we're also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multifaceted relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Synchrony Bank and prepaid products that enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage [ a number of ] Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments.
We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future of health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam's Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday, and extended our Walmart consumer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer; and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's to include small business.
Let's come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year.
In both the U.K. and Spain, we're innovating with IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios points and reward them with exclusive benefits. And on the wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers.
Let's talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates, with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 40% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a sixfold increase in the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter 4 versus a year ago.
Now recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumers have a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file tokenization is particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix, marketplaces like Etsy and ride hailing services like Didi who have just signed on this quarter.
But we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person, and hence, we're driving a secular shift in store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, [indiscernible] at the point of checkout.
This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic.
Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment flows to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse.
Our recent acquisitions in the services space providing a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded its use of Ethoca's dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company Rappi, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and [ Transfast ] certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like Chico's are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through SessionM.
So let's turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect.
First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Brex, BMO Harris, Charles Schwab and [ ED ] Bank, and we're moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships.
Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well.
In the real-time space, we're excited that Payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada's economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 GDP countries, extending our global footprint.
Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, which is now live with real-time payments and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionalities. We've also extended Track's card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities.
We're also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with TransferGo, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card.
Now let's take a look into the future. As you've surely heard, there's a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating central bank digital currencies. When a country chooses to issue its own CBDC like the pilots we've seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to central banks through our policy and the solution perspective.
We've continued to invest in this space to be ready to [ co-invest ] with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wirex in the U.K. and Uphold in the U.S., enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network.
This year, we plan on adding digital currency [ controlled ] directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. This will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive.
Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there's certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead.
With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin."

Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments.
Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions.
EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with debt growth of 15%, partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat.
Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%.
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth.
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes.
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our data analytics, consulting and cyber and intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expense decrease of 3 ppt.
Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes, we continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December.
While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy.
When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes.
In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border.
Turning now to Page 9. I'd like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year.
In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned.
Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we effectively received strong growth across discretionary and nondiscretionary retail categories.
Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including those with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few.
Further, we have positioned ourselves with the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate than before, and we will deepen penetration of these services across our customer base while expanding this portfolio. And our multi-rail strategy positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing payments landscape.
In terms of the macro environment, we're enthusiastic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the rate at which vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further relaxation of social distancing measures and improvement in consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021.
Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during this quarter.
In addition, I will offer a few additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower cross-border related deals until broader scale interregional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic primarily in March.
Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap year and so Q1 2020 had an extra day of volumes and revenues. And finally, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be flat or up slightly sequentially due to new deal activity, including some of the recent wins Michael has just discussed.
Now let's turn to operating expenses. We continue to carefully manage our properties in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, namely digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping of spending actions taken a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago.
With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, Finicity closed near the end of last November, and we continue to expect the transaction with Nets to close in Q1. Based on this timing, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about a 0.5 ppt to revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year. After which, we do not split them up.
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q1. On the other income and expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

And on the central bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so here's multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country.
So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and then we will certainly partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure.
But let's come back to CBDCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I'm happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there's different roles between a central bank and a private sector bank. You don't -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth, so a 2-tier approach.
And our partnership is with both sectors in this case. Private sector to say what utility could be brought? What's the functionality that makes a difference, let's say, when you want to pay with a cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have that links the cryptocurrency that's trading on our network is a very tangible example of what we could do.
Then you think about other aspects here is that it's generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And if you could imagine a world where there's a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government-issued CBDC, and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying set of rails which we participate in and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector.
That's the play. Early stages, but we will support. And we today only carry [ CF ] currency in our network. And when this makes its way, then we'll carry CBDCs in our network."

Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank, if I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We're going to want to co-innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real.
Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is -- open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it's an additional capability that's a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe.
So I would summarize it, Tien-Tsin, as innovation. Certainly, pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution [ selling ] approach brings it all together across services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business.
So I think that's generally the story. And how that's changing to, let's say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we're growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we're just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this."

And that carries on, whether it's NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the whole kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust.

That's kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit.
So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It's largely been driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus we've referred in Q3 started to weigh in Q4.
On the flip side, credit performed really, really well. And when I say really well, it was still in negative, but a market improvement in credit because there was a [ greater spend ] taking place in discretionary categories, which are credit heavy.
So we follow this and we track this pretty closely. And I think that would be the reasons why you should explain what changes are taking place in terms of the mix between debit and credit."

But can you just touch on what has maybe driven the incremental improvement in that metric and the sustainability of the improvement as the comps presumably get progressively easier from here, more or less on a weekly basis?
And then just the second part is more of a conceptual question.

I would tell you, we're closely watching what these trends are. In the first 3 weeks, we have exactly what you're saying, which is the non-intra-Europe cross-border  had started to see a little bit of a recovery come through. There are lots of puts and takes which take place there. And let me try and give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right?
First, at the end of the day, when you think about this component of non-intra cross-border, there are still several borders which are open. There are people traveling, if you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East and Africa. I could think about certain travel which is taking place in Asia Pacific. So you might be seeing -- you're seeing a little bit of that come through.
The other component which is driving this is, at the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes and traveling. But other cross-border is also influenced by expats, people who are [ sitting in far ] locations, who have cars, which are -- from their home countries. And the spend patterns on that could be influencing a little bit of what were going on -- what we're seeing here.
I wouldn't make too much of the trend we are seeing in the first 3 weeks. We have to watch it for a little bit of a longer period of time. And that's the kind of color I could share with you on that.
On your longer-term question on cross-border, look, I got to tell you, we as a company are very encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still kind of uncertain, and we'll watch how the rollout goes. We believe -- with the availability of vaccines at scale, we believe of the availability of more efficient testing therapeutics.
People -- the consumer -- the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. And social distancing measures would start to relax. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So [indiscernible] I would tell you, I'm quite optimistic about the fact that we're seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results would suggest.
And we'll see where it all kind of shakes out. I'm really not in a position to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just [ stand back and thought ] about it, the near term and in the longer term, the nearer term will continue to be linear until the vaccine stuff is rolled out at scale. The longer term, we feel very encouraged about."

And that is that there's distinction between personal travel and corporate travel. We've seen it in the summer, this past summer 2020. The reaction, once consumer confidence increases, turned right up into travel increasing because people want to get on with their lives. They want to see their friends, their families and whatever. So the reaction of personal travel, too, driven by consumer confidence, which will in turn be driven by the vaccine rollout Sachin just talked about, I think, was going to be relatively near term.
Corporate travel, that will take longer. Video tools, we should have actually used the video tool today maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, we don't exactly know.
But back to personal travel, that is a significant majority of our travel portfolio. And all the wins that we had recently, they're going to kick at this time. So medium term, we're encouraged."

Certainly, we started a digitization trend that's been around for years, accelerate dramatically. I think it's fair to say that years have been compressed into months.
So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we're going to see as structural changes, as sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before.
The surveys that we've done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers -- broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now, and we don't think that will change. 70% of consumers, they're going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience, as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we'll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We'll benefit from both of them.
Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that's an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective.
And then there's a whole cross-border [indiscernible] digitizing supply chains, B2B. I would say that's the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic."

That's a pretty broad question, Lisa. So let me tick the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business all behind that.
Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is, it's adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning.
So it's a wide range of use cases, and we're pretty agnostic what they are. We're quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively.
That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That's check, check, check, and it's a good combination for us.
Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay through cards, whatever it is, one thing is through Mastercard. That's the overall strategy.
Finicity helps us clearly in the United States. But as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time. Taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter.
Now Sachin can help you unravel some of these business models behind that."

I think you're quite familiar with the way we think about what constitutes our yield as a business, right? It's across infrastructure, applications and services. And I would tell you whether it's our card rails or it's our real-time ACH rails or it's open banking. The reality is there's an opportunity to realize revenue across all of these 3 layers: infrastructure, apps and services.
And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails, well, the reality is we're in the business of providing choice to consumers.
And what we're going to do is provide choice, we're getting price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it's a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over -- for example, open bank rails maybe, but it's a payment transaction.
What I can tell you, though, is take something like Pay by Account, which we've launched in the U.K. The economics for us on Pay by Account in the consumer use case in the U.K. are quite similar to our economics out there."

The opportunity from a B2B standpoint still remains largely untapped. And this is where our suite of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it's our Send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we're rolling those out pretty nicely. We're building scale, we're building capabilities as we go down that path.

Don, that's a good question to round this call off, I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of elements that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives.
The first is our [ opus ], just want to run you was, these are partners, these are customers, and we have strong relationships with all of them. Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it. And just think about the Apple Card as an example there.
When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails, in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there's a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem and here's big tech players. But what I'm finding is that our specialist role here and our focus specific on payment technology makes us a very relevant partner.
Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience to their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they're a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of interaction that I think will continue to evolve.
Some of these players do have payment aspirations. And Don, that's where your question is going. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like card-on-file tokenization and so forth. We help them with our services portfolio while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience.
The xPays is a good example for that. And as long as there's choice and underlying payment tools, we're quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of the digital trend.
In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and the view on big tech, that is for them to comment on. Basically, we're guided by our partnership. We're going to lean in and continue to drive our business.
Overall, otherwise, it's early days. We have a great dialogue with the incoming administration. They're interested in payments which we generally like. This is, by the way, the trend around the world. Governments interested in payments is critical national infrastructure, and we engage in that dialogue, topics of cybersecurity and data principles where we're all a leading voice and that's how we engage."

So here are the headlines. We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre pandemic trends. We co",1911,"Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are the headlines. We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre pandemic trends. We continue to execute against our strategic objectives as we signed notable new deals, advanced our multirail strategy by closing our transaction with Nets and extended our digital identity capabilities with the planned acquisition of [indiscernible]. 
So let's dive it, looking at the broader economy first. Domestic spending levels showed continued improvement with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our quarter 1 spending pulse report, which is based on all tender types, U.S. retail sales were up 11.8% versus a year ago ex auto, ex gas. This reflects the impact of fiscal stimulus and the lapping of the start of the pandemic. 
Spending costs also indicated that overall European retail sales at close to flat in quarter 1 versus a year ago. The vaccine rollout has become scale in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries. And broadening this critical effort is underway, but will take time. 
Let's start with our business, specifically. At the 4 Phrases framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. At this time last year, markets were going through the containment and stabilization phases. We now believe many markets are transitioning from the normalization phase to the growth phase domestically. Cross-border travel spending continues to be in the stabilization phase where spending is restricted due to closed borders. 
Looking at Mastercard spending trends, volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across products. We saw particular strength in debit, primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and share gains. In terms of how people are spending, e-commerce continues to be strong and we're seeing improvements in card-present spending. 
On the travel front, we've seen some recent improvement in domestic travel, primarily personal travel. Cross-border travel remains limited as border restrictions remain in place for most markets. Cross-border card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to hold up well. 
As we have observed in many markets, progress is not always linear. And we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel, as we've just seen in domestic travel. We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs. 
International travel should start to open on a select basis in the second half of the year between countries, the strong vaccination programs and/or low case rates. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, engaging travelers early through our loyalty programs and expanding relationships with our partners in travel. As a result, we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. 
As we look forward and see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, we will increase the investment we put toward our strategic priorities: one, for payments; two, deploying a broader set of services; three, enabling digital solutions and four, providing choice with multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long term, along with expense discipline. 
Let me illustrate how we're executing against each of these strategic priorities. I will begin by sharing how we're driving growth in the core, always supported by differentiated services capabilities. Here are a few key examples. Building on our strength in U.S. retail co-brands, we're excited that Mastercard has chosen as the exclusive network for gapping, co-branded credit cards across the old Navy, gap, Banana Republic and Asefa brands. This partnership will include a reimagined rewards program to drive increased customer engagement with the migration of existing card members planned for 2022. 
It has a long-term services relationship with GAAP, which led to additional opportunities to support both their co-brand programs and their broader business. We're also leveraging our differentiated service to expand relationships with key global partners like Santander. This quarter, we signed a new deal with Santander Brazil and executed a long-term exclusive partnership with Superdigital's, Santanders fintech arm, to provide digital prepaid accounts across 7 Latin American markets. 
Also, we're happy to announce that the financial arm of one of the largest retailers in Europe, [indiscernible] is migrating its entire closed-loop consumer credit portfolio to Mastercard exclusively for 10 years. This strategic partnership includes our processing capabilities and will contribute to growing Mastercard's overall credit share in the region. 
Talking about share. I'd also like to point out that the migration of Santander U.K. debit portfolio is progressing well, and we're preparing for the other conversions to be previously announced. Finally, we secured several strategic renewals and expansions. As many of you know, Huntington Bank announced its anticipated acquisition of TCF at the end of last year, which will make them a top 10 U.S. regional Bank. I'm happy that they have decided to both renew their existing business with us and convert the TCF business to Mastercard. 
This brings significant new debit volume to our brands. We've also expanded our relationship with Synchrony Bank, as the exclusive partner for their general purpose consumer credit portfolio. 
Turning to the next strategic priority. We continue to enable digital solutions to drive the secular shift to electronic payments. A great example of this can be seen through the partnerships we have established with several leading mobile telecom providers across Africa and other regions. 
In Africa, there are more mobile money accounts and bank accounts and consumers increasingly expect digital financial services to be provided through their mobile phones. Now we signed a multiyear partnership with the MTN group to enable millions of their MTN mobile money wallet customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution. 
We've also expanded our partnership with the Airtel Group to equip their Airtel money customers with virtual cards and QR solutions. And we've extended our partnership with the Airtel Payments Bank in India along with the recent investment in Airtel Mobile Commerce. 
While our digital capabilities are enabling us to penetrate new geographies, our multi-rail strategy is allowing us to provide greater choice and capture new payment flows. We're happy that we have now completed the acquisition of the majority of the Corporate Services division of Nets, which reinforces our leadership position in providing real-time payments, infrastructure and applications. This transaction significantly enhances our application capabilities, inclusive of a robust set of bill payment solutions, which are operating at scale across several markets. 
Furthermore, this is an integral component of our regional strategy in Europe, enabling us to operate as a local partner. We see significant opportunity to expand these capabilities into additional markets around the world. Speaking of Bill Pay in the U.S., we continue to scale our BIP exchange solution through new billers and bank partners. We're excited to announce that Verizon will connect with the most recent national Disa on the platform. 
Turning to cross-border applications. We have now fully integrated our acquisition of Transfast and can now provide unsurpassed reach via a single point of access that allows banks and digital partners to send and receive money through bank accounts, mobile wallets, costs, and cash payouts to over 90% of the world's population in more than 100 countries. We're expanding our relationships with the United Nations Federal Credit Union, the Saudi Bede Bank to expand their reach into additional markets. And both Bancorp and IDT payment services will now leverage our capabilities for cross-border evinces. 
And in addition, we have extended our partnership with Western Union, who will be using our capabilities to allow customers in 18 European countries to transfer funds directly to debit cards in near real time. 
Our multi-rail capabilities are critically important to our efforts in open banking as well. They enable us to provide our customers across banks and fintechs with greater flexibility in how they manage both payment and data flows. We're off to a strong start as in Icity as we've integrated our sales teams and already signed several new connectivity partners and application users. 
For example, go live with our state-of-the-art API-based data access in several large banks, including U.S. bank, as well as with the leading payroll processor, representing millions of employees. 
Finicity was also selected by companies like Upgrade, SWBC, Mcafee, Moneylion and Tomo credit to provide permission-based access to financial data to support a variety of use cases, including mortgage, lending and, of course, payments. We're expanding our open banking capabilities in Europe as well as we now live with our open Banking Connect solution with Lloyds Bank in the U.K. for consumers to make payments to their credit cards. 
We continue to see a great deal of interest and activity in digital currencies, and we're innovating in this space through new crypto and CBDC partnerships, enabling digital currencies on our network, and continuing our investments and underlying blockchain technology as part of our multi-rail strategy. 
We have several new crypto partnerships approved for launch this quarter, including a partnership with Gemini, a leading crypto platform here in the U.S. to launch a first of its kind cryptocurrency rewards credit card that allows consumers to receive crypto rewards on everyday purchases. 
And over in Spain, crypton, a crypto exchange launching a Mastercard cryptocard. On Central Bank digital currencies, we continue to engage with central banks around the world. And our virtual testing platform, it's helping them design features, similar issuance and evaluate interoperability with existing payment systems. In partnership with the Central Bank of Bahamas and Island Pay, we launched the world's first CBDC linked payment card, enabling people to pay for goods and services using fiat currency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. 
Digital identity. Digital identity is critically important as the shift to a digital economy continues. It is a foundational component of our multilayered approach to security and have allowed us to help consumers and businesses safely and easily prove their identity while enabling them to main control over their information. 
Last week, we announced the planned acquisition, [indiscernible], which advances the digital identity efforts we have underway. I content has access to validated identity information on a global basis and leverages artificial intelligence to produce highly accurate identity stores. [indiscernible] insights support multiple payment and nonpayment use cases, including new account openings, instant issuance and transaction risk checks to use by a broad range of customers, including leading digital merchants, financial institutions, travel companies and digital currency platforms. This is an example of how we are entering into adjacent areas and innovating beyond the core payment transaction. 
And now back to the bigger picture. We're leveraging our business to have a broader impact on society by executing our commitment to bring 1 billion people into the digital economy by 2025. Specifically on the environmental front, we have pledged to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050 and issued a sustainability bond in the last quarter to support these efforts. 
Furthermore, our Mastercard carbon calculator developed in collaboration economy, is enabled on our network to provide consumers to the snapshot of carbon emissions generated by their purchases. And we've worked with customers to issue over 10 million cards using sustainable materials. If we tie all of this together, we are now linking executive comp to Mastercard's sustainability priorities. 
With all of that in mind, I continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead, and I'm happy with the progress we're making against our objectives. And with that, Sachin, over to you."

So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net r",1485,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everybody. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 2%, returning to positive growth for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in Q2 2020 and includes a 1 PPT benefit from acquisitions. 
Operating expenses increased 7%, which includes a full ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was down 1%, and net income was down 6%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 5% year-over-year to $1.74, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $418 million through April 26, 2021. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing sequential improvement in both debit and credit as vaccination progress takes hold and mobility increases. 
In addition, debit growth is being further strengthened by fiscal stimulus and share gains. U.S. GDV increased by 14% with debit growth of 26% and a decline in credit of 1%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 5% with debit growth of 12% and a decline in credit of 2%. 
Cross-border volume was down 17% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes down 11% and other cross-border volumes down 23%. 
Turning to Page 5. Switch transactions grew 9% in the first quarter globally. Card-not-present growth rates have accelerated during the past year and continue at those elevated levels. While card-present transactions are now growing above 2019 levels for the first time since the peak of the pandemic. 
In addition, card growth was 6%. And we bally, there are $2.8 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cost issue. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 2% was primarily driven by domestic transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by lower cross-border volume fees and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 8%, in line with worldwide GDV growth of 8%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 26%, while cross-border volumes decreased 17%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross border volumes. 
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switch transactions were up 9%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily driven by adverse mix. Other revenues were up 27%, including a 3 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and data and services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 4%. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 7%. This includes a OPBG increase from acquisitions and a 3 ppt increase related to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. Excluding these items, expenses were flat as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities while keeping an eye on top line growth. 
Turning now to [indiscernible] Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of April. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, primarily due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began mostly in March of last year. Hence, to provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at the spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switch volumes, they have shown steady sequential improvement, continuing along the same trend line we saw in Q1. This is driven primarily by the U.S., which has benefited from the recent fiscal sementes. We have seen improvements in discretionary categories like clothing, furniture and sporting goods. And we have also seen some recent strength in personal domestic travel in the U.S. and the U.K., which we are making strong progress in vaccinations. 
For instance, we have seen U.S. airline spend essentially doubled over the last 4 weeks relative to where it was earlier in Q1. Trends in switch transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switch volumes. 
In terms of cross border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 remained mostly unchanged through the start of April. We continue to see very strong growth in card-not-present cross-border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend. However, border restrictions remain widespread and to cross-border travel, which is card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes continues to be impacted. 
As you can see from the numbers, there is a significant opportunity for improvement in cross-border travel. In fact, where borders are open, such as Mexico, certain Latin American countries and the UAE, we have seen problem improve. 
Turning to Page 9. I want to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and feel we are very well positioned to grow with the new and renew deals we have signed over the last several quarters. 
We have positioned ourselves for the return of travel with travel oriented portfolios and have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a healthy rate and has helped diversify our revenue base. In terms of the macro environment, domestic spending levels have continued to improve, entering the growth phase this quarter, supported in part by fiscal stimulus and the rollout of effective vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has been uneven, however. And as a result, we expect the pace of recovery to vary from country to country. 
As Michael said, we do believe there is significant pent of demand for travel and are already seeing domestic travel improve. In terms of cross border, we believe that in the second half of the year, we will see additional borders open, particularly between those countries with low infection rates and/or advanced vaccination programs. 
Turning to the second quarter. Spending levels continue on their current trajectory, we would expect Q2 net revenues to grow around a low to mid 20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. 
It is important to point out that this is just one potential scenario, which could be impacted by factors such as more restrictive measures being put in place because of rising infections for the opening or closing of borders terms of operating expenses, we continue our disciplined expense management approach while furthering our strategic imperatives and keeping an eye on top line growth as we progress through the growth phase of the pandemic domestically, we will look to increase our investments in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our multi Real solutions as well as begin to increase our advertising and marketing-related spend. 
For Q2, we expect operating expenses to grow at a rate in the low 20s versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are now beginning to lap the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic hit. 
With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have announced the planned acquisition of ICASA and have now closed on the transaction with Nets. And expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q2 and for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in the second quarter and 8 to 9 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year, after which time, we do not split them out. 
Other items to keep in mind, foreign exchange. Is expected to be a 2 to 3 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 3 to 4 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q2. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rate environment. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

So that's pretty clear. So identify is 1 pillar in our overall security strategy. So we needed to strengthen our here. The -- we started that activity with a pilot that we launched in Australia about a year ago that is now going live in partnership with the Australian telecom, Optos, where we are introducing a reusable digital identity. What it contacts us is it accelerates our efforts and accelerates our efforts because Ikata has access to verifiable data data points that allow to establish an identity. As I said earlier, they can, in near real time, produce very accurate identity scores. And it comes along with a set of established set of global customers, digital merchants, cryptocurrency, chains, financial institutions and so forth. So we were on the track. Acada is accelerating our efforts. It sits right into our existing set of cyber solutions because it's the start of the transaction. It's at the end of the transacthion, in between, we have our decision intelligence, our various other transaction focused solution. So it's the full package. It sets us apart.

I know that on an organic constant currency basis, the second quarter OpEx is growing about in line with net revenue. So is that kind of the right general model to think about in the second half as well if the recovery progresses in line with your base case? Or does the second quarter have more catch up OpEx spend in it?"

Look, I mean, rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially as domestic spending recovers and new and renewed deals come online. I think you're aware about the fact that our domestic volumes are more indexed -- revance tires are more indexed domestic volumes. There are less indexed to cross-border. So depending on how that volume mix plays out, things might move around. But generally speaking, we expect rebate incentives as a percentage of growth to be up from current levels, pretty much the remainder of the year as volumes recover. 
On your second question around Opex, look, as we look forward, we see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, and we will increase the investment we put forward towards our strategic priorities. And these are essentially the ones we've talked about growing our share of core payments, ensuring that they do experience for our customers, driving a broader set of services capabilities, executing on our material strategy as well as our BTWOB strategy. As we do this, we will keep an eye on both the top line as well as the bottom line. And we will basically be very focused on making sure that we are making investments to drive the long-term growth of our business. And that's kind of the essential thing I'd like to leave you with, which is we will continue to stay this split from  an expense management standpoint. We see domestic spending is transitioning towards the growth phase, which gives us confidence and vaccines are effective and they're being deployed at scale. So we will keep an eye on all of those metrics, we will keep an eye on the top line, and we will look to invest in the business to drive that long-term growth objective, which we're talking about."

We have, over the last 14 months, on a monthly basis, helps consumers around the world, small businesses around the world. And the input that we're getting from this research remains unchanged. That is fundamentally starting with increasing consumer confidence, spending is going up. And then when you look at the way how people spend, what we're hearing is when the pandemic subsides, 70% of people are saying, I'm going to continue to use more online commerce than I have before the pandemic. Almost 70% of us saying it's the same thing for digital -- for digital banking. Almost the same number says more for contactless. And then you look at the other side of the coin, and that is about 60% of people are saying, I will actually use less cash. So we believe that these trends of elevated anything elevated online will prevail, maybe not at the same levels, but they will be elevated. At the same time, we're already seeing that in countries where strong vaccination programs are there and social distancing measures are reduced. That the spend in-store is coming back. So people do want to go and spend at the local restaurant or support the local shop in their local main street. So the good thing is we're ready for both with our solutions. So that is around consumer behavior, the changing consumer as we turn out of this nightmare. And then you look at what else is going on? And what else are we seeing is with this push towards a more digital economy, we're seeing there's more data around. And the first for data analytics is increasing. Our services teams can't be running fast enough to satisfy that first. If you look at more data, you look at an increasing cyber footprint. So our cyber solutions, that is going to be it's going to be a continuing trend. Earlier, we talked a little bit about our multi-rail strategy and what we're doing there. I talked about Europe and being a local partner, government is interested in teeters government is interested in real-time payments and crypto Central Bank digital currency. So this whole trend of government leaning in I think is important. So our focus on the government vertical is going to help us there. And finally, just came across the news over the last couple of days is the dependence on international supply chains is showing up. It shows up in the context of vaccine distribution at, but it has been showing up across many different industries. So there is a real push to digitize supply chains, make them more flexible. And of course, that comes to payments as well and comes to associated data flows. So B2B should also be seeing quite a push out of -- as we turn out I so it's a shifting picture. And Darrin, I agree with you that there's a lot of things to feel positive about in terms of our strategy is on point for all these drivers. That's why we're increasing the investment behind these. And the second half of the question, I'll deal with Sachin."

Now as we come out of the pendum, we expect a large part of that to stick. On the flip side, when you look at what cross-border trade related indexation looks like, in other words, 2021, current spend levels relative to 2019, they're running at about 40%. So if you believe that travel comes back, and we do believe that travel comes back. We see structurally the opportunity for upside growth coming from that as well.

I mean across the whole crypto space, I mean we want to play a role in CBDC. We want to play a role in private stable coins. We want to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets. So it's a broader space. Specifically in CBDC, I would describe it as relatively early days. So the engagement that we have and that's where we see our role to start with, is to answer the question that you just asked, in partnership with governments, is what is the right construct? What is the role of the private sector? And where we came out fortunately, as of late, there's been a few thought leadership pieces involving some of the leading central banks around the world, including the ECB and the Bank of England and so forth is, ideally, there's 2 tier system where the government takes the role of mining the currency, so to say, as they do in fiat and the private sector takes the role of distributing it. And the private sector, this comes to your question about the specific role that players could have, including us, is innovating around that. Innovating the true power of blockchain what else could it do other than facilitating a payment. So I think there is -- there's a direction that we like where this is going. So our concept of interoperability are also very important. Because the utility for a consumer or business will only come when you can do something with the Central Pipe digital currency. I think this example out of Bahamas is actually a very striking one. So here is a Mastercard partner program that allows you to spend on a CBDC unit that you have received at any place Mastercard is accepted. That's solving the last mile issue. Imagine how we could be doing this in so many countries. So is that engagement on model? Is that engagement on policy? Now as you try to do something like the bahamas, you got to test it and try it. And for now, we see our second role, in actually facilitating a real-life test bed, where you can iterate around the design and see how does this work. And that's not only for governments. Governments like that, Sandbox, they engage, but it's also to pull in the commercial banks because it needs to go in conjunction if you have a 2-tier system. So I see all of that and then I'll come to assume a scenario where this is in play, and it exists in a given country. We just talked about the Bahamas. There's this last mile issue. But there's also been the questions of what other applications can ride on this infrastructure. You've heard us talk about in the context of real-time payments, our go-to-market is always underlying infrastructure, application services, and we intend to do the same thing here. And that is what is an application that could ride on top of this, it could be a smart trade contract. So smart contract technology is what we're investing in, when I made the reference earlier, reinvesting in further blockchain technology. And then, of course, there are services. Everybody right now is asking us what should our blockchain strategy. Our Advisors team is all over that and there will be cyber questions. Governments are raising the question when a blockchain comes along, is that a backdoor for hackers? So our whole cyber solution space is also geared up to engage. So I think there's a role to play for the private sector and has a role to play very specifically for us to help the private sector and government."

As we think about the European union taking steps to allow vaccinated U.S. tourists into Europe, when we think about that corridor, the U.S. traveling to Europe, is that I imagine it's big enough to move a needle for cross border, but can you help us understand how meaningful like some key corridors would be if they reopen in strong ways for you? Or is it a highly dispersed set of corridors that you've got around the world that will take a lot of them coming back online."

So when you think about, first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe. You could see generally speaking, intra-Europe constitutes a fairly significant portion of our cross-border volumes. And you can see that from the metrics, which we've been sharing with you. And so that will depend upon how travel opens up within the intra-Europe border as kind of point one. Now but we recognize also that intra-Europe is lower-yielding than the other cross-border volume. So Ken, as you think about it, you should think about it in that context. 
Secondly, what I'd tell you is U.S. is an important outbound corridor. There's no question about that. But there are several corridor well beyond that. When I think about the Middle East and Africa, when I think about what's going on in Asia Pacific. These are all important quarters, big U.S. to Canada, another important co corridor. U.S. to Latin America and Mexico. These are all important corridors. I think the operative thing here is at least what we are spending a lot of time thinking about is not only about the rollout of vaccines is, but what are governments doing to establish travel bubbles. So you heard about Australia and New Zealand. You're hearing about Hong Kong, Singapore. You're hearing about China establishing some sort of POS. So there's a lot of work which is currently underway in terms of seeing, is there a level of comfort to open up our borders and to make it less onerous for people to travel. So it's in a 3-prong thing as far as I'm concerned: it's vaccines, it's the opening up and establishing a border kind of protocol and then the third is, have you made it less onerous for people travel. And you've got to look at all those 3 as you think about how cross-border comes back. Now on the proof points we've got so far are in corridors like U.S., Latin America, things have worked out pretty nicely. It's not that onerous. People are traveling. You've seen decent cross-border spend. Similarly, in the UAE, you've seen decent cross-border spend. A lot of this -- and one remind a quick Miu is a lot of our cross-border travel volume is personal travel, and we do expect personal travel will come back. And the leading indicator for that is we've seen it come back in the domestic environment pretty robustly. Now that you've taken away these commodity requirements in the context with the U.S. and several other countries. So that's the great color I would just wanted to share with you as you think about how this will play out going forward."

So I guess what I'd tell you, I tell you our experience based on what we've seen from the stimulus is, this round of stimulus has actually come into the flow from a spending standpoint, a lot more rapidly than the last front of stimulus had come through. What we've also experienced is that the dollar spent are not kind of once and done. So said differently, people are saving. And then there is the trickle effect, which comes to over a period of time. So it's our expectation that the impact of the stimulus will continue to be felt but at a declining pace as time goes along. Because we've started to see a lot of that come through in the early part right now, as I kind of just mentioned, you can see that in the strength in the numbers we've got. And then on your question on services, sound quarter on services again, look services continues to do really well. It does well from a revenue-generating capability. It also powers the core very effectively. You can see that in the way we're winning share. And I'm seeing a very strong pipeline in terms of what we're seeing from a services standpoint going forward. So I feel pretty good. And the way, again, I think about this is you have a set of existing capabilities. How do you deepen your penetration with your customer base, existing and new customers, and then you keep building on your services capabilities. For example, the acquisitions we recently done and how does contribute to growth on a going-forward basis. So I think when you add all of that up, I feel pretty good about our services growth trajectory going forward."

Now -- but that aside, we were excited in August 2019, and we're excited on March 3 when we had legal day wanted. We welcome to team in Copenhagen. And I'll tell you why we're excited. So with our existing set of multi-rail capabilities, particularly in the account-to-account space, we're well positioned with Vocalink. Vocalink has strong infrastructure capabilities, applications and helped us to build the services business. What Nest does is that gives us additional infrastructure capabilities because here's a significantly customizable high end solution that Vocalink brings, which works for large established markets that have had some journey in real-time payments. And then there's nets, which is a more nimble platform that allows us to deal with the smaller markets and take on more in a shorter period of time. So there's complementary assets here and that if you look across that, it makes us the one-stop shelf partner when it comes to real-time payments, and that is unsurpassed. There's nothing else out there at this point in time. On the application side, I'm even more excited because here, what we're having is we're not just getting technological capability with this purchase and we can bolt-on to what we've already done in Voca Lake. But we're getting scaled businesses that are live in market. There are strong bill payment propositions and volumes with large customer reached in, particularly in the Nordics regions, but other parts of Europe as well. So we've identified bill pay as a growth opportunity sometime back here in the U.S. and now we're bolting that on. And then we have the choice of taking some of our U.S. capabilities into other parts of the world or do the same with net. So that is accelerating our growth in the application space, which I'm particularly focused on. I think last but not least, did they have activities in the open banking space and few services around real-time payments. So that just rounds off the picture. And I come back to Legal day one. We're getting a fantastic team of engineers and experts in this space that is just really rounding off of our capability side. Now the aspect on how this might look different. So addition, you made that reference. And I all want to remind us, there was a remedy that we had put on the table in kind of negotiations with the EU commission throughout the approval process. And it basically means we will license the net infrastructure technology to a licensee and the licensee was identified as part of the approval process. That allows -- but that is on the infrastructure side, not much of an issue because we have other assets to compete and we can use it ourselves. So we're not excluded here. Package of having infrastructure application and service altogether, I think, makes such a differentiated proposition that we were quite happy to give that remedy. It made the EU commission happy. And it comes back to the point about yes. This is particularly important in Europe because in Europe, being seen as a true European partner, we have the commission put a stand of approval on this transaction, and that works well for us. But we're going to take it elsewhere, for sure. I mean, that's the whole plan."

We never missed a single step there and neither did government this was really driven by a lot of governments trying to get stimulus money into their citizens' hands, and they couldn't do it fast enough, and they couldn't do it in an efficient enough way. So the focus and the light shed on real-time payment infrastructure was certainly helped. So I would see there is an increasing engagement around account to account. Throughout the pandemic, if you look at what else was going on. You saw the 2-factor authentication thing in Europe for strong customer authentication, I think, is the actual technical term there. That moved over throughout the pandemic. So the government, the financial sector players in Europe advanced that. And that was broadly it. And then you look at what we've done with open banking I mentioned it earlier. That's, again, a regulator driven aspect of payments and the broader financial services here at Tesco.

Whereas the numerator, which is domestic assessments, is only the revenue we own on our domestic volumes. So depending on how that mix moves around, you're going to see that yield move around as well. And then there are other moving parts in domestic assessments. The card fees and those kind of things, which actually featured in there as well.

So throughout the pandemic, as you rightly said, there was clearly a relative rise in debit over credit transactions. The way I look at this is, this is a time of economic uncertainty, frankly, certainly in general. And in those times, people generally prefer to spend money they have and have more control over that. So that is what we've seen in previous crisis. So no surprise there. As this crisis induced. We've seen that benefit from stimulus payments because they are attached to a bank account. So we saw that. And then you looked at how the mix of spending has changed in terms of overweight to everyday spend versus discretionary spend, and that is just there's a lot of historical consumer behavior in grain in that is that you use debit for more everyday spend. That is what we're seeing in many markets around the world, and that has played out here as well. So now the question is, what of that is going to stick back to what we said earlier in terms of trends. And in the end, that's hard to predict.

And you will also see that the discretionary spend categories are coming back. We're already seeing this in the last 3 weeks when I look at the first 3 weeks of April here. So you start to see travel. Strong travel programs, and it's very, I think, reasonable to expect that a lot of that is going to drive credit growth back up. So we're going to see a bit of a balancing. Now, for us, I think the strategy has to be -- we have to have the best solutions across debit and credit. And frankly, beyond cards as well because we just talked about earlier how the overall payment landscape is changing. And that's where the focus is. That's why we lean in on the travel side, but that's also why we lean in on debit, and you're right, NatWest, Deutsche, Santander, it's in conversion right now, as I said earlier, and that's going to be good for us and we try to bring our best solutions forward with consumers. So Sachin, I don't know if you have any."

The point I'd make rig in addition is, obviously, increase secular shift which is taking place. I think you were alluding to the fact that the first point of replacement of cash happens to be debit. We're certainly seeing that come through. But like Michael said, there will be some level of reversion to the mean. The one point I'd make is, the way we look at it even from a product life cycle standpoint is people tend to start when you think about financial inclusion and you think about how people come into spending in electronic forms, they start with prepay, they move to debit, then they start getting their tore into credit. And that's just the natural evolution, which will take place. We want to have a balanced portfolio. We want to win across the board, and we want to be ready to actually address those spend as they come across demeanor product."

We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre pandemic trends. We continue to execute against our strategic objectives as we signed notable new deals, advanced our multirail strategy by closing our transaction with Nets and extended our digital identity capabilities with the planned acquisition of [indiscernible]. 
So let's dive it, looking at the broader economy first. Domestic spending levels showed continued improvement with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our quarter 1 spending pulse report, which is based on all tender types, U.S. retail sales were up 11.8% versus a year ago ex auto, ex gas. This reflects the impact of fiscal stimulus and the lapping of the start of the pandemic. 
Spending costs also indicated that overall European retail sales at close to flat in quarter 1 versus a year ago. The vaccine rollout has become scale in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries. And broadening this critical effort is underway, but will take time. 
Let's start with our business, specifically. At the 4 Phrases framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. At this time last year, markets were going through the containment and stabilization phases. We now believe many markets are transitioning from the normalization phase to the growth phase domestically. Cross-border travel spending continues to be in the stabilization phase where spending is restricted due to closed borders. 
Looking at Mastercard spending trends, volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across products. We saw particular strength in debit, primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and share gains. In terms of how people are spending, e-commerce continues to be strong and we're seeing improvements in card-present spending. 
On the travel front, we've seen some recent improvement in domestic travel, primarily personal travel. Cross-border travel remains limited as border restrictions remain in place for most markets. Cross-border card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to hold up well. 
As we have observed in many markets, progress is not always linear. And we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel, as we've just seen in domestic travel. We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs. 
International travel should start to open on a select basis in the second half of the year between countries, the strong vaccination programs and/or low case rates. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, engaging travelers early through our loyalty programs and expanding relationships with our partners in travel. As a result, we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. 
As we look forward and see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, we will increase the investment we put toward our strategic priorities: one, for payments; two, deploying a broader set of services; three, enabling digital solutions and four, providing choice with multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long term, along with expense discipline. 
Let me illustrate how we're executing against each of these strategic priorities. I will begin by sharing how we're driving growth in the core, always supported by differentiated services capabilities. Here are a few key examples. Building on our strength in U.S. retail co-brands, we're excited that Mastercard has chosen as the exclusive network for gapping, co-branded credit cards across the old Navy, gap, Banana Republic and Asefa brands. This partnership will include a reimagined rewards program to drive increased customer engagement with the migration of existing card members planned for 2022. 
It has a long-term services relationship with GAAP, which led to additional opportunities to support both their co-brand programs and their broader business. We're also leveraging our differentiated service to expand relationships with key global partners like Santander. This quarter, we signed a new deal with Santander Brazil and executed a long-term exclusive partnership with Superdigital's, Santanders fintech arm, to provide digital prepaid accounts across 7 Latin American markets. 
Also, we're happy to announce that the financial arm of one of the largest retailers in Europe, [indiscernible] is migrating its entire closed-loop consumer credit portfolio to Mastercard exclusively for 10 years. This strategic partnership includes our processing capabilities and will contribute to growing Mastercard's overall credit share in the region. 
Talking about share. I'd also like to point out that the migration of Santander U.K. debit portfolio is progressing well, and we're preparing for the other conversions to be previously announced. Finally, we secured several strategic renewals and expansions. As many of you know, Huntington Bank announced its anticipated acquisition of TCF at the end of last year, which will make them a top 10 U.S. regional Bank. I'm happy that they have decided to both renew their existing business with us and convert the TCF business to Mastercard. 
This brings significant new debit volume to our brands. We've also expanded our relationship with Synchrony Bank, as the exclusive partner for their general purpose consumer credit portfolio. 
Turning to the next strategic priority. We continue to enable digital solutions to drive the secular shift to electronic payments. A great example of this can be seen through the partnerships we have established with several leading mobile telecom providers across Africa and other regions. 
In Africa, there are more mobile money accounts and bank accounts and consumers increasingly expect digital financial services to be provided through their mobile phones. Now we signed a multiyear partnership with the MTN group to enable millions of their MTN mobile money wallet customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution. 
We've also expanded our partnership with the Airtel Group to equip their Airtel money customers with virtual cards and QR solutions. And we've extended our partnership with the Airtel Payments Bank in India along with the recent investment in Airtel Mobile Commerce. 
While our digital capabilities are enabling us to penetrate new geographies, our multi-rail strategy is allowing us to provide greater choice and capture new payment flows. We're happy that we have now completed the acquisition of the majority of the Corporate Services division of Nets, which reinforces our leadership position in providing real-time payments, infrastructure and applications. This transaction significantly enhances our application capabilities, inclusive of a robust set of bill payment solutions, which are operating at scale across several markets. 
Furthermore, this is an integral component of our regional strategy in Europe, enabling us to operate as a local partner. We see significant opportunity to expand these capabilities into additional markets around the world. Speaking of Bill Pay in the U.S., we continue to scale our BIP exchange solution through new billers and bank partners. We're excited to announce that Verizon will connect with the most recent national Disa on the platform. 
Turning to cross-border applications. We have now fully integrated our acquisition of Transfast and can now provide unsurpassed reach via a single point of access that allows banks and digital partners to send and receive money through bank accounts, mobile wallets, costs, and cash payouts to over 90% of the world's population in more than 100 countries. We're expanding our relationships with the United Nations Federal Credit Union, the Saudi Bede Bank to expand their reach into additional markets. And both Bancorp and IDT payment services will now leverage our capabilities for cross-border evinces. 
And in addition, we have extended our partnership with Western Union, who will be using our capabilities to allow customers in 18 European countries to transfer funds directly to debit cards in near real time. 
Our multi-rail capabilities are critically important to our efforts in open banking as well. They enable us to provide our customers across banks and fintechs with greater flexibility in how they manage both payment and data flows. We're off to a strong start as in Icity as we've integrated our sales teams and already signed several new connectivity partners and application users. 
For example, go live with our state-of-the-art API-based data access in several large banks, including U.S. bank, as well as with the leading payroll processor, representing millions of employees. 
Finicity was also selected by companies like Upgrade, SWBC, Mcafee, Moneylion and Tomo credit to provide permission-based access to financial data to support a variety of use cases, including mortgage, lending and, of course, payments. We're expanding our open banking capabilities in Europe as well as we now live with our open Banking Connect solution with Lloyds Bank in the U.K. for consumers to make payments to their credit cards. 
We continue to see a great deal of interest and activity in digital currencies, and we're innovating in this space through new crypto and CBDC partnerships, enabling digital currencies on our network, and continuing our investments and underlying blockchain technology as part of our multi-rail strategy. 
We have several new crypto partnerships approved for launch this quarter, including a partnership with Gemini, a leading crypto platform here in the U.S. to launch a first of its kind cryptocurrency rewards credit card that allows consumers to receive crypto rewards on everyday purchases. 
And over in Spain, crypton, a crypto exchange launching a Mastercard cryptocard. On Central Bank digital currencies, we continue to engage with central banks around the world. And our virtual testing platform, it's helping them design features, similar issuance and evaluate interoperability with existing payment systems. In partnership with the Central Bank of Bahamas and Island Pay, we launched the world's first CBDC linked payment card, enabling people to pay for goods and services using fiat currency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. 
Digital identity. Digital identity is critically important as the shift to a digital economy continues. It is a foundational component of our multilayered approach to security and have allowed us to help consumers and businesses safely and easily prove their identity while enabling them to main control over their information. 
Last week, we announced the planned acquisition, [indiscernible], which advances the digital identity efforts we have underway. I content has access to validated identity information on a global basis and leverages artificial intelligence to produce highly accurate identity stores. [indiscernible] insights support multiple payment and nonpayment use cases, including new account openings, instant issuance and transaction risk checks to use by a broad range of customers, including leading digital merchants, financial institutions, travel companies and digital currency platforms. This is an example of how we are entering into adjacent areas and innovating beyond the core payment transaction. 
And now back to the bigger picture. We're leveraging our business to have a broader impact on society by executing our commitment to bring 1 billion people into the digital economy by 2025. Specifically on the environmental front, we have pledged to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050 and issued a sustainability bond in the last quarter to support these efforts. 
Furthermore, our Mastercard carbon calculator developed in collaboration economy, is enabled on our network to provide consumers to the snapshot of carbon emissions generated by their purchases. And we've worked with customers to issue over 10 million cards using sustainable materials. If we tie all of this together, we are now linking executive comp to Mastercard's sustainability priorities. 
With all of that in mind, I continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead, and I'm happy with the progress we're making against our objectives. And with that, Sachin, over to you."

So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net r",1485,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everybody. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 2%, returning to positive growth for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in Q2 2020 and includes a 1 PPT benefit from acquisitions. 
Operating expenses increased 7%, which includes a full ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was down 1%, and net income was down 6%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 5% year-over-year to $1.74, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $418 million through April 26, 2021. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing sequential improvement in both debit and credit as vaccination progress takes hold and mobility increases. 
In addition, debit growth is being further strengthened by fiscal stimulus and share gains. U.S. GDV increased by 14% with debit growth of 26% and a decline in credit of 1%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 5% with debit growth of 12% and a decline in credit of 2%. 
Cross-border volume was down 17% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes down 11% and other cross-border volumes down 23%. 
Turning to Page 5. Switch transactions grew 9% in the first quarter globally. Card-not-present growth rates have accelerated during the past year and continue at those elevated levels. While card-present transactions are now growing above 2019 levels for the first time since the peak of the pandemic. 
In addition, card growth was 6%. And we bally, there are $2.8 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cost issue. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 2% was primarily driven by domestic transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by lower cross-border volume fees and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 8%, in line with worldwide GDV growth of 8%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 26%, while cross-border volumes decreased 17%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross border volumes. 
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switch transactions were up 9%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily driven by adverse mix. Other revenues were up 27%, including a 3 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and data and services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 4%. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 7%. This includes a OPBG increase from acquisitions and a 3 ppt increase related to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. Excluding these items, expenses were flat as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities while keeping an eye on top line growth. 
Turning now to [indiscernible] Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of April. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, primarily due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began mostly in March of last year. Hence, to provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at the spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switch volumes, they have shown steady sequential improvement, continuing along the same trend line we saw in Q1. This is driven primarily by the U.S., which has benefited from the recent fiscal sementes. We have seen improvements in discretionary categories like clothing, furniture and sporting goods. And we have also seen some recent strength in personal domestic travel in the U.S. and the U.K., which we are making strong progress in vaccinations. 
For instance, we have seen U.S. airline spend essentially doubled over the last 4 weeks relative to where it was earlier in Q1. Trends in switch transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switch volumes. 
In terms of cross border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 remained mostly unchanged through the start of April. We continue to see very strong growth in card-not-present cross-border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend. However, border restrictions remain widespread and to cross-border travel, which is card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes continues to be impacted. 
As you can see from the numbers, there is a significant opportunity for improvement in cross-border travel. In fact, where borders are open, such as Mexico, certain Latin American countries and the UAE, we have seen problem improve. 
Turning to Page 9. I want to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and feel we are very well positioned to grow with the new and renew deals we have signed over the last several quarters. 
We have positioned ourselves for the return of travel with travel oriented portfolios and have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a healthy rate and has helped diversify our revenue base. In terms of the macro environment, domestic spending levels have continued to improve, entering the growth phase this quarter, supported in part by fiscal stimulus and the rollout of effective vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has been uneven, however. And as a result, we expect the pace of recovery to vary from country to country. 
As Michael said, we do believe there is significant pent of demand for travel and are already seeing domestic travel improve. In terms of cross border, we believe that in the second half of the year, we will see additional borders open, particularly between those countries with low infection rates and/or advanced vaccination programs. 
Turning to the second quarter. Spending levels continue on their current trajectory, we would expect Q2 net revenues to grow around a low to mid 20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. 
It is important to point out that this is just one potential scenario, which could be impacted by factors such as more restrictive measures being put in place because of rising infections for the opening or closing of borders terms of operating expenses, we continue our disciplined expense management approach while furthering our strategic imperatives and keeping an eye on top line growth as we progress through the growth phase of the pandemic domestically, we will look to increase our investments in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our multi Real solutions as well as begin to increase our advertising and marketing-related spend. 
For Q2, we expect operating expenses to grow at a rate in the low 20s versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are now beginning to lap the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic hit. 
With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have announced the planned acquisition of ICASA and have now closed on the transaction with Nets. And expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q2 and for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in the second quarter and 8 to 9 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year, after which time, we do not split them out. 
Other items to keep in mind, foreign exchange. Is expected to be a 2 to 3 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 3 to 4 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q2. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rate environment. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

The -- we started that activity with a pilot that we launched in Australia about a year ago that is now going live in partnership with the Australian telecom, Optos, where we are introducing a reusable digital identity. What it contacts us is it accelerates our efforts and accelerates our efforts because Ikata has access to verifiable data data points that allow to establish an identity.

I know you had given us a little bit of help on that for the first quarter. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on Q2. And then just wondering if we can get a quick comment on Opex. I know that on an organic constant currency basis, the second quarter OpEx is growing about in line with net revenue. So is that kind of the right general model to think about in the second half as well if the recovery progresses in line with your base case? Or does the second quarter have more catch up OpEx spend in it?"

So let me take your rebates and incentives question first. Look, I mean, rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percent",342,"Thanks, Jason. So let me take your rebates and incentives question first. Look, I mean, rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially as domestic spending recovers and new and renewed deals come online. I think you're aware about the fact that our domestic volumes are more indexed -- revance tires are more indexed domestic volumes. There are less indexed to cross-border. So depending on how that volume mix plays out, things might move around. But generally speaking, we expect rebate incentives as a percentage of growth to be up from current levels, pretty much the remainder of the year as volumes recover. 
On your second question around Opex, look, as we look forward, we see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, and we will increase the investment we put forward towards our strategic priorities. And these are essentially the ones we've talked about growing our share of core payments, ensuring that they do experience for our customers, driving a broader set of services capabilities, executing on our material strategy as well as our BTWOB strategy. As we do this, we will keep an eye on both the top line as well as the bottom line. And we will basically be very focused on making sure that we are making investments to drive the long-term growth of our business. And that's kind of the essential thing I'd like to leave you with, which is we will continue to stay this split from  an expense management standpoint. We see domestic spending is transitioning towards the growth phase, which gives us confidence and vaccines are effective and they're being deployed at scale. So we will keep an eye on all of those metrics, we will keep an eye on the top line, and we will look to invest in the business to drive that long-term growth objective, which we're talking about."

And the",544,"Warren, let me start off with the structural changes. I mean, that's the key question. What makes a trend? What will stick? We have, over the last 14 months, on a monthly basis, helps consumers around the world, small businesses around the world. And the input that we're getting from this research remains unchanged. That is fundamentally starting with increasing consumer confidence, spending is going up. And then when you look at the way how people spend, what we're hearing is when the pandemic subsides, 70% of people are saying, I'm going to continue to use more online commerce than I have before the pandemic. Almost 70% of us saying it's the same thing for digital -- for digital banking. Almost the same number says more for contactless. And then you look at the other side of the coin, and that is about 60% of people are saying, I will actually use less cash. So we believe that these trends of elevated anything elevated online will prevail, maybe not at the same levels, but they will be elevated. At the same time, we're already seeing that in countries where strong vaccination programs are there and social distancing measures are reduced. That the spend in-store is coming back. So people do want to go and spend at the local restaurant or support the local shop in their local main street. So the good thing is we're ready for both with our solutions. So that is around consumer behavior, the changing consumer as we turn out of this nightmare. And then you look at what else is going on? And what else are we seeing is with this push towards a more digital economy, we're seeing there's more data around. And the first for data analytics is increasing. Our services teams can't be running fast enough to satisfy that first. If you look at more data, you look at an increasing cyber footprint. So our cyber solutions, that is going to be it's going to be a continuing trend. Earlier, we talked a little bit about our multi-rail strategy and what we're doing there. I talked about Europe and being a local partner, government is interested in teeters government is interested in real-time payments and crypto Central Bank digital currency. So this whole trend of government leaning in I think is important. So our focus on the government vertical is going to help us there. And finally, just came across the news over the last couple of days is the dependence on international supply chains is showing up. It shows up in the context of vaccine distribution at, but it has been showing up across many different industries. So there is a real push to digitize supply chains, make them more flexible. And of course, that comes to payments as well and comes to associated data flows. So B2B should also be seeing quite a push out of -- as we turn out I so it's a shifting picture. And Darrin, I agree with you that there's a lot of things to feel positive about in terms of our strategy is on point for all these drivers. That's why we're increasing the investment behind these. And the second half of the question, I'll deal with Sachin."

On the flip side, when you look at what cross-border trade related indexation looks like, in other words, 2021, current spend levels relative to 2019, they're running at about 40%. So if you believe that travel comes back, and we do believe that travel comes back. We see structurally the opportunity for upside growth coming from that as well.

I mean across the whole crypto space, I mean we want to play a role in CBDC. We want to play a role in private stable coins. We want to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets. So it's a broader space. Specifically in CBDC, I would describe it as relatively early days. So the engagement that we have and that's where we see our role to start with, is to answer the question that you just asked, in partnership with governments, is what is the right construct? What is the role of the private sector? And where we came out fortunately, as of late, there's been a few thought leadership pieces involving some of the leading central banks around the world, including the ECB and the Bank of England and so forth is, ideally, there's 2 tier system where the government takes the role of mining the currency, so to say, as they do in fiat and the private sector takes the role of distributing it. And the private sector, this comes to your question about the specific role that players could have, including us, is innovating around that. Innovating the true power of blockchain what else could it do other than facilitating a payment. So I think there is -- there's a direction that we like where this is going. So our concept of interoperability are also very important. Because the utility for a consumer or business will only come when you can do something with the Central Pipe digital currency. I think this example out of Bahamas is actually a very striking one. So here is a Mastercard partner program that allows you to spend on a CBDC unit that you have received at any place Mastercard is accepted. That's solving the last mile issue. Imagine how we could be doing this in so many countries. So is that engagement on model? Is that engagement on policy? Now as you try to do something like the bahamas, you got to test it and try it. And for now, we see our second role, in actually facilitating a real-life test bed, where you can iterate around the design and see how does this work. And that's not only for governments. Governments like that, Sandbox, they engage, but it's also to pull in the commercial banks because it needs to go in conjunction if you have a 2-tier system. So I see all of that and then I'll come to assume a scenario where this is in play, and it exists in a given country. We just talked about the Bahamas. There's this last mile issue. But there's also been the questions of what other applications can ride on this infrastructure. You've heard us talk about in the context of real-time payments, our go-to-market is always underlying infrastructure, application services, and we intend to do the same thing here. And that is what is an application that could ride on top of this, it could be a smart trade contract. So smart contract technology is what we're investing in, when I made the reference earlier, reinvesting in further blockchain technology. And then, of course, there are services. Everybody right now is asking us what should our blockchain strategy. Our Advisors team is all over that and there will be cyber questions. Governments are raising the question when a blockchain comes along, is that a backdoor for hackers? So our whole cyber solution space is also geared up to engage. So I think there's a role to play for the private sector and has a role to play very specifically for us to help the private sector and government."

Or is it a highly dispersed set of corridors that you've got around the world that will take a lot of them coming back online."

So when you think about, first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe. You could see generally speaking, intra-Europe constitutes a fairly significant portion of our cross-border volumes. And you can see that from the metrics, which we've been sharing with you. And so that will depend upon how travel opens up within the intra-Europe border as kind of point one. Now but we recognize also that intra-Europe is lower-yielding than the other cross-border volume. So Ken, as you think about it, you should think about it in that context. 
Secondly, what I'd tell you is U.S. is an important outbound corridor. There's no question about that. But there are several corridor well beyond that. When I think about the Middle East and Africa, when I think about what's going on in Asia Pacific. These are all important quarters, big U.S. to Canada, another important co corridor. U.S. to Latin America and Mexico. These are all important corridors. I think the operative thing here is at least what we are spending a lot of time thinking about is not only about the rollout of vaccines is, but what are governments doing to establish travel bubbles. So you heard about Australia and New Zealand. You're hearing about Hong Kong, Singapore. You're hearing about China establishing some sort of POS. So there's a lot of work which is currently underway in terms of seeing, is there a level of comfort to open up our borders and to make it less onerous for people to travel. So it's in a 3-prong thing as far as I'm concerned: it's vaccines, it's the opening up and establishing a border kind of protocol and then the third is, have you made it less onerous for people travel. And you've got to look at all those 3 as you think about how cross-border comes back. Now on the proof points we've got so far are in corridors like U.S., Latin America, things have worked out pretty nicely. It's not that onerous. People are traveling. You've seen decent cross-border spend. Similarly, in the UAE, you've seen decent cross-border spend. A lot of this -- and one remind a quick Miu is a lot of our cross-border travel volume is personal travel, and we do expect personal travel will come back. And the leading indicator for that is we've seen it come back in the domestic environment pretty robustly. Now that you've taken away these commodity requirements in the context with the U.S. and several other countries. So that's the great color I would just wanted to share with you as you think about how this will play out going forward."

So I guess what I'd tell you, I tell you our experience based on what we've seen from the stimulus is, this round of stimulus has actually come into the flow from a spending standpoint, a lot more rapidly than the last front of stimulus had come through. What we've also experienced is that the dollar spent are not kind of once and done. So said differently, people are saving. And then there is the trickle effect, which comes to over a period of time. So it's our expectation that the impact of the stimulus will continue to be felt but at a declining pace as time goes along. Because we've started to see a lot of that come through in the early part right now, as I kind of just mentioned, you can see that in the strength in the numbers we've got. And then on your question on services, sound quarter on services again, look services continues to do really well. It does well from a revenue-generating capability. It also powers the core very effectively. You can see that in the way we're winning share. And I'm seeing a very strong pipeline in terms of what we're seeing from a services standpoint going forward. So I feel pretty good. And the way, again, I think about this is you have a set of existing capabilities. How do you deepen your penetration with your customer base, existing and new customers, and then you keep building on your services capabilities. For example, the acquisitions we recently done and how does contribute to growth on a going-forward basis.

Now -- but that aside, we were excited in August 2019, and we're excited on March 3 when we had legal day wanted. We welcome to team in Copenhagen. And I'll tell you why we're excited. So with our existing set of multi-rail capabilities, particularly in the account-to-account space, we're well positioned with Vocalink. Vocalink has strong infrastructure capabilities, applications and helped us to build the services business. What Nest does is that gives us additional infrastructure capabilities because here's a significantly customizable high end solution that Vocalink brings, which works for large established markets that have had some journey in real-time payments. And then there's nets, which is a more nimble platform that allows us to deal with the smaller markets and take on more in a shorter period of time. So there's complementary assets here and that if you look across that, it makes us the one-stop shelf partner when it comes to real-time payments, and that is unsurpassed. There's nothing else out there at this point in time. On the application side, I'm even more excited because here, what we're having is we're not just getting technological capability with this purchase and we can bolt-on to what we've already done in Voca Lake. But we're getting scaled businesses that are live in market. There are strong bill payment propositions and volumes with large customer reached in, particularly in the Nordics regions, but other parts of Europe as well. So we've identified bill pay as a growth opportunity sometime back here in the U.S. and now we're bolting that on. And then we have the choice of taking some of our U.S. capabilities into other parts of the world or do the same with net. So that is accelerating our growth in the application space, which I'm particularly focused on. I think last but not least, did they have activities in the open banking space and few services around real-time payments. So that just rounds off the picture. And I come back to Legal day one. We're getting a fantastic team of engineers and experts in this space that is just really rounding off of our capability side. Now the aspect on how this might look different. So addition, you made that reference. And I all want to remind us, there was a remedy that we had put on the table in kind of negotiations with the EU commission throughout the approval process. And it basically means we will license the net infrastructure technology to a licensee and the licensee was identified as part of the approval process. That allows -- but that is on the infrastructure side, not much of an issue because we have other assets to compete and we can use it ourselves. So we're not excluded here. Package of having infrastructure application and service altogether, I think, makes such a differentiated proposition that we were quite happy to give that remedy. It made the EU commission happy. And it comes back to the point about yes. This is particularly important in Europe because in Europe, being seen as a true European partner, we have the commission put a stand of approval on this transaction, and that works well for us. But we're going to take it elsewhere, for sure. I mean, that's the whole plan."

We never missed a single step there and neither did government this was really driven by a lot of governments trying to get stimulus money into their citizens' hands, and they couldn't do it fast enough, and they couldn't do it in an efficient enough way. So the focus and the light shed on real-time payment infrastructure was certainly helped. So I would see there is an increasing engagement around account to account. Throughout the pandemic, if you look at what else was going on. You saw the 2-factor authentication thing in Europe for strong customer authentication, I think, is the actual technical term there. That moved over throughout the pandemic. So the government, the financial sector players in Europe advanced that. And that was broadly it. And then you look at what we've done with open banking I mentioned it earlier. That's, again, a regulator driven aspect of payments and the broader financial services here at Tesco.

Look, I mean, we've seen a little bit of recovery in domestic assessment yields in the first quarter relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter. That number kind of moves around, right? And it moves around, there's a whole bunch of stuff, which is kind of going on in there. Because remember, in the denominator when you're doing yield calculations, we talk about GAV. I think the natural instinct is to think about GDD only as domestic volumes. It's a composition of domestic and cross border volumes. Whereas the numerator, which is domestic assessments, is only the revenue we own on our domestic volumes. So depending on how that mix moves around, you're going to see that yield move around as well. And then there are other moving parts in domestic assessments. The card fees and those kind of things, which actually featured in there as well. But by and large, I would tell you, between the fourth quarter of 2019, going into the first quarter of 2021, our yields held pretty steady if I take those 2 endpoints. They bounced around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but they're now pretty steady."

So throughout the pandemic, as you rightly said, there was clearly a relative rise in debit over credit transactions. The way I look at this is, this is a time of economic uncertainty, frankly, certainly in general. And in those times, people generally prefer to spend money they have and have more control over that. So that is what we've seen in previous crisis. So no surprise there. As this crisis induced. We've seen that benefit from stimulus payments because they are attached to a bank account. So we saw that. And then you looked at how the mix of spending has changed in terms of overweight to everyday spend versus discretionary spend, and that is just there's a lot of historical consumer behavior in grain in that is that you use debit for more everyday spend. That is what we're seeing in many markets around the world, and that has played out here as well. So now the question is, what of that is going to stick back to what we said earlier in terms of trends. And in the end, that's hard to predict. I do think what we're going to see is that the crisis in use spend is -- the trigger there is going to go away because this nightmare will be over at some point, hopefully soon. And you will also see that the discretionary spend categories are coming back. We're already seeing this in the last 3 weeks when I look at the first 3 weeks of April here. So you start to see travel. Strong travel programs, and it's very, I think, reasonable to expect that a lot of that is going to drive credit growth back up. So we're going to see a bit of a balancing. Now, for us, I think the strategy has to be -- we have to have the best solutions across debit and credit. And frankly, beyond cards as well because we just talked about earlier how the overall payment landscape is changing. And that's where the focus is. That's why we lean in on the travel side, but that's also why we lean in on debit, and you're right, NatWest, Deutsche, Santander, it's in conversion right now, as I said earlier, and that's going to be good for us and we try to bring our best solutions forward with consumers. So Sachin, I don't know if you have any."

We're certainly seeing that come through. But like Michael said, there will be some level of reversion to the mean. The one point I'd make is, the way we look at it even from a product life cycle standpoint is people tend to start when you think about financial inclusion and you think about how people come into spending in electronic forms, they start with prepay, they move to debit, then they start getting their tore into credit. And that's just the natural evolution, which will take place. We want to have a balanced portfolio. We want to win across the board, and we want to be ready to actually address those spend as they come across demeanor product."

We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre-pandemic trends. We continue to execute against our strategic objectives as we signed notable new deals, advanced our multi-rail strategy by closing our transaction with Nets and extended our digital identity capabilities with the planned acquisition of Ekata.
So let's dive in, looking at the broader economy first. Domestic spending levels showed continued improvement with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our quarter 1 spending pulse report, which is based on all tender types, U.S. retail sales were up 11.8% versus a year ago ex auto, ex gas. This reflects the impact of fiscal stimulus and the lapping of the start of the pandemic. 
Spending costs also indicated that overall European retail sales got close to flat in quarter 1 versus a year ago. The vaccine rollout has become scaled in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries. And broadening this critical effort is underway, but will take time. 
Let's start with our business, specifically, and the 4 phases framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. At this time last year, markets were going through the containment and stabilization phases. We now believe many markets are transitioning from the normalization phase to the growth phase domestically. Cross-border travel spending continues to be in the stabilization phase, where spending is restricted due to closed borders. 
Looking at Mastercard spending trends, volumes continued to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across products. We saw particular strength in debit, primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and share gains. In terms of how people are spending, e-commerce continues to be strong and we're seeing improvements in card-present spending. 
On the travel front, we've seen some recent improvements in domestic travel, primarily personal travel. Cross-border travel remains limited as border restrictions remain in place for most markets. Cross-border card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to hold up well. 
As we have observed in many markets, progress is not always linear. And we believe there's significant pent-up demand for travel, as we've just seen in domestic travel. We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs. 
International travel should start to open on a select basis in the second half of the year between countries, the strong vaccination programs and/or low case rates. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, engaging travelers early through our loyalty programs and expanding relationships with our partners in travel. As a result, we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. 
As we look forward and see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, we will increase the investment we put toward our strategic priorities: one, for payments; two, deploying a broader set of services; three, enabling digital solutions; and four, providing choice with multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long term, along with expense discipline. 
Let me illustrate how we're executing against each of these strategic priorities. I will begin by sharing how we're driving growth in the core, always supported by differentiated services capabilities. Here are a few key examples. Building on our strength in U.S. retail co-brands, we're excited that Mastercard was chosen as the exclusive network for Gap Inc.'s co-branded credit cards across the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. This partnership will include a reimagined rewards program to drive increased customer engagements, with the migration of existing card members planned for 2022. 
We've had a long-term services relationship with Gap, which led to additional opportunities to support both their co-brand programs and their broader business. 
We're also leveraging our differentiated service to expand relationships with key global partners like Santander. This quarter, we signed a new deal with Santander Brazil and executed a long-term exclusive partnership with Superdigital, Santanders fintech arm, to provide digital prepaid accounts across 7 Latin American markets. 
Also, we're happy to announce that the financial arm of one of the largest retailers in Europe, El Corte Ingles, is migrating its entire closed-loop consumer credit portfolio to Mastercard exclusively for 10 years. This strategic partnership includes our processing capabilities and will contribute to growing Mastercard's overall credit share in the region. 
Talking about share. I'd also like to point out that the migration of Santander U.K. debit portfolio is progressing well, and we're preparing for the other conversions to be previously announced. Finally, we secured several strategic renewals and expansions. As many of you know, Huntington Bank announced its anticipated acquisition of TCF at the end of last year, which will make them a top 10 U.S. regional bank. I'm happy that they have decided to both renew their existing business with us and convert the TCF business to Mastercard. This brings significant new debit volume to our brands. We've also expanded our relationship with Synchrony Bank, as the exclusive partner for their general purpose consumer credit portfolio. 
Turning to the next strategic priority. We continue to enable digital solutions to drive the secular shift to electronic payments. A great example of this can be seen through the partnerships we have established with several leading mobile telecom providers across Africa and other regions. 
In Africa, there are more mobile money accounts than bank accounts and consumers increasingly expect digital financial services to be provided through their mobile phones. Now we signed a multiyear partnership with the MTN group to enable millions of their MTN mobile money wallet customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution. 
We've also expanded our partnership with the Airtel group to equip their Airtel money customers with virtual cards and QR solutions. And we've extended our partnership with the Airtel Payments Bank in India along with the recent investment in Airtel Mobile Commerce. 
While our digital capabilities are enabling us to penetrate new geographies, our multi-rail strategy is allowing us to provide greater choice and capture new payment flows. We're happy that we have now completed the acquisition of the majority of the Corporate Services division of Nets, which reinforces our leadership position in providing real-time payments, infrastructure and applications. This transaction significantly enhances our application capabilities, inclusive of a robust set of bill payment solutions, which are operating at scale across several markets. 
Furthermore, this is an integral component of our regional strategy in Europe, enabling us to operate as a local partner. We see significant opportunity to expand these capabilities into additional markets around the world. 
Speaking of Bill Pay, in the U.S., we continue to scale our Bill Pay Exchange solution through new billers and bank partners. We're excited to announce that Verizon will connect as the most recent national biller on the platform. 
Turning to cross-border applications. We have now fully integrated our acquisition of Transfast and can now provide unsurpassed reach via a single point of access that allows banks and digital partners to send and receive money through bank accounts, mobile wallets, [ cards ], and cash payouts to over 90% of the world's population in more than 100 countries. We're expanding our relationships with the United Nations Federal Credit Union, Saudi British Bank to expand their reach into additional markets. And both Bancorp and IDT payment services will now leverage our capabilities for cross-border advantages. 
And in addition, we have extended our partnership with Western Union, who will be using our capabilities to allow customers in 18 European countries to transfer funds directly to debit cards in near real time. 
Our multi-rail capabilities are critically important to our efforts in open banking as well. They enable us to provide our customers across banks and fintechs with greater flexibility in how they manage both payment and data flows. We're off to a strong start at Finicity as we've integrated our sales teams and already signed several new connectivity partners and application users. 
For example, we're live with our state-of-the-art API-based data access in several large banks, including U.S. Bank, as well as with the leading payroll processor, representing millions of employees. 
Finicity was also selected by companies like Upgrade, SWBC, MoCaFi, MoneyLion and TomoCredit to provide permission-based access to financial data to support a variety of use cases, including mortgage, lending and, of course, payments. We're expanding our open banking capabilities in Europe as well as we're now live with our Open Banking Connect solution with Lloyds Bank in the U.K. for consumers to make payments to their credit cards. 
We continue to see a great deal of interest and activity in digital currencies, and we're innovating in this space through new crypto and CBDC partnerships, enabling digital currencies on our network, and continuing our investments and underlying blockchain technology as part of our multi-rail strategy. 
We have several new crypto partnerships approved for launch this quarter, including a partnership with Gemini, a leading crypto platform here in the U.S., to launch a first of its kind cryptocurrency rewards credit card that allows consumers to receive crypto rewards on everyday purchases. 
And over in Spain, Crypton, a crypto exchange launching a Mastercard Crypto Card. On central bank digital currencies, we continue to engage with central banks around the world, and our virtual testing platform is helping them design features, similar issuance and evaluate interoperability with existing payment systems. In partnership with the Central Bank of Bahamas and Island Pay, we launched the world's first CBDC-linked payment card, enabling people to pay for goods and services using fiat currency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. 
Digital identity. Digital identity is critically important as the shift to a digital economy continues. It is a foundational component of our multilayered approach to security and have allowed us to help consumers and businesses safely and easily prove their identity while enabling them to main control over their information. 
Last week, we announced the planned acquisition of Ekata, which advances the digital identity efforts we have underway. Ekata has access to validated identity information on a global basis and leverages artificial intelligence to produce highly accurate identity scores. Ekata's insights support multiple payment and nonpayment use cases, including new account openings, instant issuance and transaction risk checks to be used by a broad range of customers, including leading digital merchants, financial institutions, travel companies and digital currency platforms. This is an example of how we are entering into adjacent areas and innovating beyond the core payment transaction. 
And now back to the bigger picture. We're leveraging our business to have a broader impact on society by executing our commitment to bring 1 billion people into the digital economy by 2025. Specifically on the environmental front, we have pledged to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050 and issued a sustainability bond in the last quarter to support these efforts. 
Furthermore, our Mastercard carbon calculator developed in collaboration with Doconomy, is enabled on our network to provide consumers with a snapshot of carbon emissions generated by their purchases. We've worked with customers to issue over 10 million cards using sustainable materials. If we tie all of this together, we are now linking executive comp to Mastercard's sustainability priorities.
With all of that in mind, I continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead, and I'm happy with the progress we're making against our objectives. And with that, Sachin, over to you."

Net r",1481,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everybody. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 2%, returning to positive growth for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in Q2 2020, and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. 
Operating expenses increased 7%, which includes a full ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was down 1%, and net income was down 6%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 5% year-over-year to $1.74, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $418 million through April 26, 2021. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing sequential improvement in both debit and credit as vaccination progress takes hold and mobility increases. 
In addition, debit growth is being further strengthened by fiscal stimulus and share gains. U.S. GDV increased by 14% with debit growth of 26% and a decline in credit of 1%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 5%, with debit growth of 12% and a decline in credit of 2%. 
Cross-border volume was down 17% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes down 11% and other cross-border volumes down 23%. 
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 9% in the first quarter globally. Card-not-present growth rates have accelerated during the past year and continue at those elevated levels, while card-present transactions are now growing above 2019 levels for the first time since the peak of the pandemic. 
In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are $2.8 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 2% was primarily driven by domestic transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by lower cross-border volume fees and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 8%, in line with worldwide GDV growth of 8%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 26%, while cross-border volumes decreased 17%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix, mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross border volumes. 
Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switch transactions were up 9%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily driven by adverse mix. Other revenues were up 27%, including a 3 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 4%. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 7%. This includes a [ OPDD ] increase from acquisitions and a 3 ppt increase related to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. Excluding these items, expenses were flat as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities while keeping an eye on top line growth. 
Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of April. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, primarily due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began mostly in March of last year. Hence, to provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at the spending levels as a percentage of 2019. For switched volumes, they have shown steady sequential improvement, continuing along the same trend line we saw in Q1. This is driven primarily by the U.S., which has benefited from the recent fiscal stimulus. We have seen improvements in discretionary categories like clothing, furniture and sporting goods. And we have also seen some recent strength in personal domestic travel in the U.S. and the U.K., which we are making strong progress in vaccinations. 
For instance, we have seen U.S. airline spend essentially doubled over the last 4 weeks relative to where it was earlier in Q1. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. 
In terms of cross border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 remained mostly unchanged through the start of April. We continue to see very strong growth in card-not-present cross-border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend. However, border restrictions remain widespread and to cross-border travel, which is card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes continues to be impacted. 
As you can see from the numbers, there's a significant opportunity for improvement in cross-border travel. In fact, where borders are open, such as Mexico, certain Latin American countries and the UAE, we have seen travel improve. 
Turning to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and feel we are very well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we have signed over the last several quarters. 
We have positioned ourselves for the return of travel, with travel-oriented portfolios and have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a healthy rate and has helped diversify our revenue base. In terms of the macro environment, domestic spending levels have continued to improve, entering the growth phase this quarter, supported in part by fiscal stimulus and the rollout of effective vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has been uneven, however. And as a result, we expect the pace of recovery to vary from country to country. 
As Michael said, we do believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel and are already seeing domestic travel improve. In terms of cross-border, we believe that in the second half of the year, we will see additional borders open, particularly between those countries with low infection rates and/or advanced vaccination programs. 
Turning to the second quarter. If spending levels continue on their current trajectory, we would expect Q2 net revenues to grow around a low- to mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. 
It is important to point out that this is just one potential scenario, which could be impacted by factors such as more restrictive measures being put in place because of rising infections, or the opening or closing of borders. In terms of operating expenses, we continue our disciplined expense management approach while furthering our strategic imperatives and keeping an eye on top line growth. As we progress through the growth phase of the pandemic domestically, we will look to increase our investments in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our multi-rail solutions, as well as begin to increase our advertising and marketing-related spend. 
For Q2, we expect operating expenses to grow at a rate in the low 20s versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are now beginning to lap the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic hit. 
With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have announced the planned acquisition of Ekata and have now closed on the transaction with Nets, and expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q2 and for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in the second quarter, and 8 to 9 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year, after which time, we do not split them up. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 2 to 3 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 3 to 4 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q2. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rate environment. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

And it is a continuation of what we have been doing in digital identity. So clearly, it's a non-sustainable path forward in a more digital economy to have even more passwords, so that's pretty clear. So identify is one pillar in our overall security strategy. So we needed to strengthen up here. The -- we started that activity with a pilot that we launched in Australia about a year ago, that is now going live in partnership with the Australian telecom, Optus, where we are introducing a reusable digital identity. What Ekata does is it accelerates our efforts, and accelerates our efforts because Ekata has access to verifiable data points that allow to establish an identity. As I said earlier, they can, in near real-time, produce very accurate identity scores. And it comes along with a set of -- established set of global customers, digital merchants, cryptocurrency chains, financial institutions and so forth. So we were on the track. Ekata is accelerating our efforts. It sits right into our existing set of cyber solutions. It's at the start of the transaction. It's at the end of the transaction. And in between, we have our decision intelligence, our various other transaction-focused solutions. So it's a full package. It sets us apart. And as you can appreciate, you linked this back to open banking, as you asked the question, we are going beyond the payment transaction and such. And you need identity solutions for data transaction just as much as you do for digital identity use cases."

I mean I know that on an organic constant currency basis, the second quarter OpEx is growing about in line with net revenue. So is that kind of the right general model to think about in the second half as well if the recovery progresses in line with your base case? Or does the second quarter have more catch-up OpEx spend in it?"

Look, I mean, rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially as domestic spending recovers and new and renewed deals come online. I think you're aware about the fact that our domestic volumes are more indexed -- our rebates and incentives are more indexed to domestic volumes. There are less indexed to cross-border. So depending on how that volume mix plays out, things might move around. But generally speaking, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up from current levels, pretty much the remainder of the year as volumes recover. 
On your second question around OpEx, look, as we look forward, we see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top line growth, and we will increase the investment we put forward towards our strategic priorities. And these are essentially the ones we've talked about growing our share of core payments, ensuring that digital experience for our customers, driving a broader set of services capabilities, executing on our digital strategy as well as our B2B strategy. 
As we do this, we will keep an eye on both the top line as well as the bottom line. And we will basically be very focused on making sure that we are making investments to drive the long-term growth of our business. And that's kind of the essential thing I'd like to leave you with, which is we will continue to stay disciplined from an expense management standpoint. We see domestic spending is transitioning towards the growth phase, which gives us confidence, and vaccines are effective and they're being deployed at scale. So we will keep an eye on all of those metrics, we will keep an eye on the top line, and we will look to invest in the business to drive that long-term growth objective that we're talking about."

I mean, that's the key question here. What makes a trend? What will stick? We have, over the last 14 months, on a monthly basis, helped consumers around the world, small businesses around the world. And the input that we're getting from this research remains unchanged. And that is fundamentally starting with increasing consumer confidence, spending is going up. And then when you look at the way how people spend, what we're hearing is when the pandemic subsides, 70% of people are saying, I'm going to continue to use more online commerce than I have before the pandemic. Almost 70% is saying the same thing for digital -- for digital banking. Almost the same number says more for contactless. 
And then you look at the other side of the coin, and that is about 60% of people are saying, I will actually use less cash. So we believe that these trends of elevated -- anything elevated online will prevail, maybe not at the same levels, but they will be elevated. At the same time, we're already seeing that in countries where strong vaccination programs are there and social distancing measures are reduced, that the spend in store is coming back. So people do want to go and spend at the local restaurant or support the local shop in their local main street. So the good thing is we're ready for both with our solutions. 
So that is around consumer behavior, the changing consumer as we turn out of this nightmare. And then you look at what else is going on. And what else are we seeing is with this push towards a more digital economy, we're seeing there's more data around. And the thirst for data analytics is increasing. Our services teams can't be running fast enough to satisfy that thirst. 
If you look at more data, you look at an increasing cyber footprint. So our cyber solutions, that is going to be -- it's going to be a continuing trend. Earlier, we talked a little bit about our multi-rail strategy and what we're doing there. I talked about Europe and being the local partner. Government is interested in -- payments government is interested in real-time payments and crypto central bank digital currency. So this whole trend of government leaning in, I think, is important. So our focus on our government vertical is going to help us there. 
And finally, just came across the news over the last couple of days, is the dependence on international supply chains is showing up. It shows up in the context of vaccine distributions lately, but it has been showing up across many different industries. So there is a real push to digitize supply chains, make them more flexible. And of course, that comes to payments as well and comes to associated data flows. So B2B should also be seeing quite a push out of -- as we turn out of the pandemic. So it's a shifting picture. And Darrin, I agree with you that there's a lot of things to feel positive about in terms of our strategy is on point for all these drivers. That's why we're increasing the investment behind these. And the second half of the question, I'll turn over to Sachin."

You can see how let's take something like cross-border, and cross-borders card-not-present, excluding travel, right? That, as been indexed back to 2019, is showing pretty healthy growth rates. Now as we come out of the pandemic, we expect a large part of that to stick. 
On the flip side, when you look what cross-border travel-related indexation looks like, in other words, 2021, current spend levels relative to 2019, they're running at about 40%. So if you believe that travel comes back, and we do believe that travel comes back, we see structurally the opportunity for upside growth coming from that as well. Just kind of bringing the whole picture together just to add to what Michael was saying. And kind of lends directly into your operating leverage question as well."

So i",626,"Lisa, it's a great question. Let's take a look at CBDCs. I mean across the whole crypto space, I mean where we want to play a role in CBDCs, we want to play a role in private stablecoins, we want to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets. So it's a broader space. Specifically in CBDCs, I would describe it as relatively early days. So the engagement that we have, and that's where we see our role to start with, is to answer the question that you just asked, in partnership with governments, is what is the right construct? What is the role of the private sector? And where we came out, and fortunately, as of late, there's been a few thought leadership pieces involving some of the leading central banks around the world, including the ECB and the Bank of England and so forth is, ideally, there's a 2-tier system where the government takes the role of mining the currency, so to say, as they do in fiat, and the private sector takes the role of distributing it. And the private sector, this comes to your question about the specific role that players could have, including us, is innovating around that. Innovating the true power of blockchain, what else could it do other than facilitating a payment. 
So I think there is -- there's a direction that we like where this is going. So concepts of interoperability are also very important because the utility for a consumer or business will only come when you can do something with the central bank digital currency. I think this example out of Bahamas is actually a very striking one. So here is a Mastercard partner program that allows you to spend on a CBDC unit that you have received at any place Mastercard is accepted. That's solving the last mile issue. Imagine how we could be doing this in so many countries. 
So is that engagement on model? Is that engagement on policy? Now as you try to do something like the Bahamas did, you've got to test it and try it. And for now that we see our second role, in actually facilitating a real-life test bed, where you can iterate around the design and see how does this work. And that's not only for governments. Governments like that, Sandbox, they engage, but it's also to pull in the commercial banks because it needs to go in conjunction if you have a 2-tier system. 
So I see all of that, and then I'll come to assume a scenario where this is in play, and it exists in a given country. We just talked about the Bahamas. There's this last mile issue. But there's also been the questions of what other applications can ride on this infrastructure. And you've heard us talk about in the context of real-time payments, our go-to-market is always underlying infrastructure, application services, and we intend to do the same thing here. And that is what is an application that could ride on top of this? It could be a smart trade contract. So a smart contract technology is what we're investing in, when I made the reference earlier, reinvesting in further blockchain technology. 
And then, of course, there are services. Everybody right now is asking us what should our blockchain strategy, and our advisors team is all over that. And there will be cyber questions. Governments are raising the question, when a blockchain comes along, is that a backdoor for hackers? So our whole cyber solution space is also geared up to engage. So I think there's a role to play for the private sector and there's a role to play very specifically for us to help the private sector and government."

Or is it a highly dispersed set of corridors that you've got around the world that will take a lot of them coming back online."

So when you think about, first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe.

So when you think about, first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe. You could see, generally speaking, intra-Europe constitutes a fairly significant portion of our cross-border volumes. And you can see that from the metrics, which we've been sharing with you. And so that will depend upon how travel opens up within the intra-Europe border, as kind of point one. Now but we recognize also that intra-Europe is lower-yielding than the other cross-border volume. So and as you think about it, you should think about it in that context. 
Secondly, what I'd tell you is U.S. is an important outbound corridor, there's no question about that. But there are several corridors well beyond that. When I think about the Middle East and Africa, when I think about what's going on in Asia Pacific, these are all important corridors. Take U.S. to Canada, another important corridor. U.S. to Latin America and Mexico these are all important corridors. I think the operative thing here is at least what we are spending a lot of time thinking about is not only about the rollout of vaccines, but what are governments doing to establish travel bubbles. So you've heard about Australia and New Zealand. You're hearing about Hong Kong, Singapore. You're hearing about China establishing some sort of bubble. So there's a lot of work which is currently underway in terms of seeing, is there a level of comfort to open up borders and to make it less onerous for people to travel. So it's kind of a 3-prong thing as far as I'm concerned: it's vaccines; it's the opening up and establishing of border kind of protocol; and then the third is, have you made it less onerous for people travel. And you've got to look at all those 3 as you think about how cross-border travel comes back. 
Now the proof points we've got so far are in corridors like U.S., Latin America, things have worked out pretty nicely. It's not that onerous. People are traveling. You've seen decent cross-border spend. Similarly, in the UAE, you've seen decent cross-border spend. A lot of this -- and one more reminder, a quick one I've got for you is, a lot of our cross-border travel volume is personal travel, and we do expect personal travel will come back. And the leading indicator for that is we've seen it come back in the domestic environment pretty robustly. Now that you've taken away these quarantine requirements in the context with the U.S. and several other countries. So that's the kind of color I just wanted to share with you as you think about how this will play out going forward."

What we've also experienced is that the dollar spent are not kind of once and done. So said differently, people are saving. And then there is the trickle effect, which comes to over a period of time. 
So it's our expectation that the impact of the stimulus will continue to be felt but at a declining pace as time goes along because we've started to see a lot of that come through in the early part right now. As I kind of just mentioned, you can see that in the strength in the numbers we've got. 
And then on your question on services, solid quarter on services again. Look, services continues to do really well. It does well from a revenue-generating capability. It also powers the core very effectively. You can see that in the way we're winning share. And I'm seeing a very strong pipeline in terms of what we're seeing from a services standpoint, going forward. So I feel pretty good. And the way, again, I think about this is you have a set of existing capabilities. How do you deepen your penetration with your customer base, existing and new customers, and then you keep building on your services capabilities. For example, the acquisitions we've recently done and how did we contribute to growth on a going-forward basis. So I think when you add all of that up, I feel pretty good about our services growth trajectory going forward."

Now that you've had it for a couple of months, it was, I guess, a little different than what you originally agreed to buy.

6477196,710740704,2263705,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Yes. So the first thing I would say, it's not entirely different from what we intended to buy. It's certainly different in terms of the expected time line. So it should have been a little faster than it was. Now but that aside, we were excited in August 2",593,"Yes. So the first thing I would say, it's not entirely different from what we intended to buy. It's certainly different in terms of the expected time line. So it should have been a little faster than it was. Now but that aside, we were excited in August 2019, and we're excited on March 3 when we had Legal Day One, and we welcomed the team in Copenhagen. And I'll tell you why we're excited. So with our existing set of multi-rail capabilities, particularly in the account-to-account space, we're well positioned with Vocalink. Vocalink has strong infrastructure capabilities, applications and helped us to build the services business. What Nets does is, Nets gives us additional infrastructure capabilities because here's a significantly customizable high-end solution that Vocalink brings, which works for large established markets that have had some journey in real-time payments. And then there's Nets, which is a more nimble platform that allows us to deal with the smaller markets and take on more in a shorter period of time. So there's complementary assets here and that if you look across that, it makes us the one-stop shop partner when it comes to real-time payments, and that is unsurpassed. There's nothing else out there at this point in time. 
On the application side, I'm even more excited because here, what we're having is -- we're not just getting technological capability with this purchase and we can bolt on to what we've already done in Vocalink. But we're getting scaled businesses that are live in market. There are strong bill payment propositions and volumes with large customer reach in, particularly in the Nordics regions, but other parts of Europe as well. So we've identified Bill Pay as a growth opportunity sometime back here in the U.S., and now we're bolting that on. And then we have the choice of taking some of our U.S. capabilities into other parts of the world or do the same with Nets. So that is accelerating our growth in the application space, which I'm particularly focused on. 
I think last but not least, that they have activities in the open banking space and few services around real-time payments. So that just rounds off the picture. And I come back to Legal Day One. We're getting a fantastic team of engineers and experts in this space that is just really rounding off of our capability side. Now the aspect on how this might look different. So Tien-Tsin, you made that reference. And I all want to remind us, there was a remedy that we had put on the table in kind of negotiations with the EU commission throughout the approval process. And it basically means we will license the Nets infrastructure technology to a licensee, and the licensee was identified as part of the approval process. That allows -- but that is on the infrastructure side, not much of an issue because we have other assets to compete and then we can use it ourselves. So we're not excluded here. The package of having infrastructure application and service altogether, I think, makes such a differentiated proposition that we were quite happy to give that remedy. It made the EU commission happy. And it comes back to the point about -- yes, this is particularly important in Europe because in Europe, being seen as a true European partner, we have the commission put a stamp of approval on this transaction, and that works well for us. But we're going to take it elsewhere, for sure. I mean, that's the whole plan."

Throughout the last quarter calls, we make references to engagements on the government front and, oftentimes, that involve our progress and our engagement with governments on account-to-account. And there are other things, obviously, that we had to dial down throughout the pandemic because there simply was no appetite in the market, but account-to-account wasn't one of them. We never missed a single step there and neither did government. 
This was really driven by a lot of governments trying to get stimulus money into their citizens' hands, and they couldn't do it fast enough, and they couldn't do it in an efficient-enough way. So the focus and the light shed on real-time payment infrastructure was -- certainly helped. So I would see, there is an increasing engagement around account-to-account. Throughout the pandemic, if you look at what else was going on, you saw the 2-factor authentication thing in Europe for -- strong customer authentication, I think, is the actual technical term there. That moved forward throughout the pandemic. So the government, the financial sector players in Europe advanced that, and that was broadly it. And then you look at what we've done with open banking. I mentioned it earlier. That's, again, a regulator-driven aspect of payments and the broader financial services here at Tesco. We talked about that last quarter, I think, in our Lloyd's. So there is momentum. I think it's actually literally a shot in the arm rather than anything else. Sachin, do you have anything to add?"

And it moves around -- there's a whole bunch of stuff, which is kind of going on in there. Because remember, in the denominator, when you're doing yield calculations, we talk about GDV. I think the natural instinct is to think about GDV only as domestic volumes. It's a composition of domestic and cross-border volumes. Whereas the numerator, which is domestic assessments, is only the revenue we own on our domestic volumes. 
So depending on how that mix moves around, you're going to see that yield move around as well. And then there are other moving parts in domestic assessments, the card fees and those kind of things, which are actually featured in there as well. But by and large, I would tell you, between the fourth quarter of 2019 going into the first quarter of 2021, our yields have held pretty steady if I take those 2 endpoints. They bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but they're now pretty steady."

So throughout the pandemic, as you rightly said, there was clearly a relative rise in debit over credit transactions. The way I look at this is, this is a time of economic uncertainty, frankly, uncertainty general. And in those times, people generally prefer to spend money they have and have more control over that. So that is what we've seen in previous crises, so no surprise there, that is crisis-induced. We see debit benefit from stimulus payments because they are attached to a bank account. So we saw that. 
And then you look at how the mix of spending has changed in terms of overweight to everyday spend versus discretionary spend, and that is just -- there's a lot of historical consumer behavior ingrained in that, is that you use debit for more everyday spend. That is what we're seeing in many markets around the world, and that has played out here as well. So now the question is, what of that is going to stick back to what we said earlier in terms of trends? And in the end, that's hard to predict. I do think what we're going to see is that the crisis in use spend is -- the trigger there is going to go away because this nightmare will be over at some point, hopefully, soon. And you will also see that the discretionary spend categories are coming back. We're already seeing this in the last 3 weeks when I look at the first 3 weeks of April here. So you start to see travel, strong travel programs. And it's very, I think, reasonable to expect that a lot of that is going to drive credit growth back up. 
So we're going to see a bit of a balancing. Now, for us, I think the strategy has to be, we have to have the best solutions across debit and credit, and frankly, beyond cards as well because we just talked about earlier how the overall payment landscape is changing. And that's where the focus is. That's why we lean in on the travel side, but that's also why we lean in on debit. And you're right, NatWest, Deutsche, Santander, it's in conversion right now, as I said earlier, and that's going to be good for us, and we try to bring our best solutions forward with consumers.

The point I'd make, Craig, in addition is, obviously, the increased secular shift which is taking place. I think you were alluding to the fact that the first point of replacement of cash happens to be debit. We're certainly seeing that come through. But like Michael said, there will be some level of reversion to the mean. 
The one point I'd make is, the way we look at it, even from a product life cycle standpoint, is people tend to start, when you think about financial inclusion and you think about how people come into spending in electronic forms, they start with prepaid, then move to debit, then they start getting their toe into credit. And that's just the natural evolution, which will take place. We want to have a balanced portfolio. We want to win across the board, and we want to be ready to actually address those spend as they come across debit and/or credit."

So here are highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutra",1867,"Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are highlights of the quarter. 
The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On a same basis, quarter 2 net revenues are now 10% over 2019 levels, even though international travel is in the early stages of recovery, which is showing the strength of our diversified revenue streams. 
The switch volumes are well above pre-pandemic levels with all the regions growing in a healthy rate. We're seeing improvements in both domestic and cross-border travel with significant upside potential. Within this context, we're making progress against our strategic objectives and have expanded our relationships with key partners Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Stripe and Verizon. 
[indiscernible] looking first at the broader economy. Domestic spending levels continue to show improved in-store sales and strength in e-commerce. According to our quarter 2 spending report, which is based on all payment types, including connection checks, U.S. retail sales at auto ex gas were up 14% versus a year ago and up 10% versus 2019, reflecting improved consumer mobility and the residual effects of fiscal stimulus. Spending [indiscernible] also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter 2 were up 13% versus a year ago and 6% versus 2019. 
The vaccine rollout of scale in the U.S., U.K. and Germany and several other countries with over 35 countries now reporting that over 50% of their population are partially vaccinated. Broadening this effort is critical and, of course, takes time. 
Turning to our business, specifically in the 4-phased framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. We believe that most markets as a growth phase domestically as cross-border spend is now starting to normalize restrictions are being relaxed. 
Looking at Mastercard spending trends. List volumes continued to improve quarter-over-quarter, with strength across all products. Debit spend remains elevated, and we are seeing further recovery in credit driven in part by the return of travel and increased discretionary spending. This recovery is led by consumer credit, but it's important to note that commercial credit is also improving and has now reached pre-pandemic levels themselves. In terms of how people are spending, we are definitely getting out more as we're seeing improvement in card-present spending, particularly in the travel, retail and restaurant categories. Multiple e-commerce continues to be strong. 
Now turning to cross-border. Proforma card-not-present spending, excluding our line travel spending continues to be very strong. On the travel front itself, it's clear people want to travel and they do so where and when able to. We've seen this domestically and across borders where there are limited transact restrictions. For example, we're seeing strength between the U.S. and Latin America as well as an increase in travel within Europe. Our industry reports, there has been a recent increase in bookings for travel between the U.S. and Europe, and the quarantine declines for entry into Canada are starting to be relaxed, so that's a further opportunity. Overall, we expect more borders to open in the second half of the year, depending, of course, on infection rates, including the recent variants and progress on the vaccination [indiscernible]. 
Against this improving backdrop and focusing on our strategic priorities: one, [indiscernible] core products supported by our services; second, driving digital enablement, both in stores and online; third, ensuring the ecosystem is safe and secure; and fourth, providing choice through our multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye at driving top and bottom line growth over the long term by continuing to manage our expenses carefully. 
We'll look at them one by one. First off, we're driving growth in our core products and leveraging our corporate enhancement services to do so, working with new and existing customers solve their pain points, both in payments and beyond. We're well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel. We remain focused on building and strengthening this area by expanding relationships with our travel partners. 
For example, we have renewed our exclusive co-brand with Jetblue Airlines in the U.S. We also added into a long-term global partnership with Cathay Pacific and Asia Miles, who will migrate their existing co-brand portfolio to Mastercard.  we've expanded our British Airways co-brand and in Latin America, the now the preferred brand for LatAm airlines. It is important to note that our services played a critical role in deeming all these deals, including our data analytics, loyalty, consulting and cybersecurity solutions. 
Of course, we also continue to drive growth in the core outside of travel. Here are a few examples. We're excited about our partnership with Citi to launch a new Citi Custom Cash Mastercard, offering card members cash back in the top eligible spend category. JPMorgan Chase, we've extended and deepened our agreement in the commercial space, and we have reviewed our master brand relationship with Chase in the U.S. 
We also continue to partner closely with community banks throughout the U.S., including a flip of first turn National Bank's debit portfolio to become their exclusive network brand. 
On the digital front, we're well positioned to drive the acceleration of the secular shift with our digital capabilities no matter how consumers want to shop: in store, online or both. As consumers return to in-person shopping, adoption of contactless continues to grow. The second quarter, contactless penetration represented 45% of in-person purchase transactions globally according to our switch transaction. That's up from 37% a year ago. At the same time, e-commerce continues its strong growth, and we are providing consumers choice on high how they want to pay online. Example click to pay, to improve the guest checkout experience, it's now rolled out in over 10 markets, and we continue to launch significant new merchants such as the Canadian Tire Group. 
On to the final space in Australia, we're partnering with Citi and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to offer installments to consumers wherever Mastercard is accepted. And whether in store or online, we are securing and streamlining the consumer experience through our tokenization services. Tokenized transactions across in-store, online and in apps surpassed 1 billion per month throughout the second quarter. 
We continue to partner with major digital players to expand the reach of our digital capabilities. For example, we just entered a strategic partnership with Stripe to get business in small control of the holiday spend their money by enabling Stripe users to create, manage and distribute virtual physical cards for small business, commercial and consumer across printed, debit and prepaid. 
We also entered a partnership with the rig to bring 5G innovation to the global payments industry. Everything has served our services and insights pairing Mastercard solution with Verizon's 5G connectivity will allow us to create better experiences from the checkout lines being built even though how businesses are run. The increased capacity and reduced latency of 5G will enable us to take another step toward making every device that comes to us. 
Now on to securing an ecosystem. As more merchants and consumers shift to digital, the importance of keeping the ecosystem safe and secure is paramount and is creating a strong demand for our cyber solutions. In addition to organic growth, a number of our acquisitions in the space continue to perform well. 
For example, Ekata had strong deal momentum, including a fraud and dispute management agreement with key banks, a payment solution provider operating across 15 countries in Latin America.  [indiscernible], which monitors and census customers third-party cybersecurity risk is now scanning millions of companies globally, up from thousands to be acquired them at the end of 2019.  [indiscernible] is providing biometric prevention tools, Major League Baseball and a new bank [indiscernible]. We're happy to advance our digital identity capability with the acquisition of Ekata now closed and off to a strong start on the deal front. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to our initiatives focused on addressing a broader set of payment flows with our capabilities. 
The key here is to provide choice, essentially the right tool for the job. With our multi-rail approach, including our expertise and capabilities in cards, real-time payments and support for digital currencies are able to deploy the right combination of assets to meet our customers' needs. And more than just having this range of capabilities, we're making the solutions work together. Let me give you a few examples. 
In B2B, we're making progress with Mastercard Track building out our global open-loop network by working with buyer agents and supplier agents, such as bank software companies and ERP vendors. On the bank side, We're very excited to have signed boxy card payments with to connect their global business customers on both the buyer and the supplier side of the ecosystem across multiple rails. 
We also signed Freshworks, a premier accounting software platform with customers in over 100 countries. 
[indiscernible], we continue to scale that Mastercard billexchange, which leverages our real-time payment capabilities provide a transformative mobile-first experience to bill payments with City Treasury and Trade Solutions now connecting into the platform. 
[indiscernible], we continue to penetrate a variety of repayment flows beyond traditional card payments. These enabled dozens of use cases and hundreds of programs across every region of the world. For example, we're partnering with innovative digital messaging platforms to offer P2P services to consumers. Today, uses of in Brazil can transfer money directly in-app as leveraging Mastercard spend. We're also partnering with MoneyGram and checkout to enable near real-time cross-border PV transfers across Europe. And on the B2C front, we continue to support the fast-growing gig economy, and I'm partnering with Payfair to enable instant earnings payout or some of the largest gig platforms in the U.S. 
Through open banking, Mastercard is empowering people and businesses across the globe to easily and securely gain access to their financial data to create import opportunities for themselves. 
In the U.S., Our efforts with Finicity are running ahead of expectations as we continue to enhance direct API connectivity for banks and fintechs. For example, we're partnering with Jack Henry to enable consumers back on more than 400 community financial institutions to use its digital platform to access, use and benefit from their own financial data. The Navy Federal Credit team, we will be signed direct data access agreements with Finicity. Finicity is also testing data connections to launch new products and new verticals, such as its mortgage verification service. 
Finally, in terms of cryptocurrency, we're making it easier for cryptocurrency wallets to connect seamlessly to our network through a pilot with Circle and Evolve Bank & Trust, which simplifies the conversion of crypto into [indiscernible] Separately, we're partnering with consensus, the ECR software engineering firm, to accelerate the development of crypto applications and services to our customers. 
Now summing all this up, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, benefiting from our revenue diversification efforts. We believe that most markets are in the growth phase domestically and there's upside potential in cross-border travel. We're winning significant new deals, and we continue to focus on our strategic priorities to drive growth over the long term. 
Sachin, over to you."

Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. 
Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and strong recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34%, and net income was up 36%, both of which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. 
EPS was up 37% year-over-year to $1.95, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $1.7 billion worth of stock and an additional $398 million through July 26, 2021. 
So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 33% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 24% with EBIT growth of 23% and credit growth of 50%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased with debit growth of 39% and a credit growth of 25%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter with volumes up 48% and other cross-border volumes up 71%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the depths of the pandemic last year. In the second quarter, cross-border volume was 87% of 2019 levels, with almost back to even at 97% and other [indiscernible] of 2019 levels. 
In the second quarter, cross-border volumes [indiscernible] rates remained strong, and card-present growth continued to improve, aided by increases in contactless penetration across every region. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 31% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher regiment incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 36%, while worldwide GDV growth was up 33%. The 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing and mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 60%, while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as cross-border volumes ex intra-Europe  grew faster than intra-Europe volumes this quarter, partially offset by the lapping of elevated levels of return activity a year ago. 
Transaction processing fees were up 33%, while switch transactions were up 41%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily driven by the lapping of elevated return activity a year ago and adequate mix. 
Other revenues were up 32%, including 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. 
Finally, rebates and incentives were up 49%, reflecting the strong growth in volume and transactions and new and renewal deal activity. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. 
Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part due to the lagging effects related to the pandemic that began last year. 
To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to once again present the 2021 volumes and transactions and the percentage of the 2019 amount when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, the broad-based recovery continued through the second quarter and into July. Specifically, in the first 3 weeks of July, switched volume spend levels are at 130% of 2019 levels, which is a 9 ppt improvement over Q1. We are seeing a further recovery in card-present spending with improvements in travel-related categories, including lodging and restaurants. Of those, in the U.S., we have seen consumer airline spend improved significantly since the early part of Q2, with volumes now back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing a switch volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 show an improving travel trend. Cross-border travel, which includes both card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes increased from 39% to 66% of 2019 levels from April to July, primarily driven by strength in Europe and between the U.S. and Latin America. Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. 
Cross-border card-not-present ex travel  should grow at a healthy rate above pre-pandemic levels. This has moderated recently relative to 2019 levels in part due to a reduced contribution from the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the lapping of significant e-com promotional activity in 2019. 
Turning now to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and are well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we continue to sign. Domestic spending levels are growing healthy growth, and we are well positioned for the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. Further, our service lines continue to grow at a healthy rate. 
Turning to the third quarter. The spending levels continue to improve along their current trajectory. We would expect Q3 net revenues to grow at the high end of mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, 2020 marked the low point of the pandemic from a spending standpoint with some recovery in the following quarter. So we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 3 ppt in the third quarter. 
It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to new profit variance and the progress of vaccinations and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. 
In terms of operating expenses, we will continue our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our strategic objectives in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and another solutions, including related brand and product marketing investments. 
For Q3, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of mid-teens rate versus the year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are lapping the spending and actions we took last year as the pandemic developed. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have closed on the transaction with Ekata earlier than expected and expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in both Q3 and Q4 as we integrate several acquisitions in promising new growth areas such as open banking, digital identity and real-time payments. As a reminder, we discretely disclose the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year, after which time we do not split them out. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 1 to 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q3. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. 
And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business and improvement over previous expectation due to some discrete tax benefits realized in Q2. 
One last point, I wanted to let you know that we are planning an investment community meeting for the fall in New York. We are planning a event on November 10, and we look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

So Tien-Tsin, it's like I said in my comments, I think what we have line of sight on is the acquisitions which we have done, which we have announced, and that's what I've given you some level of guidance on as it relates to what contribution they're going to have from a revenue standpoint and an expense standpoint, all of which I just went through in my prepared remarks. 
Look, the reality is we're running the business for the long term. We're trying to drive long-term revenue growth and at the same time, long-term bottom line growth. And we'll do this in a disciplined manner. We have demonstrated over the period of the pandemic that we have sufficient flexibility in our expense base to actually make sure that we continue to execute on our strategic good objectives and at the same time, keep an eye on how we're seeing the top line come around. 
So I guess my point to you is the following, which is -- We will continue to do what's right for the business to drive long-term growth by investing in key strategic areas, both organic and inorganic. And that's kind of where we are. In terms of the specifics on the numbers, it's what I just shared with you, we expect that acquisitions will contribute between 2 and 3 points to revenue in the third and the fourth quarter and between 9 and 10 points of expense growth in the third and the fourth quarter."

We stick to our 24-month nondilutive measure on all of these. So I just want to put that out there with you as well."

Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here,",616,"Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question. Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here, which is Central Bank digital currencies and there's private sector stable coins and there is a floating cryptos. 
So we told you that we want to be playing a role across all of them. We also said in the first quarter call that as far as stable coins are concerned, we are getting ready to technologically enable our network to carry these stable coins of settlement currency provided they meet one of our -- all 3 of our criteria, which is regulatory compliance, consumer protection and stability. So none of that has changed. 
Let me just give you a view on what has happened since we had that conversation. So on the Central Bank digital currency front, things are definitely continuing to move forward. You see a lot of central banks engaged on a topic. The ECB has just recently announced that they will actually move forward with the digital euro after a period of industry consultation. 
The Bank of England is in a period of industry engagement at this point right now. So there is clear progress. What is our value proposition to central banks and government in this space is, first of all, we bring a unique perspective to the market as to these players as multi-rail provider because all these countries have to make the trade-off, what is my existing financial system delivering my financial infrastructure and what else is the central bank digital currency solving for. Everybody has different motivations ranging from financial inclusion to cross-border payments and hence, we're a sought after party because we have experience in all of that. 
I think a particularly critical proposition here is our virtual test platform because all of these design choices that governments have to make and that we consult them on, we then have to live in the wild, so to say. They've got to work with the existing financial infrastructure, and that's what our virtual test platform does for them. So that's the proposition at this stage for central banks. 
On the private sector, stable coins, nothing much different other than us engaging with private sector players as well as regulators on what does good policy look like around private sector stable coins because this question about regular compliance is still unresolved. The regulators do need to weigh in, and we're a part of that dialogue. 
On floating cryptos, here, the point of currency stability is not solved. So we won't be enabling that as settlement currency on our network.  But clearly, people want to invest in that. They don't want to sell their investments, and we're going to make this as easy as possible. So we have all these partnerships out there. 
Now here's the thing with our announcement last week. And that is that in digital currency wallets out there oftentimes prefer to stay in crypto as these transactions are selling and buying of investment. And here's where our partnerships, for example, with Paxos come in, it is our partner that allows these digital wallet to stay in crypto as they settle with Paxos with us in Fiat. That's an interim step for us as and when, when we reach the point that we might be enabling stable coins on our network itself. 
So that's kind of where we are, playing a role across the board. This is a relevant technology. As a multi-rail player, we got to be in the space because people are looking for answers."

So the first thing I should say is our commercial business is there. It's coming back. Commercial travel is coming back, as I noted earlier in my comments. So here the focus is on small business, virtual card. And in the B2B space, specifically virtual card solutions, for example, on online travel agencies. So all that is continuing, but it's worth noting, we gave you a number some time back and in [ Q2 ] 2020, this was 11% of our GDV and that is what we're happy about that. 
Now when it comes to B2B very specifically, the multifaceted approach I talked you through earlier across bill pay, track and the whole list that I talked about. Here, I see that if I take Bill Pay today, if you look at the fact that we have a quarter of all bills being paid addressable and 1/3 of the billers, so that gives us real scale. So I think we have come to a point of scalability here with the right kind of players. 
Last quarter, we added Verizon as a biller to the mix. So that is encouraging. We haven't given specific numbers, and we haven't done it this quarter yet, but we really see that's going in the right direction. 
And with Nets coming in, we have a significant footprint in Europe. They run a scaled bill pay business over there. So when the time is right, we will share some numbers around that. 
Now as B2B, specifically Track, the excitement around a large bank like Barclays joining the track ecosystem is great. We fine-tuned our go-to-market with ERP and software providers. So the rollout here is progressing well with the right -- with both sides, buyers supplier and buyer and supplier agents. Again, we haven't given numbers yet, but it would be what you would expect when you build a 2-side network. We're starting to have players on both sides. We can start to connect the corridors. So the value proposition of Track, data switch, a payment optimization engine and the choice in multi-rail payments is really starting to get a hold. We said to you a couple of times, this has been -- this is going to be a multi-rail journey. 
COVID, while there was a realization that B2B supply chains have been affected by COVID, and there's a desire to digitize, it wasn't exactly top-of-mind through COVID. So we're starting to see this interest coming back. 
So that's kind of where we are. And Sachin, you have anything to add?"

What is the micro kind of business environment, small business environment, mid-market and then large corporates? And when you actually dissect along those lines, you will see that there's a significant amount of spend which takes place across the micro and small business space. And if you further break that down, you will see that there is a significant amount of that spend which takes place in cash. 
So the only point I'm kind of trying to make is that the value prop of the card rails in B2B still stands and stands pretty strong to displace cash, much like it has in the consumer space. And there's a tremendous opportunity for digitalization to continue down that path there as well. 
So I know we talk a lot about the accounts payable flow, and I think that's super important, but we certainly internally are not losing sight of the fact that a significant amount of cash spend, which still takes place where the value prop of card stands good."

So let me take the last one with kind of like a bit of a cheeky response. I think you will just have to tune in, Craig, to find out if we're going to give a 3-year guidance or longer-term guidance at the time. 
On interchange, so call that topic for sure. And the new administration is looking at various regulatory and lawmaking initiatives, as we all know. We've just seen news develop yesterday. Now from the outset, we've leaned in with the new administration. We built a really positive relationship. So that is very good. And we're continuing, obviously, the same kind of interaction and engagement on a topic as important as interchange to our industry with lawmakers on the Hill House and Senate, both sides of the aisle. 
We're monitoring this very closely. There is chatter here and there on interchange. The topic that's always been focused by different parties. What I would say is we've had the benefit of now having many years of playing -- seeing the interchange regulation on debit play out. There's enough data for us out there to say that really what it was intended to do, we can't really see it. Cost for consumers have gone up, and benefits have been reduced. We keep providing that data to lawmakers and other interested parties and figures what the facts are stating. Now when it comes to interchange regulation applies to credit, you would expect the same in terms of cost impact in terms of benefits impact, but there is another aspect here, that is the access to credit. You should assume that the access to credit for middle-class Americans is going to be impacted and not in a positive way if this interchange regulation comes in. So it is all something that needs to be thought through very carefully. 
What are the puts and takes? Why does this make sense? And that's the dialogue we're leaning in. The good thing is we've seen this play out in many other markets around the world and have some experience with that and can that bring to the table as well.

And I think, Sachin, you mentioned in your third quarter view, you expect continued spending trends. Is there a view on cross-border as well?"

So really, I will preface by saying the following, which is, again, it's the uncertainty in the environment prevails given all these variants, which are kind of showing up. But the reality is the following, which is has been clearly demonstrated that people want to travel and they do so when they're able to travel. And that's been shown in the domestic environment, and that's being now shown in the cross-border environment. 
So one of the things which is something which we very closely track is how is it that booking levels are taking place? What's kind of that trajectory of spend looking like or that trajectory of kind of data looking like? And then which are the corridors, which are opening up based on -- for example, earlier this week, there was some dialogue around how the U.K. is going to open up to vaccinated people coming from the U.S. and from other countries. 
So the reality is the following, which is the data as we've seen it is what we've shared with you through the first 3 weeks of July. We are positive in terms of our sentiment as we progress through the second half of the year that as people get more vaccinated, more corridors will open up. As more corridors open up, people will exercise their ability to travel because they have the intent to travel. And this is really, really important because as I look at what's going on across the globe, you can see that the U.S. and Latin America, which has the ability to travel with more borders being open, people are exercising that and they're showing that come through. 
Similarly, now we're hearing about Canada opening up, which will be, again, something, which is encouraging from our perspective in terms of how people play that out. 
Asia, on the other hand, is still, I would say, at a pretty kind of subdued levels just because of the reality of the situation in Asia, being what it is with the variants now actually getting to higher levels in certain countries in Asia. So look, hard to predict. But longer term, I guess, when I kind of look through all of this, what we feel encouraged about is that the vibrancy of travel is something which will come back. And most importantly, we are very well positioned to capitalize on that when it does come back."

As what we've seen with Canada and the U.K., there's a whole stack of people that are vaccinated on and travel. And until you come to the point of wells is not vaccinated, there's a long runway for us for -- this to play out. But as Sachin said, very difficult to predict at this point, but those are facts that are on the table at least that we're looking at, and we've seen that over the last 3 weeks."

So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time is going to level out. I think you're right. Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that. But there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly o",622,"Yes. So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time is going to level out. I think you're right. Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that. But there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly on commercial travel. We'll see how that will play out. 
It's interesting. When you look over the last 2 quarters, we see continued elevated levels of digital e-commerce spend, but we see in-store coming back. So there is not a net zero game going on. I think this is actually really generally secular trend against cash, that is going to continue to run for a very long time. So it's good to have these 2 legs to stand on from our business model. I think that will remain. 
You'll see some of the e-commerce going to reduce over time, but I don't think we will go back to the levels that we had before the pandemic because people would have learned better experiences, and they will like continue with that. I think every bit of consumer research that we do tells us that. And by the way, this is not just for online shopping or digital -- or digital banking. It's for contactless. It's for everything across the board. Generally, between 60% and 70% of people that we ask, and we ask them every month, say exactly that. 
With this push towards a more digital world, more data, more data that needs to be kept safe, so I see that the path for our cybersecurity solutions is a very clear one and a very good one, and we will not see a reversion to something there before because you have the elevated driver of more digital just out there driving that business. And frankly, that's the same for data and analytics. 
Data analytics, again, more data, people want to understand it. But back to what Sachin was talking about on small business, here's a bunch of players that have traditionally maybe not used tools like that, understanding and managing their business through data and analytics. But now they can. So there's a whole new segment that's opening up that will -- we would like to serve to our partners in terms of real insights in how do you run a business online from whatever you might have been doing in the brick-and-mortar before. So I think those are structural changes that are here to last. 
Cross-border, I don't think it's going to be something dramatically structural changing. That's really -- well, cross-border e-commerce, I think that is that, again, people would have figured out that this does actually work. It couldn't go anywhere. They were using cross-border e-commerce platforms and tools, and I think that will continue. 
One more thing that comes to mind structurally is the heightened and elevated interest of governments and electronic payments and digital payments. That has started last year. Again, that was driven by the prices initially. How do I get my stimulus payments out to now a conversation, wow, this is an interesting space and I found that my infrastructure stated. I need to partner with people. 
So that is something that I see fundamentally as an opportunity, but it's important to engage with government as a fair partner and see that local footprint and things like that do matter that is -- we are well positioned with our multi-rail infrastructure to do exactly that. 
So there's a few things that come to mind. Back to Lisa's earlier question on B2B, I think this continued interest in digitizing B2B supply chains and B2B payments that will also play out and grow over time over the next 2, 3 years."

The Stripe partnership, as you heard me say, this is really across the board, a true strategic partnership. So this enabling their customer set with basically every payment tool that is available in providing choice. That's in the end, what this is about. 
Verizon, an entirely different strategic partnership. But here's another network, but a 5G network. We said, what could we do back. We've talked about SME on this call in a couple of occasions now. Think about an SME today has a card terminal and how they're going to compete with the marketplace. This is a -- if you imagine for a moment, you have a full Internet connectivity with not much infrastructure that you need to bring in, and then you can provide a true omnichannel experience, even the smallest business can do that. That is what 5G can deliver at any endpoint anywhere at any situation. And that is the vision that Verizon, Hans and his team and our folks that we have developed. This is very specific. We've been on it for a while, and we're expecting to make a real difference there. 
So 2 different types of strategic partnerships. I think they both matter, come back to the point that it's -- for us, it's about providing choice and payments to and anyone out there that is transacting in payments."

So a couple of things kind of to point out on that line item, really. At the end of the day, there are things which are, I would call, episodic, which took place in the months of April and June, and there's volatility in the price of crypto. There's more purchases, which took place there. And then as the price came down, then you had the inverse effect of that taking place. 
So the reality is that to us kind of is one of those things which will remain volatile. And I say that only because I don't know where the price is going to go and how people are going to exercise their choice to purchase crypto on a going-forward basis. What I will tell you is we've seen a decent level of deceleration take place in how people are utilizing Mastercard products to purchase these digital currencies like crypto over the last 3 weeks as reflected in the numbers. So that's kind of one of the factors which influenced that. 
The second being just a tougher comp where the timing of that e-com promotional activity which took place in 2019 happened to be in the first 3 weeks of July. So the comp is a tougher comp there. So that I don't view as something which is on a going-forward basis that will be impacting what the so-called index growth rate is for this line item, 2021 versus 2019. Suffice it to say the following, which is the trend towards digital continues. It's true in domestic. It's true in cross-border. And the fact that, that is a positive feel went back to what Michael just talked about in terms of structural changes is something we are well positioned to actually keep participating in as the economies evolve and things start to open up in different parts of the globe. So that's what I'd like to share with you on that one."

So on cross-border, Jason, you mentioned that you're aware about the fact that intra-Europe cross-border is low yielding than all other cross-border. And I think that's one thing to keep in mind because growth rates across those populations of spend will determine what revenue growth rate ultimately looks like. 
The reality is in the second quarter, we had a tougher comp from an elevated level of returns that we had seen in last year, which had the impact of doing our cross-border volume fee growth rate, some in this second quarter. And again, it's not like those returns and elevated revenues of returns only took place in the second quarter of last year. As the pandemic hit, people start to make cancellations in terms of their airline bookings, their hotel bookings, and that kind of -- while it tapered, it still occurred going into the third quarter as well. So just something to keep in mind as to what the puts and takes are when you're thinking about growth rates. 
On rebates and incentives, here's what I would tell you. I think you're very well aware about the focus of the company on making sure we are setting ourselves up to quickly to win market share, and winning market share comes through creating fantastic value propositions and then delivering them at great value to our customers, which is where the rebates and incentives come into play. 
So we continue to do that, and we will continue to do new and new deals, which will have an impact on rebates and incentives. So the one point -- the one piece of information I'll share with you is that as it relates to Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be generally in line with what we saw in Q2. That's the extent of what I'm going to share with you in terms of where I kind of see playing out. Obviously, the mix of volumes impact that line item as well."

Right. Thanks, Andrew. Great question. So if you look at our services portfolio to start with, we try to seek an entry point as the sweet spot, leveraging our footprint and payments and our data and then have the technological capabilities and the talent and all of that coming together to a differentiated proposition. So you'll really see us compete with other services player on a pure play that has nothing to do with our position in payments. So that's the starting point of our strategy. And we're looking for adjacencies that just leverage our core competencies. 
Now when it comes to the cyber solutions, if I think about a product like Decision Intelligence, which basically helps our customers to make -- decide what's a good decision and what is not a good decision, it is exactly at the sweet spot of everything that I said. It's the transaction data. It's the availability of having this in real time in our system available and then using state-of-the-art AI to make the decisions for our customers. 
So here, I think we have -- from a competitive landscape perspective, a real leg up versus pure plays. Similar in loyalty, we're one of the largest loyalty players in the world. They are pure plays, but the fact that we see all the transaction flow and we can look at aggregated anonymized data of look-alikes and what they are interested in and how their preferences go in terms of the warrants offers, manage programs and so forth, again, puts us in a differentiated proposition. 
You go but you see us building out our proposition in cyber coming back to that, looking at the whole value chain, decision intelligence about the transaction before the transaction, what we're now doing with the and saying it's the foundational element. So here we go in. Ekata in itself has a set of data that allows us in real time to help a customer -- one of our customers decide if this account opening request is a good one or a bad one. There's a very high confidence score. That customer is obviously then interested in working with us on the downstream through the whole value chain of the transaction and other cyber security solutions, all the way to fulfillment. But again say is that address actually a real address. So is this somebody that is just ordering something somebody else's name. 
So that's how we're thinking about it holistically and leveraging our footprint and payments."

We've been active in Europe for 3 years now -- 2 years now. We went live in summer 2019 over there. Good momentum. You heard us talk about Tesco and Lloyd's in the U.K. set up use cases that are now live. So happy about that. Good footprint over there. 
And in here in Finicity, that was a real kick for us closing that transaction in November last year. And the Finicity team, first of all, they're deep in permission API, the of the FDX standards. So they live and breathe open banking, and that was really critical for us as a player here in the U.S., great incumbent in the market. 
Now what is going better than expectations? I see a lot of momentum in engaging with banks. They have best-in-class data, data connections and had a best footprint in banks, but we're now that as everybody else is looking at that and connect with Finicity. But we also see progress on the SIM side because this is an ecosystem that works on both sides. 
So we're excited about that. They had an interesting set of solutions today that account account verification, credit decisioning assistance. And now with the mortgage verification service, we're starting to build out at the same time, although driving on the deal front, we're also expanding the product set by bringing our data together with their data and our tech and their tech.

Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach."

So here are highlights of the quarter.

So here are highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On that same basis, quarter 2 net revenues are now 10% over 2019 levels even though international travel is in the early stages of recovery, which is showing the strength of our diversified revenue streams.  
The domestic switched volumes are well above pre-pandemic levels with all the regions growing in a healthy rate. We're seeing improvements in both domestic and cross-border travel with significant upside potential. Within this context, we're making progress against our strategic objectives and have expanded our relationships with key partners like Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Stripe and Verizon.  
Let's dive in, looking first at the broader economy. Domestic spending levels continue to show improved in-store sales and strength in e-commerce. According to our quarter 2 SpendingPulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales at auto, ex gas, were up 14% versus a year ago and up 10% versus 2019, reflecting improved consumer mobility and some residual effects of fiscal stimulus. SpendingPulse also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter 2 were up 13% versus a year ago and 6% versus 2019.  
The vaccine rollout has scaled in the U.S., U.K. and Germany and several other countries with over 35 countries now reporting that over 50% of their populations are at least partially vaccinated. Broadening this effort is critical and will of course take time.  
Turning to our business, specifically in the 4-phased framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. We believe that most markets are at a growth phase domestically as cross-border spend is now starting to normalize and border restrictions are being relaxed.  
Looking at Mastercard spending trends. Switched volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter, with strength across all products. Debit spend remains elevated, and we are seeing further recovery in credit, driven in part by the return of travel and increased discretionary spending. This recovery is led by consumer credit, but it's important to note that commercial credit is also improving and has now reached pre-pandemic levels as well. In terms of how people are spending, they are definitely getting out more as we're seeing improvement in card-present spending, particularly in the travel, retail and restaurant categories, while e-commerce continues to be strong.  
Now turning to cross-border. Proforma card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to be very strong. On the travel front itself, it is clear people want to travel and they do so where and when able to. We've seen this domestically and across borders where there are limited restrictions. For example, we're seeing strength between the U.S. and Latin America as well as an increase in travel within Europe. Our industry reports, there has been a recent increase in bookings for travel between the U.S. and Europe, and the quarantine requirements for entry into Canada are starting to be relaxed, so that's a further opportunity. Overall, we expect more borders to open in the second half of the year, depending, of course, on infection rates, including the recent variants and progress on the vaccination front.
Against this improving backdrop, we are focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our core products supported by our services; second, driving digital enablement, both in stores and online; third, ensuring the ecosystem is safe and secure; and fourth, providing choice through our multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long term by continuing to manage our expenses carefully.  
We'll look at them one by one. First off, we're driving growth in our core products and are leveraging our comprehensive services to do so, working with new and existing customers solve their pain points, both in payments and beyond. We're well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel and remain focused on building on our strength in this area by expanding relationships with our travel partners.  
For example, we have renewed our exclusive co-brand with JetBlue Airlines in the U.S. We also entered into a long-term global partnership with Cathay Pacific and Asia Miles, who will migrate their existing co-brand portfolio to Mastercard. In the Middle East, we have expanded our British Airways co-brand and in Latin America, we are now the preferred brand for LATAM Airlines. It is important to note that our services played a critical role in enabling all these deals, including our data analytics, Test & Learn, loyalty, consulting and cybersecurity solutions.  
Of course, we also continue to drive growth in the core outside of travel. Here are a few examples. We're excited about our partnership with Citi to launch the new Citi Custom Cash Mastercard, offering card members cash back in the top eligible spend category. JPMorgan Chase, we've extended and deepened our agreement in the commercial space, and we have renewed our Maestro brand relationship with Chase in the U.S. We also continue to partner closely with community banks throughout the U.S., including a flip of  First Southern National Bank's debit portfolio to become their exclusive network brand.  
On the digital front, we're well positioned to drive the acceleration of the secular shift with our digital capabilities no matter how consumers want to shop: in store, online or both. As consumers return to in-person shopping, adoption of contactless continues to grow. In the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 45% of in-person purchase transactions globally according to our switched transaction. That's up from 37% a year ago. At the same time, e-commerce continues its strong growth, and we are providing consumers choice on how they want to pay online. For example, Click to Pay, to improve the guest checkout experience, it's now rolled out in over 10 markets, and we continue to launch significant new merchants such as the Canadian Tire group.  
On to the buy-now-pay-later space. In Australia, we're partnering with Citi and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to offer installments to consumers wherever Mastercard is accepted. And whether in store or online, we are securing and streamlining the consumer experience through our tokenization services. Tokenized transactions across in-store, online and in apps surpassed 1 billion per month throughout the second quarter.  
We continue to partner with major digital players to expand the reach of our digital capabilities. For example, we just entered a strategic partnership with Stripe to give business a small control of the how they spend their money by enabling Stripe users to create, manage and distribute virtual and physical cards for small business, commercial and consumer across credit, debit and prepaid.  
We've also entered a partnership with Verizon to bring 5G innovation to the global payments industry. Leveraging our services and insights in pairing Mastercard solution with Verizon's 5G connectivity will allow us to create better experiences from the checkout lines to being billed, even through how businesses are run. The increased capacity and reduced latency of 5G will enable us to take another step towards making every device a commerce device.  
Now on to securing the ecosystem. As more merchants and consumers shift to digital, the importance of keeping the ecosystem safe and secure is paramount and is creating a strong demand for our cyber solutions. In addition to organic growth, a number of our acquisitions in the space continue to perform well.  
For example, Ethoca had strong deal momentum, including a fraud and dispute management agreement with EBANX, a payment solution provider operating across 15 countries in Latin America. RiskRecon, which monitors and then tests those customers' third-party cybersecurity risk, is now scanning millions of companies globally, up from thousands when we acquired them at the end of 2019. NuData is providing biometric fraud prevention tools to Major League Baseball and the neobank, Nickel. We're happy to advance our digital identity capabilities with the acquisition of Ekata that has now closed and off to a strong start on the deal front. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to our initiatives focused on addressing a broader set of payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. The key here is to provide choice, essentially the right tool for the job. With our multi-rail approach, including our expertise and capabilities in cards, real-time payments and support for digital currencies, we are able to deploy the right combination of assets to meet our customers' needs. And more than just having this range of capabilities, we're making these solutions work together seamlessly. Let me give you a few examples.  
In B2B, we're making progress with Mastercard Track building out our global open-loop network by working with buyer agents and supplier agents such as banks, software companies and ERP vendors. On the bank side, we're very excited to have signed Box e-card payments who will use Track to connect their global business customers on both the buyer and the supplier side of the ecosystem across multiple rails. We also signed FreshBooks, a premier accounting software platform with customers in over 100 countries. 
In the Bill Pay space, we continue to scale the Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange, which leverages our real-time payment capabilities to provide a transformative mobile-first experience to bill payments with Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions now connecting into the platform. 
In Mastercard Send, we continue to penetrate a variety of new payment flows beyond traditional card payments. These enabled dozens of use cases and hundreds of programs across every region of the world. For example, we're partnering with innovative digital messaging platforms to offer P2P services to consumers. Today, uses of WhatsApp in Brazil can transfer money directly in-app, leveraging Mastercard Send. We're also partnering with MoneyGram and Checkout to enable near real-time cross-border P2P transfers across Europe. And on the B2C front, we continue to support the fast-growing gig economy, and I'm partnering with PayFair to enable instant earnings payout to some of the largest gig platforms in the U.S. 
Through open banking, Mastercard is empowering people and businesses across the globe to easily and securely gain access to their financial data to create new opportunities for themselves. 
In the U.S., our efforts with Finicity are running ahead of expectations as we continue to enhance direct API connectivity for banks and fintechs. For example, we're partnering with Jack Henry to enable consumers back up more than 400 community financial institutions to use its digital platform to access, use and benefit from their own financial data. The Navy Federal Credit Union vis-à-vis signed direct data access agreements with Finicity. Finicity is also leveraging best-in-class data connections to launch new products in new verticals, such as its Mortgage Verification Service. 
Finally, in terms of cryptocurrency, we're making it easier for cryptocurrency wallets to connect seamlessly to our network through a pilot with Paxos, Circle and Evolve Bank & Trust, which simplifies the conversion of crypto into fiat. Separately, we're partnering with ConsenSys, the Ethereum software engineering firm, to accelerate the development of crypto applications and services to our customers. 
Now summing all this up. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, benefiting from our revenue diversification efforts. We believe that most markets are in the growth phase domestically and there's upside potential in cross-border travel. We're winning significant new deals, and we continue to focus on our strategic priorities to drive growth over the long term. 
Sachin, over to you."

Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting",1460,"Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. 
Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy amidst the strong recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34%, and net income was up 36%, both of which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. 
EPS was up 37% year-over-year to $1.95, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.7 billion worth of stock and an additional $398 million through July 26, 2021. 
So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 33% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 34% with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 50%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 32% with debit growth of 39% and a credit growth of 25%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes up 48% and other cross-border volumes up 71%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the debts of the pandemic last year. In the second quarter, cross-border volume was 87% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe almost back to even at 97% and other cross-border volume at 79% of 2019 levels. 
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 41% year-over-year in Q2 and were at 127% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remain strong and card-present growth continued to improve, aided in part by increases in contactless penetration across every region. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 31% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 36%, while worldwide GDV growth was up 33%. The 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing and mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 60%, while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as cross-border volumes, ex intra-Europe, grew faster than intra-Europe volumes this quarter, partially offset by the lapping of elevated levels of return activity a year ago. 
Transaction processing fees were up 33%, while switched transactions were up 41%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily driven by the lapping of elevated return activity a year ago and adverse mix. 
Other revenues were up 32%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. 
Finally, rebates and incentives were up 49%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. 
Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. 
To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to once again present the 2021 volumes and transactions and the percentage of the 2019 amount when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, the broad-based recovery continued through the second quarter and into July. Specifically, in the first 3 weeks of July, switched volume spend levels are at 130% of 2019 levels, which is a 9 ppt improvement over Q1. We are seeing a further recovery in card-present spending with improvements in travel-related categories, including lodging and restaurants. Also, in the U.S., we have seen consumer airline spend improve significantly since the early part of Q2, with volumes now back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing a switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 show an improving travel trend. Cross-border travel, which includes both card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes increased from 39% to 66% of 2019 levels from April to July, primarily driven by strength in Europe and between the U.S. and Latin America. Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. 
Cross-border card-not-present, ex travel, continues to grow at a healthy rate above pre-pandemic levels. This has moderated recently relative to 2019 levels in part due to a reduced contribution from the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the lapping of significant e-comm promotional activity in 2019. 
Turning now to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and are well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we continue to sign. Domestic spending levels are showing healthy growth, and we are well positioned for the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. Further, our service lines continue to grow at a healthy rate. 
Turning to the third quarter. The spending levels continue to improve along their current trajectory. We would expect Q3 net revenues to grow at the high end of mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, Q2 2020 marked the low point of the pandemic from a spending standpoint with some recovery in the following quarter. So we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 3 ppt in the third quarter. 
It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to new COVID variant and the progress of vaccinations and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. 
In terms of operating expenses, we will continue our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our strategic objectives in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our material solutions, including related brand and product marketing investments. 
For Q3, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of mid-teens rate versus the year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are lapping the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic developed. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have closed on the transaction with Ekata earlier than expected and expect the acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in both Q3 and Q4 as we integrate several acquisitions in promising new growth areas such as open banking, digital identity and real-time payments. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year, after which time we do not split them out. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 1 to 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q3. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. 
And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business and improvement over previous expectation due to some discrete tax benefits realized in Q2. 
One last point, I wanted to let you know that we are planning an investment community meeting for the fall in New York. We are planning a cyber event on November 10, and we look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

Look, the reality is we're running the business for the long term. We're trying to drive long-term revenue growth and at the same time, long-term bottom line growth. And we'll do this in a disciplined manner. We have demonstrated over the period of the pandemic that we have sufficient flexibility in our expense base to actually make sure that we continue to execute on our strategic growth objectives and at the same time, keep an eye on how we're seeing the top line come around. 
So I guess my point to you is the following, which is we will continue to do what's right for the business to drive long-term growth by investing in key strategic areas, both organic and inorganic. And that's kind of where we are. In terms of the specifics on the numbers, it's what I just shared with you.

Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here,",619,"Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question. Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here, which is the Central Bank digital currencies and there's private sector stablecoins and there is a floating cryptos. 
So we told you that we want to be playing a role across all of them. We also said that -- in the first quarter call that as far as stablecoins are concerned, we are getting ready to technologically enable our network to carry these stablecoins as settlement currencies provided they meet one of our -- all 3 of our criteria, which is regulatory compliance, consumer protection and stability. So none of that has changed. 
Let me just give you a view on what has happened since we had that conversation. So on the Central Bank digital currency front, things are definitely continuing to move forward. You see a lot of central banks engaged on the topic. The ECB has just recently announced that they will actually move forward with the digital euro after a period of industry consultation. 
The Bank of England is in its period of industry engagement at this point right now. So there is clear progress. What is our value proposition to central banks and the government in this space is, first of all, we bring a unique perspective to the market as -- to these players as a multi-rail provider because all these countries have to make the trade-off, what is my existing financial system delivering my existing financial infrastructure and what else is the Central Bank digital currency solving for. Everybody has different motivations ranging from financial inclusion to cross-border payments and hence, we're a sought-after party because we have experience in all of that. 
I think a particularly critical proposition here is our virtual test platform because all of these design choices that governments have to make and that we consult them on, we then have to live in the wild, so to say. They've got to work with the existing financial infrastructure, and that's what our virtual test platform does for them. So that's the proposition at this stage for central banks. 
On the private sector stablecoins, nothing much different other than us engaging with private sector players as well as regulators on what does good policy look like around private sector stablecoins because this question about regulatory compliance is still unresolved. The regulators do need to weigh in and we're a part of that dialogue. 
On floating cryptos, here, the point of currency stability is not solved. So we won't be enabling that as settlement currency on our network. But clearly, people want to invest in that. They don't want to sell their investments, and we're going to make this as easy as possible. So we have all these partnerships out there. 
Now here's the thing with our announcement last week. And that is that in digital currency wallets out there oftentimes prefer to stay in crypto as these transactions are like selling and buying of investment. And here's where our partnerships, for example, with Paxos come in. It is our partner that allows these digital wallet to stay in crypto as they settle with Paxos and then Paxos settles with us in fiat. That's an interim step for us and when we reach the point that we might be enabling stablecoins on our network itself. 
So that's kind of where we are, playing a role across the board. This is a relevant technology. As a multi-rail player, we got to be in this space because people are looking for answers."

So the first thing I should say is our commercial business is there. It's coming back. Commercial travel is coming back, as I noted earlier in my comments. So here the focus is on small business, virtual card. And in the B2B space, specifically virtual card solutions, for example, on online travel agencies. So all that is continuing, but it's worth noting, we gave you a number some time back and in 2020, this was 11% of our GDV and that is what we're happy about that. 
Now when it comes to B2B very specifically, the multifaceted approach I talked you through earlier across Bill Pay, Track and the whole list that I talked about. Here, I see that if I take Bill Pay today, if you look at the fact that we have a quarter of all bills being paid addressable at 1/3 of the billers, so that gives us real scale. So I think we have come to a point of scalability here with the right kind of players. 
Last quarter, we added Verizon as a biller to the mix. So that is encouraging. We haven't given specific numbers and we haven't done it this quarter yet, but we really see that's going in the right direction. 
And with Nets coming in, we have a significant footprint in Europe. They run a scaled Bill Pay business over there. So when the time is right, we will share some numbers around that. 
Now at B2B, specifically Track, the excitement around a large bank like Barclays joining the Track ecosystem is great. We've fine-tuned our go-to-market with ERP and software providers. So the rollout here is progressing well with the right -- with both sides, buyer and supplier and buyer and supplier agents. Again, we haven't given numbers yet, but it would be what you would expect when you build a 2-side network. We're starting to have players on both sides. We can start to connect the corridors. So the value proposition of Track, a data switch, a payment optimization engine and the choice in multi-rail payments is really starting to get a hold. We said to you a couple of times, this has been -- this is going to be a multi-rail journey. 
COVID, while there was a realization that B2B supply chains have been affected by COVID and there's a desire to digitize, it wasn't exactly top-of-mind through COVID. So we're starting to see this interest coming back. 
So that's kind of where we are. And Sachin, you have anything to add?"

I'll just make one more point which is, as we think about B2B, we also think about it from a segment approach, right? What is the micro kind of business environment, small business environment, mid-market and then large corporates? And when you actually dissect along those lines, you will see that there's a significant amount of spend which takes place across the micro and small business space. And if you further break that down, you will see that there is a significant amount of that spend which takes place in cash. 
So the only point I'm kind of trying to make is that the value prop of the card rails in B2B still stands and stands pretty strong to displace cash, much like it has in the consumer space. And there's a tremendous opportunity for digitalization to continue down that path there as well. 
So I know we talked a lot about the accounts payable flow, and I think that's super important, but we certainly internally are not losing sight of the fact that a significant amount of cash spend, which still takes place where the value prop of card stands good."

So let me take the last one with kind of like a bit of a cheeky response. I think you will just have to tune in, Craig, to find out if we're going to give a 3-year guidance or a longer-term guidance at the time. 
On interchange, so complex topic for sure and the new administration is looking at various regulatory and lawmaking initiatives. As we all know, we've just seen the news develop yesterday. Now from the outset, we've leaned in with the new administration. We built a really positive relationship. So that is very good. And we're continuing, obviously, the same kind of interaction and engagement on a topic as important as interchange to our industry with lawmakers on the Hill, House and Senate, both sides of the aisle. 
We're monitoring this very closely. There is chatter here and there on interchange. The topic that's always been focused by different parties. What I would say is we've had the benefit of now having many years of playing -- seeing the interchange regulation on debit play out. There's enough data for us out there to say that really what it was intended to do, we can't really see it. Cost for consumers have gone up and benefits have been reduced. We keep providing that data to lawmakers and other interested parties and figures what the facts are stating. 
Now when it comes to interchange regulation applied to credit, you would expect the same in terms of cost impact, in terms of benefits impact, but there is another aspect here, that is the access to credit. You should assume that the access to credit for middle-class Americans is going to be impacted and not in a positive way if this interchange regulation comes in. So it is all something that needs to be thought through very carefully. 
What are the puts and takes? Why does this make sense? And that's the dialogue that we're leaning in. The good thing is we've seen this play out in many other markets around the world and have some experience with that and can then bring to the table as well. So that's kind of where we are, closely monitoring."

So really, I will preface by saying the following, which is, again, it's -- the uncertainty in the environment prevails given all these variants, which are kind of showing up. But the reality is the following, which is it has been clearly demonstrated that people want to travel and they do so when they're able to travel. And that's been shown in the domestic environment, and that's being now shown in the cross-border environment. 
So one of the things which is something which we very closely track is how is it that booking levels are taking place? What's kind of that trajectory of spend looking like or that trajectory of kind of data looking like? And then which are the corridors which are opening up based on -- for example, earlier this week, there was some dialogue around how the U.K. is going to open up to vaccinated people coming from the U.S. and from other countries. 
So the reality is the following, which is the data as we've seen it is what we've shared with you through the first 3 weeks of July. We are positive in terms of our sentiment as we progress through the second half of the year that as people get more vaccinated, more corridors will open up. And as more corridors open up, people will exercise their ability to travel because they have the intent to travel. And this is really, really important because as I look at what's going on across the globe, you could see that the U.S. and Latin America, which has the ability to travel with more borders being opened, people are exercising that and they're showing that come through. 
Similarly, now we're hearing about Canada opening up, which will be, again, something, which is encouraging from our perspective in terms of how people play that out. 
Asia, on the other hand, is still, I would say, at a pretty kind of subdued level just because of the reality of the situation in Asia, being what it is with the variants now actually getting to higher levels in certain countries in Asia. So look, hard to predict. But longer term, I guess, when I kind of look through all of this, what we feel encouraged about is that the vibrancy of travel is something which will come back. And most importantly, we are very well positioned to capitalize on that and when it does come back."

And until you come to the point of who else is not vaccinated, there's a long runway for us for -- this to play out.

So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time is going to level out. I think you're right. Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that.

Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that. But there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly on commercial travel. We'll see how that will play out. 
It's interesting. When you look over the last 2 quarters, we see continued elevated levels of digital e-commerce spend, but we see in-store coming back. So there is not a net-zero game going on. I think this is actually really generally secular trend against cash and that is going to continue to run for a very long time. So it's good to have these 2 legs to stand on from our business model. I think that will remain. 
You'll see some of the e-commerce going to reduce over time, but I don't think we will go back to the levels that we had before the pandemic because people would have learned better experiences and they will like continue with that. I think every bit of consumer research that we do tells us that. And by the way, this is not just for online shopping, it's for digital banking and for contactless. It's for everything across the board. Generally, between 60% and 70% of people that we asked, and we ask them every month, say exactly that. 
With this push towards a more digital world, more data that needs to be kept safe, so I see that the path for our cybersecurity solutions is a very clear one and a very good one, and we will not see a reversion to something there before because you have the elevated driver of more digital just out there driving that business. And frankly, that's the same for data and analytics. 
Data analytics, again, more data, people want to understand it. But back to what Sachin was talking about on small business, here's a bunch of players that have traditionally maybe not used tools like that, understanding and managing their business through data and analytics. But now they can. So there's a whole new segment that's opening up that will -- we would like to serve through our partners in terms of real insights in how do you run a business online from whatever you might have been doing in the brick-and-mortar space before. So I think those are structural changes that are here to last. 
Cross-border, I don't think it's going to be something dramatically structurally changing. That's really the -- well, cross-border e-commerce. I think that is -- that's, again, people would have figured out that this does actually work. It couldn't go anywhere. They were using cross-border e-commerce platforms and tools, and I think that will continue. 
One more thing that comes to mind structurally is the heightened and elevated interest of governments and electronic payments and digital payments. That has started last year. Again, that was driven by the prices initially. ""How do I get my stimulus payments out,"" to now a conversation, ""Wow, this is an interesting space and I found that my infrastructure is dated. I need to partner with people."" 
So that is something that I see fundamentally as an opportunity, but it's important to engage with government as a fair partner and see that local footprint, and things like that do matter and that is -- we are well positioned with our multi-rail infrastructure to do exactly that. 
So there's a few things that come to mind. Back to Lisa's earlier question on B2B, I think this continued interest in digitizing B2B supply chains and B2B payments, that will also play out and grow over time over the next 2, 3 years."

So this is enabling their customer set with basically every payment tool that is available and providing choice. That's, in the end, what this is about. 
Verizon, an entirely different strategic partnership. But here's another network, but a 5G network. We said, what could we do? Back -- we've talked about SME on this call in a couple of occasions now. Think about an SME that today has a card terminal and how they're going to compete with the marketplace. This is a -- if you imagine for a moment, you have a full Internet connectivity with not much infrastructure that you need to bring in, and then you can provide a true omnichannel experience, even the smallest business can do that. That is what 5G can deliver at any endpoint, anywhere at any situation. And that is the vision that Verizon, Hans and his team and our folks that we have developed. This is very specific. We've been on it for a while and we're expecting to make a real difference there. 
So 2 different types of strategic partnerships. I think they both matter, come back to the point that it's -- for us, it's about providing choice and payments to and anyone out there that is transacting in payments."

So a couple of things kind of to point out on that line item, really. At the end of the day, there are things which are, I would call, episodic, which took place in the months of April and June, and there's volatility in the price of crypto. There's more purchases which took place there. And then as the price came down, then you had the inverse effect of that taking place. 
So the reality is that, to us, kind of is one of those things which will remain volatile. And I say that only because I don't know where the price is going to go and how people are going to exercise their choice to purchase crypto on a going-forward basis. What I will tell you is we've seen a decent level of deceleration take place in how people are utilizing Mastercard products to purchase these digital currencies like crypto over the last 3 weeks as reflected in the numbers. So that's kind of one of the factors which influenced that. 
The second being just a tougher comp where the timing of that e-comm promotional activity which took place in 2019 happened to be in the first 3 weeks of July. So the comp is a tougher comp here. So that I don't view as something which is on a going-forward basis is going to be impacting what the so-called index growth rate is for this line item, 2021 versus 2019. Suffice it to say the following, which is the trend towards digital continues. It's true in domestic. It's true in cross-border. And the fact that, that is a positive feel, going back to what Michael just talked about in terms of structural changes is something we are well positioned to actually keep participating in as the economies evolve and things start to open up in different parts of the globe.

So on cross-border, Jason, mentioning nicely that, look, you're aware about the fact that intra-Europe cross-border is low yielding than all other cross-border. And I think that's one thing to keep in mind because growth rates across those populations of spend will determine what revenue growth rate ultimately looks like. 
The reality is in the second quarter, we had a tougher comp from an elevated level of returns that we had seen in last year, which had the impact of subduing our cross-border volume fee growth rate some in this second quarter. And again, it's not like those returns and elevated revenues of returns only took place in the second quarter of last year. As the pandemic hit, people start to make cancellations in terms of their airline bookings, their hotel bookings, and that kind of -- while it tapered, it still occurred going into the third quarter as well. So just something to keep in mind as to what the puts and takes are when you're thinking about growth rates. 
On rebates and incentives, here's what I would tell you. I think you're very well aware about the focus of the company on making sure we are setting ourselves up to quickly win market share, and winning market share comes through creating fantastic value propositions and then delivering them at great value to our customers, which is where the rebates and incentives come into play. 
So we continue to do that, and we will continue to do new and renew deals, which will have an impact on rebates and incentives. So the one point -- the one more piece of information I'll share with you is that as it relates to Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be generally in line with what we saw in Q2.

So you'll rarely see us compete with other services player on a pure play that has nothing to do with our position in payments. So that's the starting point of our strategy. And we're looking for adjacencies that just leverage our core competencies. 
Now when it comes to the cyber solutions, if I think about a product like Decision Intelligence, which basically helps our customers to make -- decide what's a good decision and what is not a good decision, it is exactly at the sweet spot of everything that I said. It's the transaction data. It's the availability of having this in real time in our system available and then using state-of-the-art AI to make the decisions for our customers. 
So here, I think we have -- from a competitive landscape perspective, a real leg up versus pure plays. Similarly in loyalty, we're one of the largest loyalty players in the world. They are pure plays, but the fact that we see all the transaction flow and we can look at aggregated anonymized data of look-alikes and what they are interested in and how their preferences go in terms of rewards, offers, managed programs and so forth, again, puts us in a differentiated proposition. 
You'd go -- but you see us building out our proposition in cyber coming back to that, looking at the whole value chain. Decision Intelligence about the transaction before the transaction, what we're now doing with Ekata and saying it's the foundational element. So here we go in. Ekata, in itself, has a set of data that allows us in real time to help a customer -- one of our customers decide if this account opening request is a good one or a bad one. There's a very high confidence score. That customer is obviously then interested in working with us on the downstream through the whole value chain of the transaction and other cybersecurity solutions, all the way to fulfillment, against, say, is that address actually a real address? So is this somebody that is just ordering something in somebody else's name. 
So that's how we're thinking about it holistically and leveraging our footprint in payments."

Great point. So open banking, an important trend. What we really like is this whole concept of putting power into the hand of the individual using their own data to get a better choice in services, the financial services and other services eventually. So we like that. 
We've been active in Europe for 3 years now -- 2 years now. We went live in summer 2019 over there. Good momentum. You heard us talk about Tesco and Lloyd's in the U.K., set up use cases that are now live. So happy about that. Good footprint over there. 
And in here in Finicity, that was a real kick for us in closing that transaction in November last year. And the Finicity team, first of all, they're deep in permission API, in the invention of the FDX standards. So they live and breathe open banking, and that was really critical for us as a player here in the U.S., great incumbent in the market. 
Now what is going better than expectations? I see a lot of momentum in engaging with banks. They have best-in-class data, data connections and they had a best footprint in banks, but we're -- now that as everybody else is looking at that and said, let's connect with Finicity. But we also see progress on the fintech side because this is an ecosystem that works on both sides. 
So we're excited about that. They had an interesting set of solutions today, that account verification, credit decisioning assistance. And now with the mortgage verification service, we're starting to build out at the same time, although driving -- on the deal front, we're also expanding the product set by bringing our data together with their data and our tech talent with their tech talent. So on every dimension, really around Finicity, we're quite happy that we have a connection.
All right. Good. I think that brings us to the end of our time. I gave you a summary of a quarter just earlier on, so I'm not just going to repeat that again. I just want to thank you for all your support all throughout and looking forward to speaking to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much and goodbye."

Good morning, everyone. So let me start by giving you the highlights of the quarter. Strong revenue and earnings growth continued. The net revenue up 29% and EPS up 48% versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis.",1758,"Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. So let me start by giving you the highlights of the quarter. Strong revenue and earnings growth continued. The net revenue up 29% and EPS up 48% versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On the same basis, quarter 3 net revenues are now 11% above pre-COVID levels in 2019. We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending and overall cross-border volumes are now back at 2019 levels, though there still remains significant growth for growth in cross-border travel. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities, with good progress on the product and deal fronts this quarter, and we're excited about our acquisition of CipherTrace in the crypto services area and our planned acquisition of Aiia in open banking. 
So those are the highlights, looking at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to improve, even though economies are facing supply chain constraints, rising energy prices and some other inflationary pressures. According to our quarter 3 spending post report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales ex-auto, ex-gas, were up 5% versus a year ago and 12% versus 2019, reflecting the return to in-person shopping and the ongoing e-commerce strength. Spending cost also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter 3 were up 5% and 6% versus 2019. 
As it relates to COVID specifically, the outlook continues to get better, with case numbers generally improving, new therapeutics in the pipeline, progress on vaccinations and businesses becoming more agile in the face of remaining restrictions. We're also seeing a general trend toward the opening of travel corridors, notably inbound into the U.S. and some easing of restrictions in Asia. 
Now turning to our business, while the pandemic is not fully behind us, we're now in the growth phase in most markets domestically and in many markets in cross-border spending as well. We will, therefore, turn the page and move beyond the [ 4-phase framework ] that guided us through the last 19 months and focus on managing the business for the growth opportunity ahead of us. 
Looking at Mastercard's spending trends. Switched volumes improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw particular strength in consumer and commercial credit. Debit spend remains elevated, although it has moderated in recent weeks in part due to waning stimulus benefits. In terms of how people are spending, card-present volumes continue to improve as people are getting out and shopping more, while we're still seeing sustained strength in card-not-present spend. So regardless of whether people want to shop online or in-person, our solutions support that choice and position us well to participate in both trends. 
Now let's take a look at cross-border. Overall, cross-border returned to 2019 levels in August, driven by improvements in consumer and commercial travel as well as the ongoing strength of cross-border card-not-present spending ex-travel. Our cross-border travel improved from 48% of 2019 levels in the second quarter to 72% this quarter, with substantial upside potential still remaining as and when borders open. Against this backdrop, we're investing in the growth of our business, including the enhancing end of our leading technology capabilities, like expanding our network edge to connect directly with our customers through the cloud, providing faster and easier access to our products and services. 
And of course, we remain focused on our strategic priorities. Number one, rolling our core products are driving the shift to digital; two, differentiating and diversifying with our services; and three, leveraging our multi-rail capabilities to offer choice across payment applications. 
Now let's take them one by one and turn to how we're growing our core products and driving the shift through digital, through Mastercard Installments, by winning core deals and by continuing our momentum in the fintech space. First, let me tell you about our recently-announced Mastercard Installments, our scalable, open loop, buy-now-pay-later solution. Mastercard Installments is differentiated in that it enables banks, lenders, fintechs and wallets to seamlessly bring buy-now-pay-later solutions to consumers and merchants at scale and in a secure, tokenized manner. With little to no integration for merchants, our solution avoids the need for lenders to engage merchants one by one to roll this out, enables them to deliver more payment options to more consumers faster. 
Our solution brings choice at scale, delivered through the Mastercard network. Our consumers will be able to access buy-now-pay-later offers through their bank's mobile banking app at the point of checkout, and soon, directly through Click to Pay. The embedded power of unicity will help lenders with credit positioning and enable consumers to easily choose different repayment options. Mastercard Installments will power our core payments and enable us to provide additional value through services such as data analytics, loyalty and front tools. 
We've seen strong interest from players on all sides of the ecosystem and look forward to growing our partnerships in this area. As always, we remain focused on continuing to grow share, and we've won deals across the globe this quarter. In the U.K., we're partnering with Chase as the preferred debit partner of their new digital retail bank. In Canada, we've extended our exclusive co-brand with Costco Canada. And in Brazil, we signed a deal with [ AutoPass ] to issue more than 10 million cards to mass transit users in the Sao Paulo area, and along with that, open contactless acceptance across their subway trains and city buses. 
We're also building our leading position with fintechs and mobile money providers. Here are a few recent examples. PayPal has extended its PayPal business debit card into our 4 markets in Europe. PayPal will also directly leverage Mastercard Send for domestic wallet cash-outs and P2P transactions in the U.S. We're partnering with Vodafone in Egypt across all of their mobile money use cases, including cash outs, P2P and bill payment. We expanded our strategic partnership with Yandex in Russia and will be their preferred international partner for all of their fintech initiatives. And [ FINTERRA ], an innovative market leader that connects U.S. banks and fintechs to get cards and financial products into the market will leverage our digital first, Finicity, Mastercard Send and cybersecurity assets. 
Now shifting to services. Our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in enabling many of the wins I just mentioned. They, of course, also diversify our business. We've had many wins in this area this quarter. Starting with the cybersecurity space, Epic is helping multiple players, including AT&T and Mecardo Libre reduce chargebacks through collaboration, thereby creating purchase transparency. Banco de Bogota is using our artificial intelligence capabilities to improve consumer experiences, increase profitability and identify new opportunities. And in Europe, [ Motorenn ] is leveraging new data's behavioral biometrics to help thousands of new banks authenticate online transactions. 
Data analytics, the tourism agencies in Greece, Hungary and elsewhere are using services like tourism insights and managed services to gather greater visibility of trends and drive deeper insights to support their tourism campaigns. In the UAE, HSBC is leveraging our test and learn capabilities to innovate, experiment and roll out new products for better customer engagement. And we're having success in the loyalty space with our innovative digital solutions, driving wins with players like the global fitness chain Barry's and [ by first ] and Saudi National Bank. 
Now let's turn to the progress we've made in offering choice to consumers across payment applications with our multi-rail capabilities, including open banking, B2B and crypto. In open banking, we're happy about our planned acquisition of Aiia. Aiia is a leading European open banking player, whose platform, expertise, strong API connectivity and payment capabilities complement our existing open banking assets. We will combine Aiia's European footprint with Finicity's connectivity in the U.S. and our expansion into other markets like Australia. This will allow us to extend each organization's best-in-class capabilities such as credit decisioning, credit scoring, account information services and payment applications across markets. 
Talking about markets, we continue to make progress with our open banking product in Europe, players like [ Entercard ], one of Scandinavia's leading credit card companies. And in the U.S., Finicity is working with [ UZO ] to enable account opening verifications along with future plans to expand into payments. In B2B, we continue to expand the [ Track Business Payment Service ] network with key partners like JPMorgan Chase, as well as merchant acquirers, such as Moneris, the largest acquirer and leading processor of B2B transactions in Canada, and [ Priority Commercial Payments ], a leading payments technology company in commercial payment solutions in the U.S. 
We're also adding new functionality to track DBS and are partnering with [ Emicard ] to launch a supply chain finance capability. This functionality empowers payment agents to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital directly through the Mastercard Track DBS platform. And in the U.K., HSBC will be the first to issue a Mastercard Track card to account transfer product, an innovative B2B payment solution that allows businesses to use their commercial card program to make payments to any supplier, even if that supplier does not accept card payments. Again, a true multi-rail offering. 
And finally, in the crypto space, we're making it easier for crypto players to connect to our network. We signed up a number of new crypto wallet providers and exchanges this quarter, including with TUMI, [ Novo Pago U.K], [ Tanga by Zen.com ], Coinmotion and Coin Jar. Our cryptoprogram, which is based on played principles of engagement, allows consumers to easily buy crypto assets with their Mastercard, spend their crypto balances wherever Mastercard is accepted, cash out their proceeds with Mastercard Send and earn rewards in the form of crypto or even NFT. 
We're also seeing a growing services opportunity in this space. Earlier this month, we acquired CipherTrace, a security and fraud monitoring company with expertise, technologies and insights into more than 900 cryptocurrencies. Our recently announced agreement with [ Spark ] will also add to our expanding crypto services portfolio. 
So let me sum this up one more time. We delivered strong revenue, earnings growth this quarter. We are seeing continued strength in domestic spending in most markets. And while overall cross-border volumes are back at 2019 levels, there remains significant room for growth in cross-border travel. We're executing against our strategic priorities with good progress on the product and deal front, as you heard, we're doing all of that while carefully managing our expenses. 
That's it for me, Sachin, over to you."
6477196,1684902607,2415626,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was u",1362,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. 
Net revenue was up 29%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 45%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Further, net income growth was also positively impacted by 6 ppt due to the recognition of higher onetime discrete U.S. tax benefits versus a year ago. EPS was up 48% year-over-year to $2.37, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $361 million through October 25, 2021. 
So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in both debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 20% with debit growth of 9% and credit growth of 36%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 20%, with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 16%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 121%, up 2 ppt sequentially, with credit at 111%, up 4 ppt sequentially and debit at 131% flat quarter-over-quarter. 
Cross-border volume was up 52% globally for the quarter, with [ intra-Europe cross-border ] volumes up 47% and other cross-border volumes up 60%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the pandemic last year. In the third quarter, cross-border volume was at 97% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at 112% and other cross-border volume at 83% of 2019 levels. Notably, cross-border volumes averaged at or above 100% of 2019 levels in the months of August and September. 
Turning now to Page 5, switched transactions grew 25% year-over-year in Q3 and were at 131% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remained strong and card-present growth continue to improve.  Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In Q3, contactless transactions represented 48% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 45% last quarter. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 29% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 21%, while worldwide GDV grew 20%. Cross-border volume fees increased 59%, while cross-border volumes increased 52%. The 7 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding, ex-intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 26%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 25%. Other revenues were up 35%, including a 10 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 34%, reflecting the strong growth in volume of transactions and new and renewed deal activity. 
Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 16%, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, including -- sorry, increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. 
Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of October. We are seeing continued strength in growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we are once again showing 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, but we are not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, through the first 3 weeks of October, the recent trends have continued with overall switched volumes at 134% of 2019 levels, up 3 ppt versus Q3. The U.S. has held steady, with some moderation in growth from earlier levels due to the roll off of stimulus, and outside the U.S., we have seen continued improvement. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. 
In terms of cross-border, as I noted earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 were back to pre-pandemic levels starting in August. That improving trend has continued through the first 3 weeks of October, and we are now at 105% of 2019 levels. This improvement is driven by increases in both travel and nontravel cross-border volumes. As it relates to travel, we have seen it picking up in all regions, notably within and to Europe and recently, into Canada as well. 
Turning to Page 9, I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, our deal momentum and service lines continue to position us well for growth and diversify our revenues, and we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives. Domestic spending levels remain healthy, and we are encouraged by the recent resurgence in international travel. We are optimistic about the announced relaxation of border restrictions in places like the U.S. and the U.K., given that we have seen travel pickup when borders have opened in the past. Further, the airlines have recently reported increased travel bookings, including long-haul travel. With this as context, assuming domestic and cross-border spending trends relative to 2019 continue to improve, we would expect Q4 net revenues to grow at a low 20s rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. 
As a reminder, spending recovered progressively in 2020, so we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 7 ppt in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to the pandemic, and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. 
In terms of operating expenses for the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of low double digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our disciplined approach to expense management, while advancing our innovation agenda across payments, services and promising new adjacencies and continued investment in brand and product marketing. 
With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to now have closed on the CipherTrace transaction, and we expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue and 8 ppt to operating expense growth in Q4. This reflects the integration of several acquisitions in the open banking, digital identity and real-time payment areas. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about 0.5 ppt headwind to both net revenue and operating expenses in Q4. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $120 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the fourth quarter. 
Thanks, and I hope you will be able to participate in our virtual investment community meeting on November 10. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

Let me take that question first. So buy-now-pay-later, exciting space. We talked about it for years, invested with our own installment proposition facing off to banks 5, 6 years ago, the partnerships and now as of late Mastercard Installments as you said. You saw a strong lineup of initial partners, bank partners initially. I mean the thought is to remind everybody again, here is a proposition that we have built into our network. So this is really delivered with no hassle for merchants or for lenders at the point of sale. 
So the reaction from banks are strong. Here in the U.S., that's where our lineup of U.S. partners, lending partners was. But I spent time on the roads over the last 3 weeks in Europe and similar conversation emerged there. It was just a couple of days after the announcement over in Italy and banks were saying, ""Wow, this makes a lot of sense."" It's really avoiding a significant headache for us and get into a space that we all believe is important from a consumer perspective. 
On the fintech side, fintech lenders, novel lenders, we lean in with fintechs, some call them disruptors. We feel these are partnerships, we should enable anybody who wants to come on our network. And we're certainly marketing this to ensure that we have the full breadth of what the market has in terms of lending offering. That's going to be good for consumers and merchants.

Choice in payments has been a theme for Mastercard now for, I think, basically always, but specifically with our investments in the account-to-account space over the last 6 years. So we see the demand from merchants and from consumers. For the consumer, it makes sense because you get all your spend into -- you can see it all on one bank account, that would be one aspect to why consumers might like that. Merchants like it for choice and higher baskets of more sales. 
So the interest is clearly there. We've been on this journey for a while, and we don't necessarily see this as a disintermediation opportunity. I mean that's certainly something to watch, but we look at it as an opportunity. We say this could be additional volumes that we've not been involved with. This could be what was historically the consumer finance business. This would be something that was just the direct debit business that we've seen in some European countries and so forth. 
So that's broadly how we look at it. We built a full stack around this that helps to get your money from A to B. But that's just half of the story. Probably not even half of the story because it's a whole experience that really matters. You got to have the security. What happens if you do a push payment and you want your money back? Some of those best practices that we've learned over the last decades in cards is what we are intending to build here. So it's interesting to see blogs out there on how account to account might look like. We have 4 years now, in pay by account in the U.K. We've got those learnings. We're ahead of the market here, very clearly knowing what works, what the economic model should look like, what the proposition is that we really make a difference for merchants, for acquirers who will be all playing in this space. So I don't see a disintermediation risk. I see an opportunity for us to extend our partnerships and gain new flows."

So Brian, I'll go ahead and take that. The first, I know you're asking specifically about cross-border travel, but I just want to kind of put the headline out there, which is for cross-border as a whole, we have seen very strong growth in Q3, as you've seen. And yes, travel has been a big component of that, specifically, travel between Q2 and Q3 has gone from what was 48% of 2019 levels to 72% in Q3. And now in the first 3 weeks of October is tracking more like at 77%. 
And look, what this signals to us very clearly is if people can travel, they will travel. And I think that's really, really important to recognize. And then when you overlay that with what's going on in the nature of announcements, around opening up borders, more specifically, the U.S. has recently talked about inbound travel into the U.S. In fact, I think just a couple of days ago, they laid out the actual details around how people can come into the U.S. I mean you combine that with the fact that Europe has opened up, the U.K. showing good signals of opening up, even in Asia, we're starting to see corridors between Singapore and Australia, Singapore and India, these corridors are all starting to open up. These are all encouraging signs for us from a cross-border travel standpoint. 
We remain optimistic on that front, especially given that if those borders open up and they come with what would be light burdens from a quarantining standpoint, which is what we are seeing right now. People have said that they will travel and they've demonstrated that through Q3. So net-net, here is what I'll tell you, I think travel is something which people want to do. They're showing their willingness to do it. Now it's a question of which are the other countries, which will open up in addition to the borders I've just talked about. And you're reflecting -- you're seeing this to be reflected in the bookings, which airlines are reporting as well. 
So we remain optimistic on this front. I can't really tell you specifically which day, which month it's going to reach to 100% of 2019 levels. But generally, the trend is more moving in the right direction there."

I think you know all of this, but I'll just kind of state it here. A few things. We think that incentives is very dependent on the timing of deals and how volume and mix plays out. And it goes to your point around what the mix is between domestic and cross-border, how you model that and bring that in there. In Q4, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially due to increased deal activity. This is pretty normal for us in Q4, and that's what you should expect also going into Q4 of this year. 
Look, at the end of the day, a lot is going to depend upon, like I said, what the mix is going to look like. We have said in the past that cross-border revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So again, depending on mix between domestic and cross-border, that will inform our kind of views around where previous had said this will go on a going-forward basis. Of course, new and renewed deals, which we remain very active in the market are also going to be a contributing factor."

Why are we doing that? We're doing it because here's the 450 million consumers who cannot use a Mastercard online because it doesn't work online. Debit Mastercard is, now in its latest form, available in a digital first form. You don't even need a physical card any longer, if that's what you want to do, or you want it with contactless, it gives you the full breadth of choice. So that is why we're doing this.

So look, I mean, there's been obviously a lot of talk recently about high inflation levels, whether it's permanent, whether it's long term, whether it's just transitionary. The reality is the structure of our business model is quite conducive because of the way we price, right? I mean we've got basis points, we've got cents per transaction as it relates to how we enter price. So we kind of view the following, which is, to the extent that inflation is moderate, right, we think that -- of that to be a positive tailwind kind of to our business. Again, gradual and moderate inflation is going to be helpful. 
And the reason I bring that up is any sort of shock to the economy, i.e., any sort of hyperinflationary event, oftentimes comes with drastic measures from an interest rate standpoint and comes in with cost pressures which come along with that. So to the extent it's moderate, it's moderately kind of positive for our business. 
The other thing I would say is it's important to actually see in the basket of goods and services what are the products and services which are subject to inflation and what is the amount of electronification of the flows, which have taken place and relevance to our business. So to the extent there's inflation, general inflation taking place in categories which are unrelated to card payments, I mean that kind of is a net not event for us. To the extent it's on things which relate to consumer spending, which have been electronified. It goes back to my point around a moderate inflation being a mild positive here."

Now, Darrin, on your second question, structural changes, are they here to last, what makes a trend. Fascinating question. I don't want to upfront the Investor Day, but since you asked the question, I'll give you a couple of highlights on how we're thinking about that. 
So the first thing is it helps to understand the cycle of the changing consumer of the small business or everybody who's kind of in the payment space as an end user. And we now have 19 months of studies looking at this. And the numbers have really not changed. Somewhere around 70% of people and business are saying more digital banking will be what they will be doing going forward. More online shopping is what they will be doing going forward and more contactless. So the secular trend that was playing in our favor for years has clearly accelerated. And if you just look at this quarter's numbers, we talked about sustained e-commerce strength, while in-person shopping is coming back. So behavior is truly sticking. 
So that is -- I think that's the most fundamental point that we're seeing coming through. The rates to this digital economy is on. And what that also means is a lot of players want to come in. So there are structural changes in the sense of that the competitive playing field is opening up. More partners are coming in, which for B2B2C player like us as a great opportunity to facilitate the entry of all of these partners. So that's what we're doing. Then you start to look around and say, ""Well, who else is looking at this,"" these kind of trends and these kind of developments, most notably governments. Governments are looking at this and they have found that over the last 19 months, that payments is indeed national critical infrastructure. 
So that comes with government engagement, which is not always necessarily positive, but what we're seeing is this a real drive to modernize payment infrastructure. And that is where we are invited to the table because, we are a true multi-rail network, and they're saying, ""Hey, you're locally invested, you're a locally-relevant partner. Let's talk about how do we make this better in our country."" So that is certainly a structural change as in -- Tien-Tsin asked earlier about new payment flows coming in, open banking, et cetera, in Europe. So we're playing on all of those trends going forward. 
So I think that is what is happening. You could -- I could go on for a while longer. B2B, clearly digitizing supply chains is a drive that is in focus. We're seeing that data analytics and cybersecurity. That's the last point I want to make on this. With the rate towards a more digital economy, there's going to be more data that is available. More business will seek to use that data and run their business in a better way, find more customers. Our test and learn capabilities and our data analytics capabilities help on that. So again, that's a structural trend that's helpful. And the same applies for cyber and security, more digital transactions need to be safe, more people need to be authenticated as they use these tools. Again, that plays into our offering. So structural change is really driven by COVID accelerating the race to digital."

So the journey towards account-to-account in Europe, I think it's still early days. If you look at how [ PSD2 ] has rolled out in Europe starting in September 2019, including the strong customer authentication, has been a long journey. Data have been moved on multiple occasions to give time to the industry to get this right. And get right means that the transaction isn't so secure that nobody can use it any longer. So the trade-off between consumer experience and security is actually found in a balanced way. And what we are seeing in our engagements in Europe is that balance is starting to be struck. So we will reach a point where such strong customer authentication in cards as well as in other forms of payments will be actually a reality in Europe. So that's the first thing I want to say. 
When it comes to open banking specifically, so there has been, over the last 2 years, really a focus on driving connectivity in Europe, in terms of getting the open banking ecosystem stood up. That's exactly why we put out in our connectivity product in June 2019. That was the first lead into the region, and we've been quite busy with that. Use cases emerging on the basis of that really started in 2020. The U.K. being ahead of Continental Europe on that, while this was still [ EUR 1. ] And U.K. is still pushing ahead. You heard us talk about Lloyd's on card repayments, about our partnership with Tesco. So the payment capability part of open banking is really leading in the U.K. and here, our proposition is very well positioned. So we start to see that. 
And I see the wave coming over to Continental Europe as connectivity is now there. Our acquisition of Aiia is perfectly timed here. We expect to close this by the end of the year to not bring in additional -- only bring in additional connectivity but also additional payment capabilities because I do see this is not just a data capability, it's a big data -- kind of a data play, account obligation, personal finance management and so forth, but it's also a payment opportunity."

6477196,1684902607,2415626,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Yes, Harshita. So always an exciting topic. And we could not have an earnings call without talking about crypto. So I'm happy you brought it up. Looking at this from a number of perspectives, other than that there's a lot going on in the space. And we are",566,"Yes, Harshita. So always an exciting topic. And we could not have an earnings call without talking about crypto. So I'm happy you brought it up. Looking at this from a number of perspectives, other than that there's a lot going on in the space. And we are pretty clear on how we want to play in this. 
So the first is we see significant volumes in terms of people actually investing in crypto and selling crypto. So as an asset class, there's a lot going on. And I think we have a role to play to facilitate consumers wanting to do that, that's what they choose to do. So these partnership programs on exchanges, crypto exchanges and wallet partners and so forth, have been quite important for us and that is good from a volume perspective. There's real activity. 
When it comes to crypto as a payment tool, then we take a somewhat differentiated view on that versus the -- we just stepped into that. We're saying at this point in time, the most likely chance of this kind of technology to work for payments is issued through a government in the form of Central Bank digital currency. We've said that on a couple of calls before and we said we will make our network ready to do that as and when a government is ready to put out a central bank digital currency and then it will exist alongside the dollar or the euro settlement currency in our network. So we've done that. 
But that's easily said, how will the government test that, how will a country figure out between the private sector banks and the government, how to do this. That's where our sandbox comes in. So we can provide a safe space for government and private sector banks to figure out how that would actually work. Questions like the last mile, how do you bring utility into the hand of your citizens, if you put out a Central Bank digital currency, acceptance questions and so forth. So facilitating investments as an asset class, we do that and we get ready for CBDC. Should there be a private sector stable coin, we might also do that, but we have very strict principles on when to do this and when not. 
Now let me talk about CipherTrace for a moment, because this space is a really interesting space in so many ways, questions on data privacy, question and authentication. We just touched on that in the context of Europe and strong customer authentication. We have to expect the Europeans will say, well, strong customer authentication will, of course, play a role in crypto transactions as well, which is where we always lead with security and trust. I mean that is really synonymous with the name of Mastercard when it comes to payments that we have to do the same role. So it's massive services opportunity. CipherTrace, 900 cryptocurrencies, what does CipherTrace actually do, they drive compliance and AML checks into crypto transactions. We can't run fast enough right now to get into the space because a lot of other people are deep into crypto and these questions are not resolved. So asset class, CBDCs and a services opportunity, those are the 3 ways that we feel we want to play and we need to play and we have the differentiated assets to do so."

So here's a blog post that describes the account-to-account. We have account-to-account technology really since the acquisition of Vocalink. And we've learned how that works. We like it because it's an additional choice that is provided to consumers and to merchants. But we also have all the learnings and the learning still around like how do you create acceptance into that. How do you make it easy for a merchant, how do you actually convince a consumer that actually likes the card proposition. 
So all of that, it is about standing up an ecosystem. So what we believe is this should be something that is built into our network, into our multi-rail capabilities, and it's actually how we're approaching it. So we're leaning into this. I don't see it as a disruption, that's been our stated strategy. And we have 5 years of learnings, and I think that puts us ahead of the curve to make this a reality. I think this is a interesting alternative when it comes to consumer payments in store. And we have it, we build it. It's for us to really figure out whether the economics settle, what other capabilities that are currently built into our card franchise can we extend into the world of account-to-account payments, for example, chargebacks, those kind of data protection and so forth. 
So that's the direction that we're taking. Not really a disintermediation question. An interesting blog, the good things we've done in reality."

So look, I mean, the value prop we used to deliver through cross-border payments on our card products, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic is exactly the same. So we don't expect that the economic returns, but which they will generate should be any different, given that the value we delivered previously, if anything, has only gotten better over a period of time with more electronification of flows taking place. 
To your point around several other account-to-account capabilities, which are there in the cross-border space, the reality is we're participating in them today. But it happened to be going after flows, which are not carded flows. They're not point of sales flows. They happen to be more in the nature of business-to-business payments. We do that with our -- you remember, we acquired a company called Transfast, in addition to the fact that we have our capabilities from HomeSend, the combined capability of that is our cross-border and capabilities, which is account-to-account cross-border payments. 
And we'll participate in those flows, but those are separate and distinct from what goes on at the point of sale with our card products today. So net-net, I kind of view the whole cross-border space as a positive for us as and when travel comes back from a card standpoint. And in the meantime, we continue to actually plant flags in different parts of the world with the reach we've established on our B2B flows from a cross-border standpoint."

So I think the answer to the first part of your question, I think you kind of touched upon on the second part of your question, which talked about how revenues are realized on cross-border is very much a function even in that extra intra-Europe kind of category, it will depend on every corridor, every corridor has got a different yields. And depending on which ones come back first, which ones come back after the numbers from a cross-border revenue standpoint will kind of move around. 
As it relates to what we're seeing, look, I mean, I'll tell you pre-pandemic, important corridors for Mastercard included, obviously, U.S. to Canada, the U.S. to the U.K., the U.K. to various parts in Continental Europe, these are all very important corridors. We've seen Intra-Europe come back pretty nicely. The U.S. inbound is still to happen. I mean there's a little bit of happening, but there's more to come as borders open. Canada has started to open up. As you know, Canada opened up in the third quarter. We've seen signs of recovery take place in terms of inbound into Canada as well. 
And these are important corridors for our business. The one area which I will say is still a little bit kind of yet to be seen is Asia Pacific, right? In Asia Pacific, recovery in cross-border has still been kind of somewhat muted. We'll see how borders open up there and what that kind of shapes up to be.

So let me start by giving you the highlights of the quarter. Strong revenue and earnings growth continued. The net revenue up 29% and EPS up 48% versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On this same basis, quarter 3 net revenues are now 11% above pre-COVID levels in 2019. 
We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending and overall cross-border volumes are now back at 2019 levels, though there still remains significant room for growth in cross-border travel. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities with good progress on the product and deal fronts this quarter. And we're excited about our acquisition of CipherTrace in the crypto services area and our planned acquisition of Aiia in open banking. So those are the highlights. 
Looking at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to improve, even though economies are facing supply chain constraints, rising energy prices and some other inflationary pressures. According to our quarter 3 SpendingPulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales ex auto, ex gas were up 5% versus a year ago and 12% versus 2019, reflecting the return to in-person shopping and the ongoing e-commerce strength. SpendingPulse also indicated that the overall European retail sales in quarter 3 were up 5% and 6% versus 2019.  
As it relates to COVID specifically, the outlook continues to get better with case numbers generally improving, new therapeutics in the pipeline, progress on vaccinations and businesses becoming more agile in the face of remaining restrictions. We're also seeing a general trend toward the opening of travel corridors, notably inbound into the U.S. and some easing of restrictions in Asia.  
Now turning to our business. While the pandemic is not fully behind us, we're now in the growth phase in most markets domestically and in many markets in cross-border spending as well. We will, therefore, turn the page and move beyond the 4-phased framework that guided us through the last 19 months and focus on managing the business for the growth opportunities ahead of us.  
Looking at Mastercard's spending trends. Switched volumes improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw particular strength in consumer and commercial credit. Debit spend remains elevated, although it has moderated in recent weeks in part due to waning stimulus benefits. In terms of how people are spending, card-present volumes continue to improve as people are getting out and shopping more while we are still seeing sustained strength in card-not-present spend. So regardless of whether people want to shop online or in-person, our solutions support that choice and position us well to participate in both trends.  
Now let's take a look at cross-border. Overall, cross-border returned to 2019 levels in August, driven by improvements in consumer and commercial travel as well as the ongoing strength of cross-border card-not-present spending ex travel. Our cross-border travel improved from 48% of 2019 levels in the second quarter to 72% this quarter with substantial upside potential still remaining as and when borders open. 
Against this backdrop, we're investing in the growth of our business, including the enhancing end of our leading technology capabilities, like expanding our network edge to connect directly with our customers through the cloud, providing faster and easier access to our products and services. And of course, we remain focused on our strategic priorities: number one, rolling out core products while driving the shift to digital; two, differentiating and diversifying with our services; and three, leveraging our multi-rail capabilities to offer choice across payment applications.  
Now let's take them one-by-one and turn to how we're growing our core products and driving the shift through digital: through Mastercard Installments, by winning core deals and by continuing our momentum in the fintech space. First, let me tell you about our recently announced Mastercard Installments, our scalable, open loop, buy-now-pay-later solution. Mastercard Installments is differentiated in that it enables banks, lenders, fintechs and wallets to seamlessly bring buy-now-pay-later solutions to consumers and merchants at scale and in a secure, tokenized manner. 
With little to no integration for merchants, our solution avoids the need for lenders to engage merchants one-by-one to roll this out, enables them to deliver more payment options to more consumers faster. Our solution brings choice at scale, delivered through the Mastercard network. Our consumers will be able to access buy-now-pay-later offers through their bank's mobile banking app at the point of checkout and soon directly through Click to Pay. 
The embedded power of Finicity will help lenders with credit positioning and enable consumers to easily choose different repayment options. Mastercard Installments will power our core payments and enable us to provide additional value through services, such as data analytics, loyalty and [ fraud tools ]. We've seen strong interest from players on all sides of the ecosystem and look forward to growing our partnerships in this area. 
As always, we remain focused on continuing to grow share. And we've won deals across the globe this quarter. In the U.K., we're partnering with Chase as the preferred debit partner of their new digital retail bank. In Canada, we've extended our exclusive co-brand with Costco Canada. And in Brazil, we signed a deal with Autopass to issue more than 10 million cards to mass transit users in the São Paulo area, and along with that, open, contactless acceptance across their subway trains and city buses.  
We're also building our leading position with fintechs and mobile money providers. Here are a few recent examples. PayPal has extended its PayPal Business Debit card into our four markets in Europe. PayPal will also directly leverage Mastercard Send for domestic wallet cash-outs and P2P transactions in the U.S. We're partnering with Vodafone in Egypt across all of their mobile money use cases, including cash-outs, P2P and bill payments. 
We expanded our strategic partnership with Yandex in Russia and we'll be their preferred international partner for all of their fintech initiatives. And Finterra, an innovative market leader that connects U.S. banks and fintechs to get cards and financial products into the market, will leverage our digital-first Finicity, Mastercard Send and cybersecurity assets.  
Now shifting to services. Our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in enabling many of the wins I just mentioned. They, of course, also diversify our business. We had many wins in this area this quarter. 
Starting with the cybersecurity space. Ethoca is helping multiple players, including AT&T and Mercado Libre, reduce charge-backs through collaboration, thereby creating purchase transparency. Banco de Bogotá is using our artificial intelligence capabilities to improve consumer experiences, increase profitability and identify new opportunities. And in Europe, [indiscernible] is leveraging NuData's behavioral biometrics to help thousands of new banks authenticate online transactions.  
Data analytics. The tourism agencies in Greece, Hungary and elsewhere are using services like tourism insights and managed services to gather greater visibility of trends and drive deeper insights to support their tourism campaigns. In the UAE, HSBC is leveraging our Test & Learn capabilities to innovate, experiment and roll out new products for better customer engagement. And we're having success in the loyalty space with our innovative digital solutions, driving wins with players like the global fitness chain, Barry's and [indiscernible] and Saudi National Bank.  
Now let's turn to the progress we've made in offering choice to consumers across payment applications with our multi-rail capabilities, including open banking, B2B and crypto. In open banking, we're happy about our planned acquisition of Aiia. Aiia is a leading European open banking player, whose platform expertise, strong API connectivity and payment capabilities complement our existing open banking assets. We will combine Aiia's European footprint with Finicity's connectivity in the U.S. and our expansion into other markets like Australia. This will allow us to extend each organization's best-in-class capabilities, such as credit decisioning, credit scoring, account information services and payment applications across markets.  
Talking about markets. We continue to make progress with our open banking product in Europe with players like Entercard, one of Scandinavia's leading credit card companies. And in the U.S., Finicity is working with UGO to enable account opening verifications, along with future plans to expand into payments. In B2B, we continue to expand the Track Business Payment Service network with key partners like JPMorgan Chase as well as merchant acquirers such as Moneris, the largest acquirer and leading processor of B2B transactions in Canada, and Priority Commercial Payments, a leading payments technology company in commercial payment solutions in the U.S.  
We're also adding new functionality to Track DBS and are partnering with Demica to launch a supply chain finance capability. This functionality empowers payment agents to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital directly through the Mastercard Track DBS platform. And in the U.K., HSBC will be the first to issue a Mastercard Track Card to Account Transfer product, an innovative B2B payment solution that allows businesses to use their commercial card program to make payments to any supplier, even if that supplier does not accept card payments. Again, a true multi-rail offering. 
And finally, in the crypto space, we're making it easier for crypto players to connect to our network. We signed up a number of new crypto wallet providers and exchanges this quarter, including Bit2Me, [indiscernible], Kanga by ZEN.COM, Coinmotion and CoinJar. Our crypto program, which is based on [indiscernible] principles of engagement, allows consumers to easily buy crypto assets with their Mastercard, spend their crypto balances wherever Mastercard is accepted, cash out their proceeds with Mastercard Send and earn rewards in the form of crypto or even NFT. 
We're also seeing a growing services opportunity in this space. Earlier this month, we acquired CipherTrace, a security and fraud monitoring company with expertise, technologies and insights into more than 900 cryptocurrencies. Our recently announced agreement with Bakkt will also add to our expanding crypto services portfolio. 
So let me sum this up one more time. We delivered strong revenue, earnings growth this quarter. We are seeing continued strength in domestic spending in most markets. And while overall cross-border volumes are back at 2019 levels, there remains significant room for growth in cross-border travel. We're executing against our strategic priorities with good progress on the product and deal front, as you heard, we're doing all of that while carefully managing our expenses. 
That's it for me. Sachin, over to you."
6477196,1684902607,2416200,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was u",1360,"Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. 
Net revenue was up 29%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 45%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. 
Further, net income growth was also positively impacted by 6 ppt due to the recognition of higher one-time discrete U.S. tax benefits versus a year ago. EPS was up 48% year-over-year to $2.37, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $361 million through October 25, 2021. 
So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in both debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 20% with debit growth of 9% and credit growth of 36%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 20%, with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 16%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 121%, up 2 ppt sequentially, with credit at 111%, up 4 ppt sequentially, and debit at 131%, flat quarter-over-quarter. 
Cross-border volume was up 52% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 47% and other cross-border volumes up 60%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the pandemic last year. In the third quarter, cross-border volume was at 97% of 2019 levels with intra-Europe at 112% and other cross-border volume at 83% of 2019 levels. Notably, cross-border volumes averaged at or above 100% of 2019 levels in the months of August and September. 
Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 25% year-over-year in Q3 and were at 131% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remained strong and card-present growth continue to improve. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In Q3, contactless transactions represented 48% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 45% last quarter. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 29% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21% while worldwide GDV grew 20%. Cross-border volume fees increased 59% while cross-border volumes increased 52%. The 7 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. 
Transaction processing fees were up 26%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 25%. Other revenues were up 35%, including a 10 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 34%, reflecting the strong growth in volume of transactions and new and renewed deal activity. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 16%, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, including -- sorry, increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. 
Turning to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of October. We are seeing continued strength in growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we are once again showing 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, through the first 3 weeks of October, the recent trends have continued with overall switched volumes at 134% of 2019 levels, up 3 ppt versus Q3. The U.S. has held steady with some moderation in growth from earlier levels due to the roll-off of stimulus. And outside the U.S., we have seen continued improvement. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. 
In terms of cross-border, as I noted earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 were back to pre-pandemic levels, starting in August. That improving trend has continued through the first 3 weeks of October. And we are now at 105% of 2019 levels. This improvement is driven by increases in both travel and non-travel cross-border volumes. As it relates to travel, we have seen it picking up in all regions, notably within and to Europe and recently into Canada as well. 
Turning to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, our deal momentum and service lines continue to position us well for growth and diversify our revenues. And we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives. Domestic spending levels remain healthy. And we are encouraged by the recent resurgence in international travel. We are optimistic about the announced relaxation of border restrictions in places like the U.S. and the U.K., given that we have seen travel pickup when borders have opened in the past. Further, the airlines have recently reported increased travel bookings, including long-haul travel. 
With this as context, assuming domestic and cross-border spending trends relative to 2019 continue to improve, we would expect Q4 net revenues to grow at a low 20s rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, spending recovered progressively in 2020, so we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 7 ppt in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to the pandemic and therefore the pace of recovery may not be linear. 
In terms of operating expenses for the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of low double digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our innovation agenda across payments, services and promising new adjacencies and continued investment in brand and product marketing. 
With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to now have closed on the CipherTrace transaction. And we expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue and 8 ppt to operating expense growth in Q4. This reflects the integration of several acquisitions in the open banking, digital identity and real-time payment areas. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about 0.5 ppt headwind to both net revenue and operating expenses in Q4. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $120 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the fourth quarter. 
Thanks, and I hope you will be able to participate in our virtual investment community meeting on November 10. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

Let me take that question first. So buy-now-pay-later, exciting space. We talked about it for years, invested with our own installment proposition, facing off to banks 5, 6 years ago, the partnerships, and now as of late Mastercard Installments as you said. You saw a strong lineup of initial partners, bank partners initially. I mean, the thought is to remind everybody again here is a proposition that we have built into our network. So this is really delivered with no hassle for merchants or for lenders at the point of sale. 
So the reaction from banks are strong. Here in the U.S., that's where our lineup of U.S. partners, lending partners was. But I've spent time on the roads over the last 3 weeks in Europe and similar conversation emerged there. It was just a couple of days after the announcement over Italy and banks were saying, ""Wow, this makes a lot of sense. It's really avoiding a significant headache for us and get into a space that we all believe is important from a consumer perspective."" 
On the fintech side, fintech lenders, novel lenders, we lean in with fintechs, some call them disruptors. We feel these are partnerships, we should enable anybody who wants to come on our network. And we're certainly marketing this to ensure that we have the full breadth of what the market has in terms of lending offering. That's going to be good for consumers and merchants. So watch this space, more to come. But I think it's a very compelling proposition."

Choice in payments has been a theme for Mastercard now for, I think, basically always, but specifically with our investments in the account-to-account space over the last 6 years. So we see the demand from merchants and from consumers. For the consumer, it makes sense because you get all your spend into -- you can see it all on one bank account. That would be one aspect to why consumers might like that. Merchants like it for choice and higher baskets of more sales. 
So the interest is clearly there. We've been on this journey for a while, and we don't necessarily see this as a disintermediation opportunity. I mean, that's certainly something to watch. But we look at it as an opportunity. We say this could be additional volumes that we've not been involved with. This could be what was historically the consumer finance business. This would be something that was just the direct debit business that we've seen in some European countries and so forth. 
So that's broadly how we look at it. We built a full stack around this that helps to get your money from A to B. But that's just half of the story. Probably not even half of the story because it's the whole experience that really matters. You got to have the security. What happens if you do a push payment and you want your money back? Some of those best practices that we've learned over the last decades in cards is what we are intending to build here. 
So it's interesting to see blogs out there on how account-to-account might look like. We have 4 years now in Pay by Account in the U.K. We've got those learnings. We're ahead of the market here, very clearly knowing what works, what the economic model should look like, what the proposition that would really make a difference for merchants, for acquirers who will be all playing in this space. So I don't see a disintermediation risk. I see an opportunity for us to extend our partnerships and gain new flows."

And the cost of acceptance is very competitive. And when you take that, along with what Michael talked about around the various technologies and the expertise we bring, everything from digital solutions, fraud solutions, merchant support, processing assets, now most recently, Mastercard Installments, that's a very compelling proposition to go and look in our view, which is why we believe that if people wish to scale, the best way to go on is open loop, which is why we've kind of given investment in the business very heavily to drive down that back."

So Bryan, I'll go ahead and take that. First, I know you're asking specifically about cross-border travel, but I just want to kind of put the headline out there, which is for cross-border as a whole, we have seen very strong growth in Q3, as you've seen. And yes, travel has been a big component of that, specifically, travel between Q2 and Q3 has gone from what was 48% of 2019 levels to 72% in Q3. And now in the first 3 weeks of October is tracking more like at 77%. 
And look, what this signals to us very clearly is if people can travel, they will travel. And I think that's really, really important to recognize. And then when you overlay that with what's going on in the nature of announcements, around opening of borders, more specifically, the U.S. has recently talked about inbound travel into the U.S. In fact, I think just a couple of days ago, they laid out the actual details around how people can come into the U.S. 
I mean, you combine that with the fact that Europe has opened up, the U.K. is showing good signals of opening up. Even in Asia, we're starting to see corridors between Singapore and Australia, Singapore and India. These corridors are all starting to open up. These are all encouraging signs for us from a cross-border travel standpoint. And we remain optimistic on that front, especially given that if those borders open up and they come with what would be light burdens from a quarantining standpoint, which is what we are seeing right now. 
People have said that they will travel and they've demonstrated that through Q3. So net-net, here is what I'll tell you, I think travel is something which people want to do. They're showing their willingness to do it. Now it's a question of which are the other countries which will open up in addition to the borders I've just talked about. And you're reflecting -- you're seeing this to be reflected in the bookings, which airlines are reporting as well. So we remain optimistic on this front. I can't really tell you specifically which day or which month it's going to reach to 100% of 2019 levels. But generally, the trend is more moving in the right direction there."

And I think you know all of this, but I'll just kind of state it here. A few things, we think that incentives is very dependent on the timing of deals and how volume and mix plays out. And it goes to your point around what the mix is between domestic and cross-border and how you model that and bring that in there. In Q4, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially due to increased deal activity. This is pretty normal for us in Q4. And that's what you should expect also going into Q4 of this year. 
Look, at the end of the day, a lot is going to depend upon, like I said, what the mix is going to look like. We have said in the past that cross-border revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So again, depending on mix between domestic and cross-border, that will inform our kind of views around where rebates and incentives will go on a going-forward basis. Of course, new and renewed deals, which we remain very active in the market, are also going to be a contributing factor."

Why are we doing that? We're doing it because here's the 450 million consumers who cannot use a Mastercard -- a Maestro card online because it doesn't work online.

And then second question would be when you think of the structural impacts from the pandemic and where you are now and thinking ahead of the Investor Day a minute, I mean, is the long-term or medium-term growth potential similar, different, better, worse than it was last time we had an Investor Day, out of curiosity?"

So Darrin, I'll take your question on inflation.

So look, I mean, there's been obviously a lot of talk recently about high inflation levels, whether it's permanent, whether it's long term, whether it's just transitionary. The reality is the structure of our business model is quite conducive because of the way we price, right? I mean, we've got basis points. We've got cents per transaction as it relates to how we kind of price. 
So we kind of view the following, which is to the extent that inflation is moderate, right, we think that -- of that to be a positive tailwind kind of to our business. Again, gradual and moderate inflation is going to be helpful. And the reason I bring that up is any sort of shock to the economy, i.e., any sort of hyperinflationary event, oftentimes comes with drastic measures from an interest rate standpoint and comes with cost pressures which come along with that. So to the extent it's moderate, it's moderately kind of positive for our business. 
The other thing I would say is it's important to actually see in the basket of goods and services what are the products and services which are subject to inflation and what is the amount of electronification of the flows, which have taken place and relevance to our business. So to the extent there's inflation, general inflation taking place in categories which are unrelated to card payments, I mean, that kind of is a net nonevent for us. To the extent it's on things which relate to consumer spending, which have been electronified, it goes back to my point around moderate inflation being a mild positive here."

Now Darrin, on your second question, structural changes, are they here to last, what makes a trend? Fascinating question. I don't want to upfront the Investor Day, but since you asked the question, I'll give you a couple of highlights on how we're thinking about that. 
So the first thing is it helps to understand the psyche of the changing consumer of the small business, so everybody who's kind of in the payment space as an end user. And we now have 19 months of studies looking at this. And the numbers have really not changed. Somewhere around 70% of people and business are saying more digital banking will be what they will be doing going forward. More online shopping is what they will be doing going forward and more contactless. 
So the secular trend that was playing in our favor for years has clearly accelerated. And if you just look at this quarter's numbers, we talked about sustained e-commerce strength while in-person shopping is coming back. So behavior is truly sticking. So that is -- I think that's the most fundamental point that we're seeing coming through. The race to this digital economy is on. And what that also means is a lot of players want to come in. So there are structural changes in the sense of that the competitive playing field is opening up. 
More partners are coming in, which for B2B2C player like us is a great opportunity to facilitate the entry of all of these partners. So that's what we're doing. Then you start to look around and say, ""Well, who else is looking at this, these kind of trends and these kind of developments?"" Most notably governments. Governments are looking at this, and they have found that over the last 19 months, that payments is indeed a national critical infrastructure. So that comes with government engagement, which is not always necessarily positive. But what we're seeing is there's this real drive to modernize payment infrastructure. 
And that is where we are invited to the table because we're a true multi-rail network. And they're saying, ""Hey, you're locally invested, you're a locally relevant partner. Let's talk about how do we make this better in our country."" So that is certainly a structural change as in -- Tien-Tsin asked earlier about new payment flows coming in, open banking, et cetera, in Europe, so we're playing on all of those trends going forward. So I think that is what is happening. 
You could -- I could go on for a while longer. B2B, clearly digitizing supply chains is a drive that is in focus. We're seeing that. Data analytics and cybersecurity, that's the last point I want to make on this. With the race towards a more digital economy, there's going to be more data that is available, more business will seek to use that data and run their business in a better way, find more customers. 
Our Test & Learn capabilities and our data analytics capabilities help on that. So again, that's a structural trend that's helpful. And the same applies for cyber and security, more digital transactions need to be made safe, more people need to be authenticated as they use these tools. Again, that plays into our offering. So structural change is really driven by COVID accelerating the race to digital."

So the journey towards account-to-account in Europe, I think it's still early days. If you look at how PSD2 has rolled out in Europe, starting in September 2019, including the strong customer authentication, has been a long journey. Dates have been moved on multiple occasions to give time to the industry to get this right. 
And get right means that the transaction isn't so secure that nobody can use it any longer. So the tradeoff between consumer experience and security is actually found in a balanced way. And what we are seeing in our engagements in Europe is that balance is starting to be struck. So we will reach a point where such strong customer authentication in cards as well as in other forms of payments will be actually a reality in Europe. So that's the first thing I want to say. 
When it comes to open banking specifically, so there has been, over the last 2 years, really a focus on driving connectivity in Europe in terms of getting the open banking ecosystem stood up. That's exactly why we put out a connectivity product in June 2019. That was the first lead into the region, and we've been quite busy with that. Use cases emerging on the basis of that really started in 2020, the U.K. being ahead of Continental Europe on that while this was still one Europe. 
And U.K. is still pushing ahead. You heard us talk about Lloyd's on card repayments, about our partnership with Tesco. So the payment capability part of open banking is really leading in the U.K. And here, our proposition is very well positioned. So we start to see that. And I see the wave coming over to Continental Europe as connectivity is now there. 
Our acquisition of Aiia is perfectly timed here. We expect to close this by the end of the year to not bring in additional -- not only bring in additional connectivity but also additional payment capabilities. Because I do see this is not just a data capability, it's a big data -- kind of a data play, account obligation, personal finance management and so forth. But it's also a payment opportunity."

And we could not have an earnings call without talking about crypto, so I'm happy you brought it up. Looking at this from a number of perspectives, other than that there's a lot going on in the space. We are pretty clear on how we want to play in this. So the first is we see significant volumes in terms of people actually investing in crypto and selling crypto. 
So as an asset class, there's a lot going on. And I think we have a role to play to facilitate consumers wanting to do that if that's what they choose to do. So these partnership programs on exchanges, crypto exchanges and wallet partners and so forth, have been quite important for us and that is good from a volume perspective. There's real activity. 
When it comes to crypto as a payment tool, then we take a somewhat differentiated view on that versus the -- we just stepped into that. We're saying at this point in time, the most likely chance of this kind of technology to work for payments is issued through a government in the form of central bank digital currency. We've said that on a couple of calls before. And we said we will make our network ready to do that as and when a government is ready to put out a central bank digital currency, then it will exist alongside the dollar or the euro [indiscernible] currency in our network. So we've done that. 
But that's easily said. How will the government test that? How will a country figure out between the private sector banks and the government how to do this? That's where our sandbox comes in. So we can provide a safe space for government and private sector banks to figure out how that would actually work. Questions like the last mile, how do you bring utility into the hand of your citizens if you put out a central bank digital currency, acceptance questions and so forth. So facilitating investments as an asset class, we do that and we get ready for CBDC. Should there be a private sector stable coin, we might also do that. But we have very strict principles on when to do this and when not. 
Now let me talk about CipherTrace for a moment. Because this space is a really interesting space in so many ways. Questions on data privacy, questions on authentication, we just touched on that in the context of Europe and strong customer authentication. We have to expect the Europeans will say, ""Well, strong customer authentication will, of course, play a role in crypto transactions as well,"" which is where we always lead with security and trust. I mean, that is really synonymous with the name of Mastercard when it comes to payments that we have to do the same role. 
So it's na massive services opportunity. CipherTrace, 900 cryptocurrencies, what does CipherTrace actually do? They drive compliance and AML checks into crypto transactions. We can't run fast enough right now to get into the space because a lot of other people are deep into crypto and these questions are not resolved. So asset class, CBDCs and a services opportunity, those are the three ways that we feel we want to play and we need to play and we have the differentiated assets to do so."

So here's a blog post that describes the account-to-account. We have account-to-account technology really since the acquisition of Vocalink. And we've learned how that works. We like it because it's an additional choice that is provided to consumers and to merchants. But we also have all the learnings. And the learnings go around like how do you create acceptance into that? How do you make it easy for a merchant? How do you actually convince a consumer that actually likes the card proposition? 
So all of that, it is about standing up an ecosystem. So what we believe is this should be something that is built into our network, into our multi-rail capabilities, and it's actually how we're approaching it. So we're leaning into this.  I don't see it as a disruption. That's been our stated strategy. And we have 5 years of learnings. And I think that puts us ahead of the curve to make this a reality. I think this is a interesting alternative when it comes to consumer payments in store. And we have it. We build it. 
It's for us to really figure out whether the economics settle, what other capabilities that are currently built into our card franchise can we extend into the world of account-to-account payments, for example, charge-backs, those kind of data protection and so forth. So that's the direction that we're taking. Not really a disintermediation question, an interesting blog, the good things we've done in reality."

So we don't expect that the economic returns, which they will generate, should be any different, given that the value we delivered previously, if anything, has only gotten better over a period of time with more electronification of flows taking place. 
To your point around several other account-to-account capabilities, which are there in the cross-border space, the reality is we're participating in them today. But it happened to be going after flows, which are not carded flows. They're not point-of-sales flows. They happen to be more in the nature of business-to-business payments. We do that with our -- if you remember, we acquired a company called Transfast, in addition to the fact that we have our capabilities from HomeSend. The combined capability of that is our cross-border Send capabilities, which is account-to-account cross-border payments. 
And we'll participate in those flows, but those are separate and distinct from what goes on at the point of sale with our card products today. So net-net, I kind of view the whole cross-border space as a positive for us as and when travel comes back from a card standpoint.

So I think the answer to the first part of your question, I think you kind of touched upon on the second part of your question, which talks about how revenues are realized on cross-border is very much a function, even in that ex intra-Europe kind of category. It will depend on every corridor. Every corridor has got a different yields. And depending on which ones come back first, which ones come back after, the numbers from a cross-border revenue standpoint will kind of move around. 
As it relates to what we're seeing, look, I mean, I'll tell you pre pandemic, important corridors for Mastercard included obviously U.S. to Canada, the U.S. to the U.K., the U.K. to various parts in Continental Europe. These are all very important corridors. We've seen intra-Europe come back pretty nicely. The U.S. inbound is still to happen. I mean, there's a little bit happening, but there's more to come as borders open. Canada has started to open up. As you know, Canada opened up in the third quarter. We've seen signs of recovery take place in terms of inbound into Canada as well. 
And these are important corridors for our business. The one area which I will say is still a little bit kind of yet to be seen is Asia Pacific, right? In Asia Pacific, recovery in cross-border has still been kind of somewhat muted. We'll see how borders open up there and what that kind of shapes up to be. But net-net, here is what I'll tell you from a yield standpoint, intra-Europe, low-yielding, ex intra-Europe, high-yielding. In the ex intra-Europe bucket, the yields vary by corridors."

And we had kind of maintained that we think that there will be a reversion to the mean as economies come back and as discretionary spending picks up. 
And that's exactly what you're seeing right now, right? I mean, as people are spending more in discretionary categories, lodging, travel, restaurants, credit is definitely coming right back to the top of wallet. And we expect that as the economy continues to recover in different parts of the globe, that reversion to mean will continue. And that's kind of our view as it relates to how credit plays out over the near to medium term."

So here are highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral",1911,"Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On that same basis, quarter 2 net revenues are now 10% over 2019 levels even though international travel is in the early stages of recovery, which is showing the strength of our diversified revenue streams.  
The domestic switched volumes are well above pre-pandemic levels with all the regions growing in a healthy rate. We're seeing improvements in both domestic and cross-border travel with significant upside potential. Within this context, we're making progress against our strategic objectives and have expanded our relationships with key partners like Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Stripe and Verizon.  
Let's dive in, looking first at the broader economy. Domestic spending levels continue to show improved in-store sales and strength in e-commerce. According to our quarter 2 SpendingPulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales at auto, ex gas, were up 14% versus a year ago and up 10% versus 2019, reflecting improved consumer mobility and some residual effects of fiscal stimulus. SpendingPulse also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter 2 were up 13% versus a year ago and 6% versus 2019.  
The vaccine rollout has scaled in the U.S., U.K. and Germany and several other countries with over 35 countries now reporting that over 50% of their populations are at least partially vaccinated. Broadening this effort is critical and will of course take time.  
Turning to our business, specifically in the 4-phased framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. We believe that most markets are at a growth phase domestically as cross-border spend is now starting to normalize and border restrictions are being relaxed.  
Looking at Mastercard spending trends. Switched volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter, with strength across all products. Debit spend remains elevated, and we are seeing further recovery in credit, driven in part by the return of travel and increased discretionary spending. This recovery is led by consumer credit, but it's important to note that commercial credit is also improving and has now reached pre-pandemic levels as well. In terms of how people are spending, they are definitely getting out more as we're seeing improvement in card-present spending, particularly in the travel, retail and restaurant categories, while e-commerce continues to be strong.  
Now turning to cross-border. Proforma card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to be very strong. On the travel front itself, it is clear people want to travel and they do so where and when able to. We've seen this domestically and across borders where there are limited restrictions. For example, we're seeing strength between the U.S. and Latin America as well as an increase in travel within Europe. Our industry reports, there has been a recent increase in bookings for travel between the U.S. and Europe, and the quarantine requirements for entry into Canada are starting to be relaxed, so that's a further opportunity. Overall, we expect more borders to open in the second half of the year, depending, of course, on infection rates, including the recent variants and progress on the vaccination front.
Against this improving backdrop, we are focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our core products supported by our services; second, driving digital enablement, both in stores and online; third, ensuring the ecosystem is safe and secure; and fourth, providing choice through our multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long term by continuing to manage our expenses carefully.  
We'll look at them one by one. First off, we're driving growth in our core products and are leveraging our comprehensive services to do so, working with new and existing customers solve their pain points, both in payments and beyond. We're well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel and remain focused on building on our strength in this area by expanding relationships with our travel partners.  
For example, we have renewed our exclusive co-brand with JetBlue Airlines in the U.S. We also entered into a long-term global partnership with Cathay Pacific and Asia Miles, who will migrate their existing co-brand portfolio to Mastercard. In the Middle East, we have expanded our British Airways co-brand and in Latin America, we are now the preferred brand for LATAM Airlines. It is important to note that our services played a critical role in enabling all these deals, including our data analytics, Test & Learn, loyalty, consulting and cybersecurity solutions.  
Of course, we also continue to drive growth in the core outside of travel. Here are a few examples. We're excited about our partnership with Citi to launch the new Citi Custom Cash Mastercard, offering card members cash back in the top eligible spend category. JPMorgan Chase, we've extended and deepened our agreement in the commercial space, and we have renewed our Maestro brand relationship with Chase in the U.S. We also continue to partner closely with community banks throughout the U.S., including a flip of  First Southern National Bank's debit portfolio to become their exclusive network brand.  
On the digital front, we're well positioned to drive the acceleration of the secular shift with our digital capabilities no matter how consumers want to shop: in store, online or both. As consumers return to in-person shopping, adoption of contactless continues to grow. In the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 45% of in-person purchase transactions globally according to our switched transaction. That's up from 37% a year ago. At the same time, e-commerce continues its strong growth, and we are providing consumers choice on how they want to pay online. For example, Click to Pay, to improve the guest checkout experience, it's now rolled out in over 10 markets, and we continue to launch significant new merchants such as the Canadian Tire group.  
On to the buy-now-pay-later space. In Australia, we're partnering with Citi and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to offer installments to consumers wherever Mastercard is accepted. And whether in store or online, we are securing and streamlining the consumer experience through our tokenization services. Tokenized transactions across in-store, online and in apps surpassed 1 billion per month throughout the second quarter.  
We continue to partner with major digital players to expand the reach of our digital capabilities. For example, we just entered a strategic partnership with Stripe to give business a small control of the how they spend their money by enabling Stripe users to create, manage and distribute virtual and physical cards for small business, commercial and consumer across credit, debit and prepaid.  
We've also entered a partnership with Verizon to bring 5G innovation to the global payments industry. Leveraging our services and insights in pairing Mastercard solution with Verizon's 5G connectivity will allow us to create better experiences from the checkout lines to being billed, even through how businesses are run. The increased capacity and reduced latency of 5G will enable us to take another step towards making every device a commerce device.  
Now on to securing the ecosystem. As more merchants and consumers shift to digital, the importance of keeping the ecosystem safe and secure is paramount and is creating a strong demand for our cyber solutions. In addition to organic growth, a number of our acquisitions in the space continue to perform well.  
For example, Ethoca had strong deal momentum, including a fraud and dispute management agreement with EBANX, a payment solution provider operating across 15 countries in Latin America. RiskRecon, which monitors and then tests those customers' third-party cybersecurity risk, is now scanning millions of companies globally, up from thousands when we acquired them at the end of 2019. NuData is providing biometric fraud prevention tools to Major League Baseball and the neobank, Nickel. We're happy to advance our digital identity capabilities with the acquisition of Ekata that has now closed and off to a strong start on the deal front. 
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to our initiatives focused on addressing a broader set of payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. The key here is to provide choice, essentially the right tool for the job. With our multi-rail approach, including our expertise and capabilities in cards, real-time payments and support for digital currencies, we are able to deploy the right combination of assets to meet our customers' needs. And more than just having this range of capabilities, we're making these solutions work together seamlessly. Let me give you a few examples.  
In B2B, we're making progress with Mastercard Track building out our global open-loop network by working with buyer agents and supplier agents such as banks, software companies and ERP vendors. On the bank side, we're very excited to have signed Box e-card payments who will use Track to connect their global business customers on both the buyer and the supplier side of the ecosystem across multiple rails. We also signed FreshBooks, a premier accounting software platform with customers in over 100 countries. 
In the Bill Pay space, we continue to scale the Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange, which leverages our real-time payment capabilities to provide a transformative mobile-first experience to bill payments with Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions now connecting into the platform. 
In Mastercard Send, we continue to penetrate a variety of new payment flows beyond traditional card payments. These enabled dozens of use cases and hundreds of programs across every region of the world. For example, we're partnering with innovative digital messaging platforms to offer P2P services to consumers. Today, uses of WhatsApp in Brazil can transfer money directly in-app, leveraging Mastercard Send. We're also partnering with MoneyGram and Checkout to enable near real-time cross-border P2P transfers across Europe. And on the B2C front, we continue to support the fast-growing gig economy, and I'm partnering with Payfare to enable instant earnings payout to some of the largest gig platforms in the U.S. 
Through open banking, Mastercard is empowering people and businesses across the globe to easily and securely gain access to their financial data to create new opportunities for themselves. 
In the U.S., our efforts with Finicity are running ahead of expectations as we continue to enhance direct API connectivity for banks and fintechs. For example, we're partnering with Jack Henry to enable consumers back up more than 400 community financial institutions to use its digital platform to access, use and benefit from their own financial data. The Navy Federal Credit Union vis-à-vis signed direct data access agreements with Finicity. Finicity is also leveraging best-in-class data connections to launch new products in new verticals, such as its Mortgage Verification Service. 
Finally, in terms of cryptocurrency, we're making it easier for cryptocurrency wallets to connect seamlessly to our network through a pilot with Paxos, Circle and Evolve Bank & Trust, which simplifies the conversion of crypto into fiat. Separately, we're partnering with ConsenSys, the Ethereum software engineering firm, to accelerate the development of crypto applications and services to our customers. 
Now summing all this up. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, benefiting from our revenue diversification efforts. We believe that most markets are in the growth phase domestically and there's upside potential in cross-border travel. We're winning significant new deals, and we continue to focus on our strategic priorities to drive growth over the long term. 
Sachin, over to you."

Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting",1460,"Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. 
Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy amidst the strong recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34%, and net income was up 36%, both of which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. 
EPS was up 37% year-over-year to $1.95, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.7 billion worth of stock and an additional $398 million through July 26, 2021. 
So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 33% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 34% with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 50%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 32% with debit growth of 39% and a credit growth of 25%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes up 48% and other cross-border volumes up 71%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the debts of the pandemic last year. In the second quarter, cross-border volume was 87% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe almost back to even at 97% and other cross-border volume at 79% of 2019 levels. 
Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 41% year-over-year in Q2 and were at 127% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remain strong and card-present growth continued to improve, aided in part by increases in contactless penetration across every region. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 31% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 36%, while worldwide GDV growth was up 33%. The 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing and mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 60%, while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as cross-border volumes, ex intra-Europe, grew faster than intra-Europe volumes this quarter, partially offset by the lapping of elevated levels of return activity a year ago. 
Transaction processing fees were up 33%, while switched transactions were up 41%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily driven by the lapping of elevated return activity a year ago and adverse mix. 
Other revenues were up 32%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. 
Finally, rebates and incentives were up 49%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. 
Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. 
To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to once again present the 2021 volumes and transactions and the percentage of the 2019 amount when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. 
So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, the broad-based recovery continued through the second quarter and into July. Specifically, in the first 3 weeks of July, switched volume spend levels are at 130% of 2019 levels, which is a 9 ppt improvement over Q1. We are seeing a further recovery in card-present spending with improvements in travel-related categories, including lodging and restaurants. Also, in the U.S., we have seen consumer airline spend improve significantly since the early part of Q2, with volumes now back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing a switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 show an improving travel trend. Cross-border travel, which includes both card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes increased from 39% to 66% of 2019 levels from April to July, primarily driven by strength in Europe and between the U.S. and Latin America. Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. 
Cross-border card-not-present, ex travel, continues to grow at a healthy rate above pre-pandemic levels. This has moderated recently relative to 2019 levels in part due to a reduced contribution from the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the lapping of significant e-comm promotional activity in 2019. 
Turning now to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and are well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we continue to sign. Domestic spending levels are showing healthy growth, and we are well positioned for the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. Further, our service lines continue to grow at a healthy rate. 
Turning to the third quarter. The spending levels continue to improve along their current trajectory. We would expect Q3 net revenues to grow at the high end of mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, Q2 2020 marked the low point of the pandemic from a spending standpoint with some recovery in the following quarter. So we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 3 ppt in the third quarter. 
It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to new COVID variant and the progress of vaccinations and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. 
In terms of operating expenses, we will continue our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our strategic objectives in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our material solutions, including related brand and product marketing investments. 
For Q3, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of mid-teens rate versus the year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are lapping the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic developed. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have closed on the transaction with Ekata earlier than expected and expect the acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in both Q3 and Q4 as we integrate several acquisitions in promising new growth areas such as open banking, digital identity and real-time payments. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year, after which time we do not split them out. 
Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 1 to 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q3. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. 
And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business and improvement over previous expectation due to some discrete tax benefits realized in Q2. 
One last point, I wanted to let you know that we are planning an investment community meeting for the fall in New York. We are planning a cyber event on November 10, and we look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren."

Look, the reality is we're running the business for the long term. We're trying to drive long-term revenue growth and at the same time, long-term bottom line growth. And we'll do this in a disciplined manner. We have demonstrated over the period of the pandemic that we have sufficient flexibility in our expense base to actually make sure that we continue to execute on our strategic growth objectives and at the same time, keep an eye on how we're seeing the top line come around. 
So I guess my point to you is the following, which is we will continue to do what's right for the business to drive long-term growth by investing in key strategic areas, both organic and inorganic. And that's kind of where we are. In terms of the specifics on the numbers, it's what I just shared with you.

6477196,1673716282,2989125,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question. Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here,",619,"Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question. Very important topic. It's obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said there's broadly 3 different categories that are at play here, which is the Central Bank digital currencies and there's private sector stablecoins and there is a floating cryptos. 
So we told you that we want to be playing a role across all of them. We also said that -- in the first quarter call that as far as stablecoins are concerned, we are getting ready to technologically enable our network to carry these stablecoins as settlement currencies provided they meet one of our -- all 3 of our criteria, which is regulatory compliance, consumer protection and stability. So none of that has changed. 
Let me just give you a view on what has happened since we had that conversation. So on the Central Bank digital currency front, things are definitely continuing to move forward. You see a lot of central banks engaged on the topic. The ECB has just recently announced that they will actually move forward with the digital euro after a period of industry consultation. 
The Bank of England is in its period of industry engagement at this point right now. So there is clear progress. What is our value proposition to central banks and the government in this space is, first of all, we bring a unique perspective to the market as -- to these players as a multi-rail provider because all these countries have to make the trade-off, what is my existing financial system delivering my existing financial infrastructure and what else is the Central Bank digital currency solving for. Everybody has different motivations ranging from financial inclusion to cross-border payments and hence, we're a sought-after party because we have experience in all of that. 
I think a particularly critical proposition here is our virtual test platform because all of these design choices that governments have to make and that we consult them on, we then have to live in the wild, so to say. They've got to work with the existing financial infrastructure, and that's what our virtual test platform does for them. So that's the proposition at this stage for central banks. 
On the private sector stablecoins, nothing much different other than us engaging with private sector players as well as regulators on what does good policy look like around private sector stablecoins because this question about regulatory compliance is still unresolved. The regulators do need to weigh in and we're a part of that dialogue. 
On floating cryptos, here, the point of currency stability is not solved. So we won't be enabling that as settlement currency on our network. But clearly, people want to invest in that. They don't want to sell their investments, and we're going to make this as easy as possible. So we have all these partnerships out there. 
Now here's the thing with our announcement last week. And that is that in digital currency wallets out there oftentimes prefer to stay in crypto as these transactions are like selling and buying of investment. And here's where our partnerships, for example, with Paxos come in. It is our partner that allows these digital wallet to stay in crypto as they settle with Paxos and then Paxos settles with us in fiat. That's an interim step for us and when we reach the point that we might be enabling stablecoins on our network itself. 
So that's kind of where we are, playing a role across the board. This is a relevant technology. As a multi-rail player, we got to be in this space because people are looking for answers."

So the first thing I should say is our commercial business is there. It's coming back. Commercial travel is coming back, as I noted earlier in my comments. So here the focus is on small business, virtual card. And in the B2B space, specifically virtual card solutions, for example, on online travel agencies. So all that is continuing, but it's worth noting, we gave you a number some time back and in 2020, this was 11% of our GDV and that is what we're happy about that. 
Now when it comes to B2B very specifically, the multifaceted approach I talked you through earlier across Bill Pay, Track and the whole list that I talked about. Here, I see that if I take Bill Pay today, if you look at the fact that we have a quarter of all bills being paid addressable at 1/3 of the billers, so that gives us real scale. So I think we have come to a point of scalability here with the right kind of players. 
Last quarter, we added Verizon as a biller to the mix. So that is encouraging. We haven't given specific numbers and we haven't done it this quarter yet, but we really see that's going in the right direction. 
And with Nets coming in, we have a significant footprint in Europe. They run a scaled Bill Pay business over there. So when the time is right, we will share some numbers around that. 
Now at B2B, specifically Track, the excitement around a large bank like Barclays joining the Track ecosystem is great. We've fine-tuned our go-to-market with ERP and software providers. So the rollout here is progressing well with the right -- with both sides, buyer and supplier and buyer and supplier agents. Again, we haven't given numbers yet, but it would be what you would expect when you build a 2-side network. We're starting to have players on both sides. We can start to connect the corridors. So the value proposition of Track, a data switch, a payment optimization engine and the choice in multi-rail payments is really starting to get a hold. We said to you a couple of times, this has been -- this is going to be a multi-rail journey. 
COVID, while there was a realization that B2B supply chains have been affected by COVID and there's a desire to digitize, it wasn't exactly top-of-mind through COVID. So we're starting to see this interest coming back. 
So that's kind of where we are. And Sachin, you have anything to add?"

I'll just make one more point which is, as we think about B2B, we also think about it from a segment approach, right? What is the micro kind of business environment, small business environment, mid-market and then large corporates? And when you actually dissect along those lines, you will see that there's a significant amount of spend which takes place across the micro and small business space. And if you further break that down, you will see that there is a significant amount of that spend which takes place in cash. 
So the only point I'm kind of trying to make is that the value prop of the card rails in B2B still stands and stands pretty strong to displace cash, much like it has in the consumer space. And there's a tremendous opportunity for digitalization to continue down that path there as well. 
So I know we talked a lot about the accounts payable flow, and I think that's super important, but we certainly internally are not losing sight of the fact that a significant amount of cash spend, which still takes place where the value prop of card stands good."

So let me take the last one with kind of like a bit of a cheeky response. I think you will just have to tune in, Craig, to find out if we're going to give a 3-year guidance or a longer-term guidance at the time. 
On interchange, so complex topic for sure and the new administration is looking at various regulatory and lawmaking initiatives. As we all know, we've just seen the news develop yesterday. Now from the outset, we've leaned in with the new administration. We built a really positive relationship. So that is very good. And we're continuing, obviously, the same kind of interaction and engagement on a topic as important as interchange to our industry with lawmakers on the Hill, House and Senate, both sides of the aisle. 
We're monitoring this very closely. There is chatter here and there on interchange. The topic that's always been focused by different parties. What I would say is we've had the benefit of now having many years of playing -- seeing the interchange regulation on debit play out. There's enough data for us out there to say that really what it was intended to do, we can't really see it. Cost for consumers have gone up and benefits have been reduced. We keep providing that data to lawmakers and other interested parties and figures what the facts are stating. 
Now when it comes to interchange regulation applied to credit, you would expect the same in terms of cost impact, in terms of benefits impact, but there is another aspect here, that is the access to credit. You should assume that the access to credit for middle-class Americans is going to be impacted and not in a positive way if this interchange regulation comes in. So it is all something that needs to be thought through very carefully. 
What are the puts and takes? Why does this make sense? And that's the dialogue that we're leaning in. The good thing is we've seen this play out in many other markets around the world and have some experience with that and can then bring to the table as well. So that's kind of where we are, closely monitoring."

So really, I will preface by saying the following, which is, again, it's -- the uncertainty in the environment prevails given all these variants, which are kind of showing up. But the reality is the following, which is it has been clearly demonstrated that people want to travel and they do so when they're able to travel. And that's been shown in the domestic environment, and that's being now shown in the cross-border environment. 
So one of the things which is something which we very closely track is how is it that booking levels are taking place? What's kind of that trajectory of spend looking like or that trajectory of kind of data looking like? And then which are the corridors which are opening up based on -- for example, earlier this week, there was some dialogue around how the U.K. is going to open up to vaccinated people coming from the U.S. and from other countries. 
So the reality is the following, which is the data as we've seen it is what we've shared with you through the first 3 weeks of July. We are positive in terms of our sentiment as we progress through the second half of the year that as people get more vaccinated, more corridors will open up. And as more corridors open up, people will exercise their ability to travel because they have the intent to travel. And this is really, really important because as I look at what's going on across the globe, you could see that the U.S. and Latin America, which has the ability to travel with more borders being opened, people are exercising that and they're showing that come through. 
Similarly, now we're hearing about Canada opening up, which will be, again, something, which is encouraging from our perspective in terms of how people play that out. 
Asia, on the other hand, is still, I would say, at a pretty kind of subdued level just because of the reality of the situation in Asia, being what it is with the variants now actually getting to higher levels in certain countries in Asia. So look, hard to predict. But longer term, I guess, when I kind of look through all of this, what we feel encouraged about is that the vibrancy of travel is something which will come back. And most importantly, we are very well positioned to capitalize on that and when it does come back."

As what we've seen with Canada and the U.K., there's a whole stack of people that are vaccinated and want to travel. And until you come to the point of who else is not vaccinated, there's a long runway for us for -- this to play out.

So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time is going to level out. I think you're right. Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that.

Once you've caught up time and met everybody again, we're going to come to back of that. But there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly on commercial travel. We'll see how that will play out. 
It's interesting. When you look over the last 2 quarters, we see continued elevated levels of digital e-commerce spend, but we see in-store coming back. So there is not a net-zero game going on. I think this is actually really generally secular trend against cash and that is going to continue to run for a very long time. So it's good to have these 2 legs to stand on from our business model. I think that will remain. 
You'll see some of the e-commerce going to reduce over time, but I don't think we will go back to the levels that we had before the pandemic because people would have learned better experiences and they will like continue with that. I think every bit of consumer research that we do tells us that. And by the way, this is not just for online shopping, it's for digital banking and for contactless. It's for everything across the board. Generally, between 60% and 70% of people that we asked, and we ask them every month, say exactly that. 
With this push towards a more digital world, more data that needs to be kept safe, so I see that the path for our cybersecurity solutions is a very clear one and a very good one, and we will not see a reversion to something there before because you have the elevated driver of more digital just out there driving that business. And frankly, that's the same for data and analytics. 
Data analytics, again, more data, people want to understand it. But back to what Sachin was talking about on small business, here's a bunch of players that have traditionally maybe not used tools like that, understanding and managing their business through data and analytics. But now they can. So there's a whole new segment that's opening up that will -- we would like to serve through our partners in terms of real insights in how do you run a business online from whatever you might have been doing in the brick-and-mortar space before. So I think those are structural changes that are here to last. 
Cross-border, I don't think it's going to be something dramatically structurally changing. That's really the -- well, cross-border e-commerce. I think that is -- that's, again, people would have figured out that this does actually work. It couldn't go anywhere. They were using cross-border e-commerce platforms and tools, and I think that will continue. 
One more thing that comes to mind structurally is the heightened and elevated interest of governments and electronic payments and digital payments. That has started last year. Again, that was driven by the prices initially. ""How do I get my stimulus payments out,"" to now a conversation, ""Wow, this is an interesting space and I found that my infrastructure is dated. I need to partner with people."" 
So that is something that I see fundamentally as an opportunity, but it's important to engage with government as a fair partner and see that local footprint, and things like that do matter and that is -- we are well positioned with our multi-rail infrastructure to do exactly that. 
So there's a few things that come to mind. Back to Lisa's earlier question on B2B, I think this continued interest in digitizing B2B supply chains and B2B payments, that will also play out and grow over time over the next 2, 3 years."

Verizon, an entirely different strategic partnership. But here's another network, but a 5G network. We said, what could we do? Back -- we've talked about SME on this call in a couple of occasions now. Think about an SME that today has a card terminal and how they're going to compete with the marketplace. This is a -- if you imagine for a moment, you have a full Internet connectivity with not much infrastructure that you need to bring in, and then you can provide a true omnichannel experience, even the smallest business can do that. That is what 5G can deliver at any endpoint, anywhere at any situation. And that is the vision that Verizon, Hans and his team and our folks that we have developed. This is very specific. We've been on it for a while and we're expecting to make a real difference there. 
So 2 different types of strategic partnerships. I think they both matter, come back to the point that it's -- for us, it's about providing choice and payments to and anyone out there that is transacting in payments."

So a couple of things kind of to point out on that line item, really. At the end of the day, there are things which are, I would call, episodic, which took place in the months of April and June, and there's volatility in the price of crypto. There's more purchases which took place there. And then as the price came down, then you had the inverse effect of that taking place. 
So the reality is that, to us, kind of is one of those things which will remain volatile. And I say that only because I don't know where the price is going to go and how people are going to exercise their choice to purchase crypto on a going-forward basis. What I will tell you is we've seen a decent level of deceleration take place in how people are utilizing Mastercard products to purchase these digital currencies like crypto over the last 3 weeks as reflected in the numbers. So that's kind of one of the factors which influenced that. 
The second being just a tougher comp where the timing of that e-comm promotional activity which took place in 2019 happened to be in the first 3 weeks of July. So the comp is a tougher comp here. So that I don't view as something which is on a going-forward basis is going to be impacting what the so-called index growth rate is for this line item, 2021 versus 2019. Suffice it to say the following, which is the trend towards digital continues. It's true in domestic. It's true in cross-border. And the fact that, that is a positive feel, going back to what Michael just talked about in terms of structural changes is something we are well positioned to actually keep participating in as the economies evolve and things start to open up in different parts of the globe. So that's what I'd like to share with you on that one."

In the second quarter, the cross-border volume growth ex intra-Europe was a really good proxy for your overall cross-border revenue growth. So I mean, just hypothetically, if July month-to-date trends hold for these volumes through the rest of Q3, it would seem like cross-border revenue growth could approach 60% this quarter. So I just wanted to see if that's a fair characterization or if there's any other moving parts we should be aware of? And then if you can just give us some quick comments on Q3, Q4 rebates, that would be great."

So on cross-border, Jason, mentioning nicely that, look, you're aware about the fact that intra-Europe cross-border is low yielding than all other cross-border. And I think that's one thing to keep in mind because growth rates across those populations of spend will determine what revenue growth rate ultimately looks like. 
The reality is in the second quarter, we had a tougher comp from an elevated level of returns that we had seen in last year, which had the impact of subduing our cross-border volume fee growth rate some in this second quarter. And again, it's not like those returns and elevated revenues of returns only took place in the second quarter of last year. As the pandemic hit, people start to make cancellations in terms of their airline bookings, their hotel bookings, and that kind of -- while it tapered, it still occurred going into the third quarter as well. So just something to keep in mind as to what the puts and takes are when you're thinking about growth rates. 
On rebates and incentives, here's what I would tell you. I think you're very well aware about the focus of the company on making sure we are setting ourselves up to quickly win market share, and winning market share comes through creating fantastic value propositions and then delivering them at great value to our customers, which is where the rebates and incentives come into play. 
So we continue to do that, and we will continue to do new and renew deals, which will have an impact on rebates and incentives. So the one point -- the one more piece of information I'll share with you is that as it relates to Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be generally in line with what we saw in Q2. That's the extent of what I'm going to share with you in terms of where I kind of see in term of this playing out. Obviously, the mix of volumes impact that line item as well."

I wonder if you could compare and contrast what Mastercard is doing versus some of the sort of purpose-built risk and fraud products in the market. You have different channels, different capabilities, kind of how you coexist and compete with some of those independent providers. I'm thinking like a risk of 5, for example."

Right. Thanks, Andrew. Great question. So if you look at our services portfolio to start with, we try to seek an entry point as the sweet spot, leveraging our footprint and payments and our data and then have the technological capabilities and the talent and all of that coming together to a differentiated proposition. So you'll rarely see us compete with other services player on a pure play that has nothing to do with our position in payments. So that's the starting point of our strategy. And we're looking for adjacencies that just leverage our core competencies. 
Now when it comes to the cyber solutions, if I think about a product like Decision Intelligence, which basically helps our customers to make -- decide what's a good decision and what is not a good decision, it is exactly at the sweet spot of everything that I said. It's the transaction data. It's the availability of having this in real time in our system available and then using state-of-the-art AI to make the decisions for our customers. 
So here, I think we have -- from a competitive landscape perspective, a real leg up versus pure plays. Similarly in loyalty, we're one of the largest loyalty players in the world. They are pure plays, but the fact that we see all the transaction flow and we can look at aggregated anonymized data of look-alikes and what they are interested in and how their preferences go in terms of rewards, offers, managed programs and so forth, again, puts us in a differentiated proposition. 
You'd go -- but you see us building out our proposition in cyber coming back to that, looking at the whole value chain. Decision Intelligence about the transaction before the transaction, what we're now doing with Ekata and saying it's the foundational element. So here we go in. Ekata, in itself, has a set of data that allows us in real time to help a customer -- one of our customers decide if this account opening request is a good one or a bad one. There's a very high confidence score. That customer is obviously then interested in working with us on the downstream through the whole value chain of the transaction and other cybersecurity solutions, all the way to fulfillment, against, say, is that address actually a real address? So is this somebody that is just ordering something in somebody else's name. 
So that's how we're thinking about it holistically and leveraging our footprint in payments."

Great point. So open banking, an important trend. What we really like is this whole concept of putting power into the hand of the individual using their own data to get a better choice in services, the financial services and other services eventually. So we like that. 
We've been active in Europe for 3 years now -- 2 years now. We went live in summer 2019 over there. Good momentum. You heard us talk about Tesco and Lloyd's in the U.K., set up use cases that are now live. So happy about that. Good footprint over there. 
And in here in Finicity, that was a real kick for us in closing that transaction in November last year. And the Finicity team, first of all, they're deep in permission API, in the invention of the FDX standards. So they live and breathe open banking, and that was really critical for us as a player here in the U.S., great incumbent in the market. 
Now what is going better than expectations? I see a lot of momentum in engaging with banks. They have best-in-class data, data connections and they had a best footprint in banks, but we're -- now that as everybody else is looking at that and said, let's connect with Finicity. But we also see progress on the fintech side because this is an ecosystem that works on both sides. 
So we're excited about that. They had an interesting set of solutions today, that account verification, credit decisioning assistance. And now with the mortgage verification service, we're starting to build out at the same time, although driving -- on the deal front, we're also expanding the product set by bringing our data together with their data and our tech talent with their tech talent. So on every dimension, really around Finicity, we're quite happy that we have a connection.
All right. Good. I think that brings us to the end of our time. I gave you a summary of a quarter just earlier on, so I'm not just going to repeat that again. I just want to thank you for all your support all throughout and looking forward to speaking to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much and goodbye."
