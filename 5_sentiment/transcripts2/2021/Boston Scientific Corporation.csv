Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier",462,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2020 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. 
Duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Michael focuses comments on Q4 performance, inclusive of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q1 and fiscal year 2021 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q1 and fiscal '21 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. 
During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan was joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including Vertiflex through June and BTG through August 15, as there are no prior period related net sales, as well as the divestitures of the global embolic microspheres portfolio and the Intrauterine Health franchise. 
Guidance excludes the recently announced Preventives acquisition and assumes an April 1 divestiture of the BTG Specialty Pharmaceutical business. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Average daily sales normalizes sales growth for a difference in selling days year-over-year. Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8%, excluding COVID, represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments."

Thanks for joining us today. As we finish up the challenging 2020, I'm very proud of how the BSC team has responded and how we're able to serve patients while keeping our employees safe and leveraging this year's challenges into a strengthening of our portfolio and digital capabilities. We're excited about the outlook in 2021 and beyond and expect to return to growth, supported by our category leadership positions, innovative pipeline and ongoing expansion into higher growth markets. 
We are well positioned to emerge in the headwinds of the pandemic in a strengthened position given our innovative and diversified portfolio and our global team. As we preannounced on January 12, Q4 2020 sales declined 8% on an organic basis, which included 370 basis points of negative impact from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the U.S. 
Organic sales, excluding the impact of this WATCHMAN consignment, grew low single digits in October, down low single digits in November and then declined low double digits in December as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified in the Europe and the U.S. in particular. 
Our fourth quarter sales results were largely consistent with our third quarter '20 results, which declined 6% organically which included a 230 basis point impact from WATCHMAN consignment. For the full year 2020, operational sales declined 7.8%, and organic sales declined 11.3%, both of which include the 170 basis point impact from WATCHMAN. 
Today, we also announced Q4 adjusted operating margin of 18.3% and adjusted EPS of $0.23, which includes approximately 730 basis points and $0.13 of charges, respectively, related to WATCHMAN consignment and LOTUS Edge discontinuation. Importantly, we do not expect any material charges related to WATCHMAN consignment or LOTUS in 2021. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was 19.3%, with adjusted EPS of $0.96, reflecting the impact of reduced procedure volume due to COVID, as well as the impact from the shift to WATCHMAN consignment and LOTUS. 
Full year 2020 cash flow was strong despite the COVID impact at $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow with free cash flow at $1.1 billion. Our 2020 financials are clearly a negative outlier to our pre-pandemic 6-year track record of excellent results. We believe we will return to delivering strong results in 2021, thanks to our strategy of category leadership in key markets, portfolio diversification into high-growth adjacencies. 
We continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives and drive towards ex COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic sales growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth with improved ability to deploy our healthy free cash flow. We're excited to turn the page in 2020 and confident in our plans to build on our global momentum in '21 and beyond. We are reinstating guidance for Q1 and 2021 full year, which is based on our underlying COVID impact assumptions. 
These assumptions reflect an ongoing meaningful impact from the pandemic in first quarter, improvement in second quarter and a return to more normal procedure levels in second half '21. Our guidance also excludes the recently announced Preventice acquisition and assumes an April 1 divestiture of the BTG Spec Pharma business. 
We're targeting 2021 organic revenue growth of 12% to 18% versus 2020, and flat to up 5% versus 2019, both excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and Dan will give more details. Given the expected waning impact of COVID-19, we expect to see organic revenue accelerate over the course of the year, and we're guiding to full year adjusted EPS of $1.50 to $1.60. For Q1 '21, sales trends in January continued to be challenging due to the impact of COVID. However, we anticipate that our sales trends will improve throughout Q1 as COVID trends stabilize and vaccine access improves. 
As a result, we forecast first quarter '21 organic revenue in a range of down 3% to up 3% versus 2020 and down 6% to flat versus 2019, both excluding the impact of acquisitions, with adjusted EPS of $0.28 to $0.34. 
I'll now provide some brief highlights of Q4 and 2020 results along with thoughts on our 21 outlook. So returning back to Q4. Regionally, the U.S. is down 9% on an operational basis, inclusive of the 600 basis point WATCHMAN impact. Both Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pac were also down 6% operationally. Operationally, emerging sales -- emerging market sales declined 9%, and China was down 7%. China results include a 10% point negative impact from the DES tender sales return reserves. 
Outside this impact, China had excellent sales in IC imaging, complex coronary, PI, structural heart, urology, pelvic health, and we expect double-digit growth from China in 2021, given the momentum in these franchises, the diversification of our portfolio and with drug-eluting stents now representing approximately 5% of our China revenue mix in 2021. 
I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology and Public Health sales grew 1% on an organic basis in the quarter, normalizing for the Intrauterine Health divestiture. Full year sales declined 7%, and Q4 growth was led by continued strength in LithoVue, SpaceOAR and Rezum. In Q4, LithoVue grew double digits and crossed the threshold of treating 200,000 patients cumulatively. We recently launched SpaceOAR Hydrogel, which is visible under CT imaging and helped drive full year growth for that franchise north of 20% versus 2019. 
And for Endoscopy, Q4 sales also grew 1% with a broad-based recovery across regions and notable strength in infection prevention. Full year 2020 sales declined 6%. Our EXALT-D launch has received a strong physician feedback, and we continue to expand our global account base. Unfortunately, hospital systems during has COVID-19 restrictions have made adoption of EXALT-D more challenging. We do expect EXALT-D to build momentum throughout 2021 and remain bullish on the significant multiyear runway, but the pandemic continues to be a short-term headwind in driving EXALT-D access. 
We will also continue to build a body of clinical evidence and are very encouraged by uptake of the transitional pass-through payment for EXALT-D in the outpatient setting. The launch of Spyglass Discover continues to go well, and we continue to target launch of our single-use bronchoscope in the second half of 2021. We're also pleased to have recently launched the RISE Pro Knife, which complements our high-growth endoluminal surgery portfolio. 
In Cardiac Rhythm management, Q4 sales declined 6% with both high and low-voltage performance similar to overall CRM. Full year sales declined 12%. In 2021, we anticipate beginning enrollment soon in modular ATP our dual-track clinical study for a stand-alone levels pacemaker as well as provide antitachycardia pacing to Emblem S-ICD patients. Our high-voltage business is now nearly 3x the size of our low voltage business, so increasing access to Emblem S-ICD for appropriate patient populations is a significant driver for this leadless pacemaker work. 
Importantly, our Lux Dx implantable cardiac monitor is off to an excellent launch given this high-quality ECG signals, arrhythmia algorithm performance and streamlined back end monitoring. We're also excited about our recent acquisition of Preventice Solutions, which grew 30% in 2020 and to $158 million by offering best-in-class detection algorithms, a broad portfolio with Bodyguardian Mini that covers all core modalities of ambulatory ECG monitoring and establishes a strong position for BSC in the field of cardiac diagnostics. We expect to close the deal by mid '21, after which we'll be uniquely positioned across all diagnostic therapies, including AECG and Lux Dx, our plantable cardiac monitor, and Heartlogic as well as implantable and ablative therapies. 
Electrophysiology sales were down 2% in Q4 and 14% for the full year. In December, we did begin the full launch of POLARx, the second-generation single-shot cryoablation catheter in Europe, and physicians are noting POLARx ease of use and attractive procedure duration. StablePoint, our novel forceps in therapeutic catheter with DIRECTSENSE, was also recently approved in Japan and is receiving positive EU position feedback early in the commercial launch. 
In Neuromodulation, Q4 organic revenue declined 12%, but grew sequentially from Q3, while full year neuromod sales were down 16%. The fourth quarter decline was primarily due to a high rate of spinal cord stimulation patient cancellations in November and December due to the COVID surge. We expect the majority of these procedures to be rescheduled and are pleased to have launched our next-generation WaveWriter Alpha SCS system at NANS last month. 
Alpha offers fast and contour [indiscernible] waveforms with MRI capability supported by our Cognita Software Solutions that enhance the physician's ability to identify, manage and maintain SCS patients. We also recently received U.S. approval of our Vercise Genus platform, which expands our MRI capabilities in both the rechargeable and nonrechargeable segments, with Bluetooth communication between the implant, the patient remote and the physician programmer. 
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. Q4 sales declined 23% organically, but that includes an approximate negative 1,600 basis point impact related to the transition to WATCHMAN consignment and for the China tender reserve. Full year IC sales were down 18%, including a 720 basis point impact related to the same reserve items. The WATCHMAN franchise accelerated its recovery in Q4 with 18% growth excluding the impact of the WATCHMAN consignment. Our U.S. launch of WATCHMAN FLX has gone extremely well with positive physician feedback and device performance and safety in a higher-than-expected conversion rate in the shift of consignment model. 
This program to shift has not concluded, and we target a complete conversion to FLX by mid-2021. We're also continuing to invest in clinical trials to expand the patient indication for WATCHMAN FLX. We expect to complete enrollment of the OPTION trial by year-end. 
Within Coronary Therapies, we continue to improve our sales mix each year via the growth and innovation of our complex PCI franchise. Although drug-eluting expense continues to be a challenge from a pricing standpoint, DES now represents 7% of total company sales in 2020. And we continue to differentiate with new product launches, such as SYNERGY XD and 48-millimeter, as well as the newly approved MEGATRON in the U.S. 
Our complex PCI portfolio is an important growth driver with new products such as AVVIGO and NextGen Rotor Pro. We expect our global PCI and Imaging franchise to be 50% larger than DES in 2021. In TAVR, ACRA neo2 is performing very well in Europe, given its excellent ease of use, low rates of PVL and best-in-class pacemaker rates and hemodynamics. We continue to focus on the neo2 U.S. IDE enrollment. And in mitral later this year, we'll begin an early feasibility study in the U.S. for Millipede, a transcatheter angioplasty ring system for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. 
In Peripheral Interventions, Q4 organic sales grew 5%, which was an acceleration from Q3 and reflect an overall mix of high acuity as well as category-leading portfolio and a broad cadence of new product launches. Full year PI sales declined 3%, and the BTG Interventional medicine business grew 12% in the quarter, led by high-teens growth in EKOS and a new console, new reimbursement and market penetration into pulmonary embolism. We continue to have best-in-class clinical evidence of our EKOS system will add to our breadth and research with anticipation of high [ Petra ] trial, the first global head-to-head study of interventional therapy for pulmonary embolism compared to standard anticoagulation. 
In Arterial, our drug-eluting portfolio grew mid-20s as we launched the Ranger DCB in the U.S. and saw uptake of the NTAP for Eluvia. And the market continues to cover as additional long-term data sets continue to show no mortality risk associated with paclitaxel devices. Now we expect our drug-eluting portfolio to exceed $150 million in 2021. 
I'd also like to highlight briefly 2 important sustainability accomplishments this quarter, inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the News Week's America's Most Responsible Company to 2021 list. These recognitions are a gratifying reflection of our commitment to sustainable, economic, environmental and social practices. So overall, we're very optimistic on the outlook for 2021 and beyond. The high acuity nature of our portfolio, multiple product launches and a diminishing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic should all help BSE to execute well and significantly improve performance in '21. 
We will continue to execute our category leadership strategy and diversify the portfolio into high-growth markets like the Preventice acquisition, which is expected to add exciting growth diagnostics platform with excellent long-term prospects. This deal is the latest example of our strength in balance sheet and compelling venture portfolio, which enable to continue to develop multiple high-growth market opportunities. In addition, the excellent work of our health care economics and reg teams in 2020 led to multiple product approvals and reimbursement wins. That also positions us well to go forward. 
We continue to drive towards ex COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic revenue growth and margin expansion to drive strong cash flow and double-digit adjusted EPS. And finally, we continue to live our values with enduring commitment to sustainable business practices. I'm grateful to our employees and for their winning spirit, and now I'll turn things over to Dan."

Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.78 billion represents a reported revenue decline of 6.8% and reflects a $44 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue declined 8.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact",1771,"Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.78 billion represents a reported revenue decline of 6.8% and reflects a $44 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue declined 8.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health franchise, organic revenue declined [indiscernible] and includes a $106 million or a 370 basis point headwind from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our left atrial appendage closure franchise with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the United States, which is now substantially complete. 
The mid-quarter discontinuation of LOTUS Edge created a $50 million headwind in the quarter. As Mike detailed, these results are largely consistent with third quarter results as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased in December after our revenue was trending flat to 2019 through October and November. Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 includes a negative $0.06 impact from the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve as well as a negative $0.07 impact from the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge, primarily related to inventory charges. 
Our full year 2020 consolidated revenue of $9.913 billion declined 7.7% on a reported basis and 7.8% on an operational basis, which includes 350 basis points related to the acquisitions of Vertiflex and BTG and is net of the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise. Excluding this net contribution, organic sales declined 11.3%, including a 170 basis point headwind from the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. 
In addition to top line challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 include several charges: $0.10 related to the transition to WATCHMAN consignment, $0.07 related to LOTUS Edge inventory charges and $0.02 due to inventory charges related to the lower demand of the onset of the pandemic. This is partially offset by a net $0.05 tax benefit. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.9%, including a 440 basis point negative impact from LOTUS Edge inventory charges. Excluding these inventory charges, Q4 adjusted gross margin was equal to Q3 adjusted gross margin of 69.3% and in line with our expectations despite a larger impact from the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. 
Looking forward, we expect production in Q1 of 2021 to be at similar levels to Q4 2020, which means relatively more normal levels of manufacturing variances, although still negative, with volumes not yet back to historical levels. As a result, we expect to materially work through the lagging impact of unfavorable manufacturing variances capitalized on the balance sheet within the first half of 2021. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 18.3% or 25.6%, excluding a 300 basis point headwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment transition and a 450 basis point headwind related to the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was negative 0.3% and includes a $131 million goodwill impairment related to the announced sale of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, an additional $64 million in charges related to the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge and $18 million in litigation-related expenses. 
Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $108 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $429 million, in line with expectations at the beginning of the year. The cost of the make-whole call for early pay down of a portion of our May 22 bonds was more than offset by a gain on investments in the fourth quarter. A separate $363 million gain based on our investment in Pulmonx is included in our GAAP results and excluded from adjusted results. 
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 38.8% on a GAAP basis and 9.4% on an adjusted basis. Our full year tax rate was minus 1.7% on a GAAP basis and 5.2% on an adjusted basis, which is comprised of an operational rate of 11.2%, less 150 basis points of benefit from stock compensation and 450 basis points benefit from discrete items recognized during the year, the most significant of which was an $88 million noncash benefit driven by the Q3 completion of the IRS examination of our 2014 to 2016 tax years in a favorable position compared to our reserves. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, and free cash flow was $520 million, with $673 million from operating activities less $153 million net capital expenditures. Despite the pandemic, we generated very solid full year adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion, in line with 2019, and free cash flow of $1.1 billion with $1.5 billion from operating activities, less $364 million in net capital expenditures. 
For 2021, we aim to meet or exceed 2020 adjusted free cash flow with headwinds of increasing inventory and accounts receivable as we return to more normalized volumes. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $1.7 billion and total liquidity, including available credit facilities of $4.5 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&A. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities while continuing to remain active within our venture capital portfolio, and take advantage of opportunistic share repurchase as we did in December. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $535 million in shares and paid early $250 million of our May 2022 bonds. The total is roughly equivalent to the expected proceeds of the divestiture of [ Asbestos ] Pharmaceuticals, which is expected to close in the first half of 2021. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $18 million in Q4 to true-up our mesh reserve, including additional legal fees and some litigation outside the United States. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $569 million as of December 31, 2020. There's been no material change to the U.S. mesh claims outlook over the last 3 years. But during 2020, we incorporated estimable international claims, onetime claims made by a coalition of state attorneys general and adjustments to our legal fee reserve. Materially, all U.S. claims have been settled or in the final stages of settlement and we continue to work to fully resolve global mesh claims. However, given the nature of resolving the final claims and given COVID related delays in the courts, we expect full global resolution to lag into 2022. 
I'll now walk through guidance for full year 2021 and Q1 2021. As Mike stated, our guidance is based on assumptions that the impact of the COVID pandemic in Q1 2021 will drive similar results to Q4 2020, improve into Q2 2021 and that the second half of 2021 will return to relatively normal procedural volumes. With this high level trend, we're widening our top line guidance range to account for some degree of variability, while still trying to provide insight and direction. 
Likewise, our EPS guidance range will be wider to allow for flexibility in spending levels as the COVID-specific cost containment measures implemented in Q2 2020 were largely concluded as of year-end. We will continue to manage spending prudently, but we are making the necessary investments to ensure we are ready to capitalize on momentum in a post COVID world. 
Our guidance assumes the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals closes April 1, 2021, the midpoint of first half 2021 expectations, and does not include assumptions for acquisitions that have not yet closed, including Preventice Solutions. So for the full year, we expect 2021 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 12% to 18% versus 2020. This includes a tailwind of $179 million in WATCHMAN sales return reserves that were booked in 2020, a headwind of $62 million from 2020 LOTUS Edge sales and excludes a 300 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange as well as 190 basis points from the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. 
This guidance represents revenue growth of 0% and to 5% versus 2019, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and includes a $50 million headwind from 2019 LOTUS Edge sales. This calculation excludes 2019 sales of divested businesses, embolic beads, Intrauterine Health and Specialty Pharmaceuticals and excludes projected 2021 sales of acquired businesses, Vertiflex and BTG, prior to 24 months post close. Therefore, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise, as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $305 million in sales of Vertiflex through May and BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August as well as $35 million Specialty Pharmaceutical sales through March. 
For Q1 2021, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of minus 3% to plus 3% versus 2020, including a headwind of $21 million from Q1 2020 LOTUS Edge sales and excluding a 400 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, as well as 20 basis points from the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health franchise. This guidance represents down 6% to flat versus 2019, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. For this calculation, 2019 sales exclude $15 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $125 million in sales of Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines as well as $35 million Specialty Pharmaceutical sales. 
In terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 2021 to be below 2019, Q2 to improve and the second half of 2021 to be at or exceeding the full year 2019 level of 26.1%. We forecast our full year 2021 operational and adjusted tax rate to be approximately 11%, with minimal benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation as this benefit is primarily recognized within the first quarter. We expect adjusted below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect a fully weighted diluted -- fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.435 million shares for Q1 2021 and 1.436 billion shares for full year 2021. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.34, which includes approximately $0.01 from Specialty Pharmaceuticals and for the full year to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.58 adjusted earnings per share earned in 2019 and excludes Specialty Pharmaceuticals Q2 to Q4 of 2021. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2020 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q4 results. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

Then we think that's going to diminish quite a bit in the second quarter as vaccines roll out and patient demand increases, and we expect a very healthy second half of the year. 
So the normal guidance of 0% to 5% over '19 is clearly not what we do expect in a COVID-free environment. So it really reflects the impact of COVID in Q1 and some impact in Q2. It depends. Maybe Q2 will be better, depends on what happens to the vaccine rollout. But it lays out a COVID impact for really the first half of the year and getting back to at-market, if not above-market growth in second half, consistent with what we've done in the past, given the strength of the portfolio."

Bob, I'll take the Preventice one and then turn it over to Dr. Stein in a minute for the S-ICD commentary. So on Preventice, we're very excited about this acquisition. As you know, the business, and we'll talk about the reimbursement piece, too. The business grew $160 million in 2020. It grew over 30% growth. And as you know, there's also -- besides the broadest diagnostic portfolio that they offer with a short-term Holter long-term -- Holter MCOT event monitoring, we also add our implantable cardiac loop recorder. So we believe we have the most comprehensive diagnostic portfolio versus our peer group with that full suite of products. 
And importantly, if you look at Preventice, the long-term Holter segment is obviously very important. It represents call it, 10% to 15% of their sales. And it's a fast-growing market. And the reimbursement situation there, I would call that fluid. And so we expect to see additional meetings in the near future. And we'll see where that plays out in terms of that reimbursement. We don't think the current reimbursement level is consistent with the clinical results effectiveness and amount of work and labor required for long-term Holter. But I think that reimbursement position will be fluid. But I think what's unique to Preventice and Boston is the mix of the portfolio. 
So although the long-term Holter market was growing the fastest in May, in the future, depending on what happens with the reimbursement, we also have well over 80% of the product mix was growing over 20% in the other modalities, including MCOT and others. And the uniqueness of their device, they're able to switch from a long-term Holter or short-term Holter across these 4 modalities, given the software they have. So I think the mix of the products is helpful. The reimbursement in the other 3 categories is actually slightly improved. And so I think we have the nice flexibility to move patients seamlessly across that continuum of diagnostics. The reimbursements improved in some areas. There is obviously a headwind with long-term Holter, and I think there will be quite a few discussions on that aspect in the future. 
So I think given the mix of products and the benefit for BSC, we're quite happy with that acquisition and comfortable that it will grow very healthy. In terms of S-ICD, Dr. Stein, I'll turn that over to you in terms of that question."

And I think what you're referring to is the FDA classification of our recent advisory regarding the electrode, that's a critical part of the S-ICD system. And I think it's really important just to emphasize to everyone who's listening. In this particular case, we did not issue the advisory because of the rate of the issue that we were seeing. The rate is actually only 0.2% at 41 months. And that rate is at least as good, if not actually better than the best transvenous leads that are out there on the market, right? 
So in this case, we advised -- because with the advisory, we were able to give physicians better education on how to detect and how to diagnose the issue as they follow their patients post implant. The FDA classification then was expected. The FDA's determination is not based on rates of harm. I'd tell you, overall, the impact that we see has been limited. The EP community as a whole recognizes the excellent overall performance of the S-ICD electrode and the unique benefits that this device offers. It is still the only ICD on the market that can provide defibrillation without touching the heart and vascular system. 
And those considerations, frankly, are why the FDA and international regulators have uniformly agreed that the electrode should remain on the market and ought to remain available for physicians and for patients."

But to the extent that reimbursement rates can't get revised, do you have relief? And are you as committed to this transaction when the biggest growth driver, obviously, is a little impaired? That's number one. The other one is just on WATCHMAN. Is these consignment comments that you made in the fourth quarter, if consignment was larger than expected.

I'll start with the WATCHMAN one. That consignment really exceeded our expectations. We're complete with it. You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any LOTUS charges. So that's good. And really, what it just shows that the broad ado",390,"Yes. I'll start with the WATCHMAN one. That consignment really exceeded our expectations. We're complete with it. You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any LOTUS charges. So that's good. And really, what it just shows that the broad adoption and enthusiasm for WATCHMAN FLX. So we'll be easily done with the full WATCHMAN conversion in the second quarter. It's well on its way now. And so most of our customers want to switch to FLX, given the safety profile and the ease of use and the momentum that it has. So that really exceeded it. We expect to have a great year with WATCHMAN in 2021 and beyond. The option trial, we'll finish enrolling by year-end. The CHAMPION trial is enrolling now. 
There's a portfolio of enhancements behind WATCHMAN FLX. And there's a lot of momentum with that business. So that's really good. On Preventice, we're excited about it. And as I mentioned before, as you said, the long-term Holter is the faster-growing market. And Preventice has done a nice job in taking share in that market. And there is some exposure, as you said, about 15% of that product mix is long-term Holter. But only about half of that is impacted by the current reimbursement modification given the Medicare mix there. 
So call that $10-ish million of exposure within that 1 segment. As I mentioned before, the other segments had a modification of slight tailwind of improvement in reimbursement. And again, Preventice is the only company that can offer that variability. And so if the market shifts a bit more towards MCOT in the near term, that's a win for Preventice. They're the market-leading portfolio there and the businesses outside of long-term Holter grew nearly 20% in 2020. So the other businesses, although the market growth of those segments aren't as strong as long-term Holter, Preventice gained share against its competitive set in 2020. And we have the ability to move across that portfolio. 
So obviously, the long-term Holter market is a strategic segment. It's the faster-growing segment where we've gained share. And we'll work with the societies and industry as well as the appropriate authorities to educate as best we can on the clinical efficacy and the costs associated. And maybe Dr. Stein, do you want to comment more on that piece of it?"

Again, I think we're sort of disappointed a bit just in the failure recognized the advantages that you get with a long-term versus a short-term Holter. I mean the math on this isn't really hard.

Again, I think we're sort of disappointed a bit just in the failure recognized the advantages that you get with a long-term versus a short-term Holter. I mean the math on this isn't really hard. If you do a 14-day Holter mode, you get 7x as much data as you get when you do a 2-day Holter recording. And particularly, if you're doing the study, looking for intermittent conditions like atrial fibrillation, it's probably the most common reason to order one of these tests. Diagnostic yield is far greater with the longer-term recording. And I think, over the long run, I don't think that's a heavy lift to convince payers of that proposition. 
In the short term, again, it just gets back to what Mike said. Preventice really has some unique competitive differentiation, particularly in the fact that their body Guardian Mini product can do all 4 of the modes of monitoring, short-term Holter, long-term Holter, event monitoring and MCOT, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry. And so the ability to do that switch remotely is a big advantage in light of these kinds of payer decisions and also just put that on top of they're really, I think, industry-leading AI abilities, which are useful within the ambulatory monitoring space and also just really brings an enhanced capability to Boston Scientific as a company."

I think probably the best way to go through that, Larry, is maybe just to give you a quick walk through the components of operating margin, which is really the driver there.

I think probably the best way to go through that, Larry, is maybe just to give you a quick walk through the components of operating margin, which is really the driver there. So in terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 will be dilutive to 2019. Q2 improves and then I think the key point is that in what is -- could largely be characterized as a post COVID world when we get to the second half of '21, that will be at or exceeding the full year operating margin of 26.1% in the second half. So why is that? And again, that corresponds to that period where you have more normalized volumes. 
And the key really is gross margin in the short term. It's interesting, if you go back and you take a look at 2020 and you adjust out LOTUS and WATCHMAN. And then the abnormal variances we talked a lot about in Q2 from the lower production volumes, you kind of get a gross margin that's around 70% each of those quarters. So I think we've proven that in a COVID impacted world, gross margin is in that approaching 70% range. And so that's probably where it is in the first quarter as well, is in that approaching 70 range because we're still in a COVID world. We have lower volumes. We actually have more COVID related costs. Things in the manufacturing plants, we have to do related to COVID, including higher freight and other things that in the time that we're impacted by COVID, we're likely in that world. 
Now the good news is, in 2020, and you saw it from the cash flow, we were able to deliver very strong cash flow, and a lot of that was working capital, but also reducing our operating expenses. So we took strong measures in 2020 to do that. Well, as those kind of lapse at the end of 2020, we haven't put a lot of those back in place because we want to invest. We want to be going towards the point we're in that post COVID world investing for momentum. We're spending smartly. We're obviously making the right investments, mostly commercially and research and development focused. But you're likely to potentially see a little bit of an uptick in spend as a percentage of sales in the first half of '21. 
However, as we've talked about over the last 6 months, there's less in travel and there's less in other areas. So long story short, when you look at the profile of the elements of operating margin, gross margin is likely challenged in the first quarter or second quarter, it will start to improve in the back half, as it always does anyway historically, sequentially, as you go through the year. So we think that's a likelihood. And then from an OpEx perspective, as you get higher sales, you'll have the SG&A percentage to be lower as a percentage of that, which then gets us above that 26.1% in the second half. 
So gross margin, a little bit less contribution than we might have thought a year ago, and SG&A probably lower than we thought a year ago. But again, key back to operating margin expansion in the second half versus 2019."

So I'd say the business responds very quickly once the vaccine -- once the COVID impact stabilizes and decreases and as vaccines will become more prominent, you'll see a sharp recovery of these businesses. 
Many of our businesses, as you saw, fourth quarter grew. PI grew 5%. The BTG interventional grew double digit. Paclitaxel grew plus 20%, Endo and Uro grew. So some of our businesses are just more impacted, namely Spinal Cord Stimulation, Urology and some of our core CRM IC businesses. And as COVID improves, we've seen that it steps back pretty quickly.

And there's near-term here, the challenge continues to be access, having our teams accessible to the suites to really drive what is a kind of a behavior change in using a single-use scope. And so as COVID continues to improve, this will be a great growth driver for us in 2021 and we'll get better and better each quarter, just like we're seeing now. 
However, the ability for us to really turn on accounts and higher utilization is difficult given the limitations of some of the rep access and the hesitancy to modify kind of current practices in the COVID world. But we have seen some success, for sure, and our team, the reimbursement is very helpful. And as the year goes on, that will become a more meaningful growth driver each quarter for us. And we'll launch the bronchoscope in the second half of 2021 and we believe this will be a nice $2 billion market for us. And it's -- we think it will follow a very similar path ex COVID as our urology scope did as well as our Spyglass Scope and Endo as well.

So we have no shortage of product launches that we're launching right now that will impact '22 as well. In terms of the clinical trial, I would say it's a bit mixed. The WATCHMAN clinical trials have ramped very quickly with the OPTION trial, the CHAMPION trial starting. Some of the trials that require new therapies have been a bit slower. We are excited about the mitral approval in the -- to begin that clinical trial in the U.S., which is a nice win for us. We had some challenges trying to do that overseas given the COVID impact. The EXALT-D, we already talked about. 
So I would say it's a bit of a kind of a mixed result depending on which business you're in. But in some of the markets maybe about a 6-month impact in terms of enrollment timing. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for ACURATE, we're rolling the U.S. trial for cryo. So maybe there's some impact, maybe the 6-month range for, I would think, most companies in terms of clinical trial work. I don't know, Dr. Stein or Dr. Meredith, any thoughts on that?"

We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials &  Filings.  
The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q4 performance, inclusive of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q1 and fiscal year 2021 guidance.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including Vertiflex through June and BTG through August 15, as there are no prior period related net sales as well as the divestitures of the global embolic microspheres portfolio and the intrauterine health franchise.
Guidance excludes the recently announced Preventice acquisition and assumes an April 1 divestiture of the BTG Specialty Pharmaceutical business. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Average daily sales normalizes sales growth for a difference in selling days year-over-year. Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8%, excluding COVID, represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.

Thanks for joining us today. As we finish up the challenging 2020, I'm very proud of how the BSC team has responded and how we're able to serve patients while keeping our employees safe and leveraging this year's challenges into a strengthening of our portfolio and digital capabilities. We're excited about the outlook in 2021 and beyond and expect to return to growth, supported by our category leadership positions, innovative pipeline and ongoing expansion into higher-growth markets.  
We are well positioned to emerge in the headwinds of the pandemic in a strengthened position given our innovative and diversified portfolio and our global team. As we preannounced on January 12, Q4 2020 sales declined 8% on an organic basis, which included 370 basis points of negative impact from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the U.S.  
Organic sales, excluding the impact of this WATCHMAN consignment, grew low single digits in October, down low single digits in November and then declined low double digits in December as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified in Europe and the U.S. in particular.  
Our fourth quarter sales results were largely consistent with our third quarter '20 results, which declined 6% organically which included a 230 basis point impact from WATCHMAN consignment. For the full year 2020, operational sales declined 7.8%, and organic sales declined 11.3%, both of which include the 170 basis point impact from WATCHMAN.  
Today, we also announced Q4 adjusted operating margin of 18.3% and adjusted EPS of $0.23, which includes approximately 730 basis points and $0.13 of charges, respectively, related to WATCHMAN consignment and LOTUS Edge discontinuation. Importantly, we do not expect any material charges related to WATCHMAN consignment or LOTUS in 2021. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was 19.3%, with adjusted EPS of $0.96, reflecting the impact of reduced procedure volume due to COVID as well as the impact from the shift to WATCHMAN consignment and LOTUS.  
Full year 2020 cash flow was strong despite the COVID impact at $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow with free cash flow at $1.1 billion. Our 2020 financials are clearly a negative outlier to our pre-pandemic 6-year track record of excellent results. We believe we will return to delivering strong results in 2021, thanks to our strategy of category leadership in key markets, portfolio diversification into high-growth adjacencies.  
We continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives and drive towards ex COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic sales growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, with improved ability to deploy our healthy free cash flow. We're excited to turn the page in 2020 and confident in our plans to build on our global momentum in '21 and beyond. We are reinstating guidance for Q1 and 2021 full year, which is based on our underlying COVID impact assumptions.  
These assumptions reflect an ongoing meaningful impact from the pandemic in first quarter, improvement in second quarter and a return to more normal procedure levels in second half '21. Our guidance also excludes the recently announced Preventice acquisition and assumes an April 1 divestiture of the BTG Spec Pharma business.  
We're targeting 2021 organic revenue growth of 12% to 18% versus 2020 and flat to up 5% versus 2019, both excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and Dan will give more details. Given the expected waning impact of COVID-19, we expect to see organic revenue accelerate over the course of the year, and we're guiding to full year adjusted EPS of $1.50 to $1.60. For Q1 '21, sales trends in January continued to be challenging due to the impact of COVID. However, we anticipate that our sales trends will improve throughout Q1 as COVID trends stabilize and vaccine access improves.  
As a result, we forecast first quarter '21 organic revenue in a range of down 3% to up 3% versus 2020 and down 6% to flat versus 2019, both excluding the impact of acquisitions, with adjusted EPS of $0.28 to $0.34.  
I'll now provide some brief highlights of Q4 and 2020 results along with thoughts on our '21 outlook. So returning back to Q4, regionally, the U.S. is down 9% on an operational basis, inclusive of the 600 basis point WATCHMAN impact. Both Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pac were also down 6% operationally. Operationally, emerging sales -- emerging market sales declined 9%, and China was down 7%. China results include a 10% -- point negative impact from the DES tender sales return reserves.  
Outside this impact, China had excellent sales in IC imaging, complex coronary, PI, structural heart, urology, pelvic health, and we expect double-digit growth from China in 2021 given the momentum in these franchises, the diversification of our portfolio and with drug-eluting stents now representing approximately 5% of our China revenue mix in 2021.  
I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology and Pelvic Health sales grew 1% on an organic basis in the quarter, normalizing for the intrauterine health divestiture. Full year sales declined 7%, and Q4 growth was led by continued strength in LithoVue, SpaceOAR and Rezum. In Q4, LithoVue grew double digits and crossed the threshold of treating 200,000 patients cumulatively. We recently launched SpaceOAR Vue Hydrogel, which is visible under CT imaging and helped drive full year growth for that franchise north of 20% versus 2019.  
And for Endoscopy, Q4 sales also grew 1% with a broad-based recovery across regions and notable strength in infection prevention. Full year 2020 sales declined 6%. Our EXALT-D launch is receiving a strong physician feedback, and we continue to expand our global account base. Unfortunately, hospital systems during COVID-19 restrictions have made adoption of EXALT-D more challenging. We do expect EXALT-D to build momentum throughout 2021 and remain bullish on the significant multiyear runway, but the pandemic continues to be a short-term headwind in driving EXALT-D access.  
We will also continue to build a body of clinical evidence and are very encouraged by uptake of the transitional pass-through payment for EXALT-D in the outpatient setting. The launch of SpyGlass Discover continues to go well, and we continue to target launch of our single-use bronchoscope in the second half of 2021. We're also pleased to have recently launched the ORISE ProKnife, which complements our high-growth endoluminal surgery portfolio.  
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, Q4 sales declined 6% with both high- and low-voltage performance similar to overall CRM. Full year sales declined 12%. In 2021, we anticipate beginning enrollment soon in modular ATP, our dual-track clinical study for a stand-alone leadless pacemaker as well as provide antitachycardia pacing to EMBLEM S-ICD patients. Our high-voltage business is now nearly 3x the size of our low-voltage business, so increasing access to EMBLEM S-ICD for appropriate patient populations is a significant driver for this leadless pacemaker work.  
Importantly, our LUX-Dx implantable cardiac monitor is off to an excellent launch given this high-quality ECG signals, arrhythmia algorithm performance and streamlined back-end monitoring. We're also excited about our recent acquisition of Preventice Solutions, which grew 30% in 2020 to $158 million by offering best-in-class detection algorithms, a broad portfolio with Bodyguardian Mini that covers all 4 modalities of ambulatory ECG monitoring and establishes a strong position for BSC in the field of cardiac diagnostics. We expect to close the deal by mid '21, after which we'll be uniquely positioned across all diagnostic therapies, including AECG and LUX-Dx, our implantable cardiac monitor, and HeartLogic as well as implantable and ablative therapies.  
Electrophysiology sales were down 2% in Q4 and 14% for the full year. In December, we did begin the full launch of POLARx, the second-generation single-shot cryoablation catheter in Europe, and physicians are noting POLARx ease of use and attractive procedure duration. StablePoint, our novel forceps in therapeutic catheter with DIRECTSENSE, was also recently approved in Japan and is receiving positive EU physician feedback early in the commercial launch.  
In Neuromodulation, Q4 organic revenue declined 12%, but grew sequentially from Q3, while full year neuromod sales were down 16%. The fourth quarter decline was primarily due to a high rate of spinal cord stimulation patient cancellations in November and December due to the COVID surge. We expect the majority of these procedures to be rescheduled and are pleased to have launched our next-generation WaveWriter Alpha SCS system at NANS last month.  
Alpha offers FAST and Contour paresthesia-free waveforms with MRI capability supported by our Cognita software solutions that enhance the physician's ability to identify, manage and maintain SCS patients. We also recently received U.S. approval of our Vercise Genus platform, which expands our MRI capabilities in both the rechargeable and nonrechargeable segments, with Bluetooth communication between the implant, the patient remote and the physician programmer.  
Turning to Interventional Cardiology. Q4 sales declined 23% organically, but that includes an approximate negative 1,600 basis point impact related to the transition to WATCHMAN consignment and for the China tender reserve. Full year IC sales were down 18%, including a 720 basis point impact related to the same reserve items. The WATCHMAN franchise accelerated its recovery in Q4, with 18% growth excluding the impact of the WATCHMAN consignment. Our U.S. launch of WATCHMAN FLX has gone extremely well, with positive physician feedback and device performance and safety in a higher-than-expected conversion rate in the shift to consignment model.  
This program to shift has now concluded, and we target a complete conversion to FLX by mid-2021. We're also continuing to invest in clinical trials to expand the patient indication for WATCHMAN FLX. We expect to complete enrollment of the OPTION trial by year-end.  
Within coronary therapies, we continue to improve our sales mix each year via the growth and innovation of our complex PCI franchise. Although drug-eluting stents continue to be a challenge from a pricing standpoint, DES now represents 7% of total company sales in 2020. And we continue to differentiate with new product launches, such as SYNERGY XD and 48-millimeter as well as the newly approved MEGATRON in the U.S.  
Our complex PCI portfolio is an important growth driver with new products such as COMET and AVVIGO and next-gen ROTAPRO. We expect our global PCI and imaging franchise to be 50% larger than DES in 2021. In TAVR, ACURATE neo2 is performing very well in Europe, given its excellent ease of use, low rates of PVL and best-in-class pacemaker rates and hemodynamics. We continue to focus on the neo2 U.S. IDE enrollment. And in mitral later this year, we'll begin an early feasibility study in the U.S. for Millipede, a transcatheter angioplasty ring system for patients with functional mitral regurgitation.  
In Peripheral Interventions, Q4 organic sales grew 5%, which was an acceleration from Q3 and reflect an overall mix of high acuity as well as category-leading portfolio and a broad cadence of new product launches. Full year PI sales declined 3%, and the BTG Interventional Medicine business grew 12% in the quarter, led by high-teens growth in EKOS and a new console, new reimbursement and market penetration into pulmonary embolism. We continue to have best-in-class clinical evidence of our EKOS system will add to our breadth and research with anticipation of HI-PEITHO trial, the first global head-to-head study of interventional therapy for pulmonary embolism compared to standard anticoagulation.  
In arterial, our drug-eluting portfolio grew mid-20s as we launched the Ranger DCB in the U.S. and saw uptake of the NTAP for Eluvia. And the market continues to cover as additional long-term data sets continue to show no mortality risk associated with paclitaxel devices. Now we expect our drug-eluting portfolio to exceed [ $115 million ] in 2021.  
I'd also like to highlight briefly 2 important sustainability accomplishments this quarter: inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index; and the Newsweek's America's Most Responsible Companies 2021 list. These recognitions are a gratifying reflection of our commitment to sustainable, economic, environmental and social practices. So overall, we're very optimistic on the outlook for 2021 and beyond. The high acuity nature of our portfolio, multiple product launches and a diminishing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic should all help BSC to execute well and significantly improve performance in '21.  
We will continue to execute our category leadership strategy and diversify the portfolio into high-growth markets like the Preventice acquisition, which is expected to add exciting growth diagnostics platform with excellent long-term prospects. This deal is the latest example of our strength in balance sheet and compelling venture portfolio, which enable to continue to develop multiple high-growth market opportunities. In addition, the excellent work of our health care economics and reg teams in 2020 led to multiple product approvals and reimbursement wins. That also positions us well to go forward.  
We continue to drive towards ex COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic revenue growth and margin expansion to drive strong cash flow and double-digit adjusted EPS. And finally, we continue to live our values with enduring commitment to sustainable business practices. I'm grateful to our employees and for their winning spirit, and now I'll turn things over to Dan."

Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.708 billion represents a reported revenue decline of 6.8% and reflects a $44 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue declined 8.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise, organic revenue declined 8% and includes a $106 million or a 370 basis point headwind from the sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for our left atrial appendage closure franchise with the launch of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in the United States, which is now substantially complete. 
The mid-quarter discontinuation of LOTUS Edge created a [ $15 million ] headwind in the quarter. As Mike detailed, these results are largely consistent with third quarter results as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased in December after our revenue was trending flat to 2019 through October and November. Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 includes a negative $0.06 impact from the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve as well as a negative $0.07 impact from the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge, primarily related to inventory charges. 
Our full year 2020 consolidated revenue of $9.913 billion declined 7.7% on a reported basis and 7.8% on an operational basis, which includes 350 basis points related to the acquisitions of Vertiflex and BTG and is net of the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise. Excluding this net contribution, organic sales declined 11.3%, including a 170 basis point headwind from the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. 
In addition to top line challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 include several charges: $0.10 related to the transition to WATCHMAN consignment, $0.07 related to LOTUS Edge inventory charges and $0.02 due to inventory charges related to the lower demand at the onset of the pandemic. This is partially offset by a net $0.05 tax benefit. 
Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.9%, including a 440 basis point negative impact from LOTUS Edge inventory charges. Excluding these inventory charges, Q4 adjusted gross margin was equal to Q3 adjusted gross margin of 69.3% and in line with our expectations despite a larger impact from the transition to WATCHMAN consignment. 
Looking forward, we expect production in Q1 of 2021 to be at similar levels to Q4 2020, which means relatively more normal levels of manufacturing variances, although still negative, with volumes not yet back to historical levels. As a result, we expect to materially work through the lagging impact of unfavorable manufacturing variances capitalized on the balance sheet within the first half of 2021. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 18.3% or 25.6%, excluding a 300 basis point headwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment transition and a 450 basis point headwind related to the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was negative 0.3% and includes a $131 million goodwill impairment related to the announced sale of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, an additional $64 million in charges related to the discontinuation of LOTUS Edge and $18 million in litigation-related expenses. 
Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $108 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $429 million, in line with expectations at the beginning of the year. The cost of the make-whole call for early paydown of a portion of our May 22 bonds was more than offset by a gain on investments in the fourth quarter. A separate $363 million gain based on our investment in Pulmonx is included in our GAAP results and excluded from adjusted results. 
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 38.8% on a GAAP basis and 9.4% on an adjusted basis. Our full year tax rate was minus 1.7% on a GAAP basis and 5.2% on an adjusted basis, which is comprised of an operational rate of 11.2%, less 150 basis points of benefit from stock compensation and 450 basis points benefit from discrete items recognized during the year, the most significant of which was an $88 million noncash benefit driven by the Q3 completion of the IRS examination of our 2014 to 2016 tax years in a favorable position compared to our reserves. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, and free cash flow was $520 million, with $673 million from operating activities, less $153 million net capital expenditures. Despite the pandemic, we generated very solid full year adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion, in line with 2019, and free cash flow of $1.1 billion with $1.5 billion from operating activities, less $364 million in net capital expenditures. 
For 2021, we aim to meet or exceed 2020 adjusted free cash flow with headwinds of increasing inventory and accounts receivable as we return to more normalized volumes. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $1.7 billion and total liquidity, including available credit facilities of $4.5 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&A. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities while continuing to remain active within our venture capital portfolio and take advantage of opportunistic share repurchase as we did in December. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $535 million in shares and paid early $250 million of our May 2022 bonds. The total is roughly equivalent to the expected proceeds of the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which is expected to close in the first half of 2021. With respect to our legal reserves, we booked $18 million in Q4 to true-up our mesh reserve, including additional legal fees and some litigation outside the United States. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $569 million as of December 31, 2020. There's been no material change to the U.S. mesh claims outlook over the last 3 years. But during 2020, we incorporated estimable international claims, onetime claims made by a coalition of state attorneys general and adjustments to our legal fee reserve. Materially, all U.S. claims have been settled or in the final stages of settlement and we continue to work to fully resolve global mesh claims. However, given the nature of resolving the final claims and given COVID related delays in the courts, we expect full global resolution to lag into 2022. 
I'll now walk through guidance for full year 2021 and Q1 2021. As Mike stated, our guidance is based on assumptions that the impact of the COVID pandemic in Q1 2021 will drive similar results to Q4 2020, improve into Q2 2021 and that the second half of 2021 will return to relatively normal procedural volumes. With this high-level trend, we're widening our top line guidance range to account for some degree of variability, while still trying to provide insight and direction. 
Likewise, our EPS guidance range will be wider to allow for flexibility in spending levels as the COVID-specific cost containment measures implemented in Q2 2020 were largely concluded as of year-end. We will continue to manage spending prudently, but we are making the necessary investments to ensure we are ready to capitalize on momentum in a post-COVID world. 
Our guidance assumes the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals closes April 1, 2021, the midpoint of first half 2021 expectations, and does not include assumptions for acquisitions that have not yet closed, including Preventice Solutions. So for the full year, we expect 2021 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 12% to 18% versus 2020. This includes a tailwind of $179 million in WATCHMAN sales return reserves that were booked in 2020, a headwind of $62 million from 2020 LOTUS Edge sales and excludes a 300 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange as well as 190 basis points from the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. 
This guidance represents revenue growth of 0% to 5% versus 2019, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and includes a $50 million headwind from 2019 LOTUS Edge sales. This calculation excludes 2019 sales of divested businesses, embolic beads, intrauterine health and Specialty Pharmaceuticals and excludes projected 2021 sales of acquired businesses, Vertiflex and BTG, prior to 24 months post close. Therefore, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $305 million in sales of Vertiflex through May and BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August as well as $35 million Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales through March. 
For Q1 2021, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of minus 3% to plus 3% versus 2020, including a headwind of $21 million from Q1 2020 LOTUS Edge sales and excluding a 400 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange as well as 20 basis points from the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise. This guidance represents down 6% to flat versus 2019, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. For this calculation, 2019 sales exclude $15 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $125 million in sales of Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines as well as $35 million Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales. 
In terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 2021 to be below 2019, Q2 to improve and the second half of 2021 to be at or exceeding the full year 2019 level of 26.1%. We forecast our full year 2021 operational and adjusted tax rate to be approximately 11%, with minimal benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation as this benefit is primarily recognized within the first quarter. We expect adjusted below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect a fully weighted diluted -- fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.435 billion shares for Q1 2021 and 1.436 billion shares for full year 2021. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.34, which includes approximately $0.01 from Specialty Pharmaceuticals and for the full year to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.58 adjusted earnings per share earned in 2019 and excludes Specialty Pharmaceuticals' Q2 to Q4 of 2021. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2020 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q4 results. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

And I think excluding -- we've had obviously challenged in 2020 with COVID. So we see as COVID wanes and COVID eventually towards second -- as we go to the second half of the year, as the impact diminishes, as vaccines roll out and the business becomes more normal, we will then grow faster than our peer group just like we used to. So during the period where we're impacted, we're impacted 20 months of COVID impact in 2020, and we're seeing some impact in first quarter. And we think that's good, diminish quite a bit in the second quarter as vaccines roll out and patient demand increases, and we expect a very healthy second half of the year. 
So the normal guidance of 0% to 5% over '19 is clearly not what we do expect in a COVID-free environment. So it really reflects the impact of COVID in Q1 and some impact in Q2. It depends. Maybe Q2 will be better, depends on what happens to the vaccine rollout. But it lays out a COVID impact for really the first half of the year and getting back to at-market, if not above-market growth in second half, consistent with what we've done in the past, given the strength of the portfolio."

Bob, I'll take the Preventice one and then turn it over to Dr. Stein in a minute for the S-ICD commentary. So on Preventice, we're very excited about this acquisition. As you know, the business, and we'll talk about the reimbursement piece, too. The business grew $160 million in 2020. It grew over 30% growth. And as you know, there's also -- besides the broadest diagnostic portfolio that they offer with a short-term Holter long-term -- Holter MCOT event monitoring, we also add our implantable cardiac loop recorder. So we believe we have the most comprehensive diagnostic portfolio versus our peer group with that full suite of products. 
And importantly, if you look at Preventice, the long-term Holter segment is obviously very important. It represents call it, 10% to 15% of their sales. And it's a fast-growing market. And the reimbursement situation there, I would call that fluid. And so we expect to see additional meetings in the near future. And we'll see where that plays out in terms of that reimbursement. We don't think the current reimbursement level is consistent with the clinical results effectiveness and amount of work and labor required for long-term Holter. But I think that reimbursement position will be fluid. But I think what's unique to Preventice and Boston is the mix of the portfolio. 
So although the long-term Holter market was growing the fastest in May, in the future, depending on what happens with the reimbursement, we also have well over 80% of the product mix was growing over 20% in the other modalities, including MCOT and others. And the uniqueness of their device, they're able to switch from a long-term Holter, short-term Holter across these 4 modalities, given the software they have. So I think the mix of the products is helpful. The reimbursement in the other 3 categories is actually slightly improved. And so I think we have the nice flexibility to move patients seamlessly across that continuum of diagnostics. The reimbursements improved in some areas. There is obviously a headwind with long-term Holter, and I think there will be quite a few discussions on that aspect in the future. 
So I think given the mix of products and the benefit for BSC, we're quite happy with that acquisition and comfortable that it will grow very healthy. In terms of S-ICD, Dr. Stein, I'll turn that over to you in terms of that question."

And I think what you're referring to is the FDA classification of our recent advisory regarding the electrode, that's a critical part of the S-ICD system. And I think it's really important just to emphasize to everyone who's listening. In this particular case, we did not issue the advisory because of the rate of the issue that we were seeing. The rate is actually only 0.2% at 41 months. And that rate is at least as good, if not actually better than the best transvenous leads that are out there on the market, right? 
So in this case, we advised -- because with the advisory, we were able to give physicians better education on how to detect and how to diagnose the issue as they follow their patients post implant. The FDA classification then was expected. The FDA's determination is not based on rates of harm. I'd tell you, overall, the impact that we see has been limited. The EP community as a whole recognizes the excellent overall performance of the S-ICD electrode and the unique benefits that this device offers. It is still the only ICD on the market that can provide defibrillation without touching the heart and vascular system. 
And those considerations, frankly, are why the FDA and international regulators have uniformly agreed that the electrode should remain on the market and ought to remain available for physicians and for patients."

But to the extent that reimbursement rates can't get revised, do you have relief? And are you as committed to this transaction when the biggest growth driver, obviously, is a little impaired? That's number one. The other one is just on WATCHMAN. Is these consignment comments that you made in the fourth quarter, if consignment was larger than expected, what does that tell us in terms of your commercial progress in terms of converting accounts over to FLX? Are you feeling a lot better about that FLX conversion getting there by midyear based on what we saw on consignment?"

I'll start with the WATCHMAN one. That consignment really exceeded our expectations. We're complete with it. You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any LOTUS charges. So that's good. And really, what it just shows that the broad ado",391,"Yes. I'll start with the WATCHMAN one. That consignment really exceeded our expectations. We're complete with it. You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any LOTUS charges. So that's good. And really, what it just shows that the broad adoption and enthusiasm for WATCHMAN FLX. So we'll be easily done with the full WATCHMAN conversion in the second quarter. It's well on its way now. And so most of our customers want to switch to FLX, given the safety profile and the ease of use and the momentum that it has. So that really exceeded it. We expect to have a great year with WATCHMAN in 2021 and beyond. The OPTION trial, we'll finish enrolling by year-end. The CHAMPION trial is enrolling now. 
There's a portfolio of enhancements behind WATCHMAN FLX, and there's a lot of momentum with that business. So that's really good. On Preventice, we're excited about it. And as I mentioned before, as you said, the long-term Holter is the faster-growing market. And Preventice has done a nice job in taking share in that market. And there is some exposure, as you said, about 15% of that product mix is long-term Holter. But only about half of that is impacted by the current reimbursement modification given the Medicare mix there. 
So call that $10-ish million of exposure within that 1 segment. As I mentioned before, the other segments had a modification of slight tailwind of improvement in reimbursement. And again, Preventice is the only company that can offer that variability. And so if the market shifts a bit more towards MCOT in the near term, that's a win for Preventice. They have a market-leading portfolio there and the businesses outside of long-term Holter grew nearly 20% in 2020. So the other businesses, although the market growth of those segments aren't as strong as long-term Holter, Preventice gained share against its competitive set in 2020. And we have the ability to move across that portfolio. 
So obviously, the long-term Holter market is a strategic segment. It's the faster-growing segment where we've gained share. And we'll work with the societies and industry as well as the appropriate authorities to educate as best we can on the clinical efficacy and the costs associated. And maybe Dr. Stein, do you want to comment more on that piece of it?"

Again, I think we're sort of disappointed a bit just in the failure to recognize the advantages that you get with a long-term versus a short-term Holter. I mean the math on this isn't really hard.

Again, I think we're sort of disappointed a bit just in the failure to recognize the advantages that you get with a long-term versus a short-term Holter. I mean the math on this isn't really hard. If you do a 14-day Holter monitor, you get 7x as much data as you get when you do a 2-day Holter recording. And particularly, if you're doing the study, looking for intermittent conditions like atrial fibrillation, it's probably the most common reason to order one of these tests, the diagnostic yield is far greater with the longer-term recording. And I think, over the long run, I don't think that's a heavy lift to convince payers of that proposition. 
In the short term, again, it just gets back to what Mike said. Preventice really has some unique competitive differentiation, particularly in the fact that their BodyGuardian Mini product can do all 4 of the modes of monitoring, short-term Holter, long-term Holter, event monitoring and MCOT, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry. And so the ability to do that switch remotely is a big advantage in light of these kinds of payer decisions and also just put that on top of they're really, I think, industry-leading AI abilities, which are useful within the ambulatory monitoring space and also just really brings an enhanced capability to Boston Scientific as a company."

I think probably the best way to go through that, Larry, is maybe just to give you a quick walk through the components of operating margin, which is really the driver there. So in terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 will be dilutive to",544,"Sure. I think probably the best way to go through that, Larry, is maybe just to give you a quick walk through the components of operating margin, which is really the driver there. So in terms of adjusted operating margin, we expect Q1 will be dilutive to 2019. Q2 improves and then I think the key point is that in what is -- could largely be characterized as a post-COVID world when we get to the second half of '21, that will be at or exceeding the full year operating margin of 26.1% in the second half. So why is that? And again, that corresponds to that period where you have more normalized volumes. 
And the key really is gross margin in the short term. It's interesting, if you go back and you take a look at 2020 and you adjust out LOTUS and WATCHMAN. And then the abnormal variances we talked a lot about in Q2 from the lower production volumes, you kind of get a gross margin that's around 70% each of those quarters. So I think we've proven that in a COVID-impacted world, gross margin is in that, approaching 70% range. And so that's probably where it is in the first quarter as well, is in that approaching 70 range because we're still in a COVID world. We have lower volumes. We actually have more COVID-related costs. Things in the manufacturing plants, we have to do related to COVID, including higher freight and other things that in the time that we're impacted by COVID, we're likely in that world. 
Now the good news is, in 2020, and you saw it from the cash flow, we were able to deliver very strong cash flow, and a lot of that was working capital, but also reducing our operating expenses. So we took strong measures in 2020 to do that. Well, as those kind of lapse at the end of 2020, we haven't put a lot of those back in place because we want to invest. We want to be going towards the point we're in that post-COVID world investing for momentum. We're spending smartly. We're obviously making the right investments, mostly commercially and research and development focused. But you're likely to potentially see a little bit of an uptick in spend as a percentage of sales in the first half of '21. 
However, as we've talked about over the last 6 months, there's less in travel and there's less in other areas. So long story short, when you look at the profile of the elements of operating margin, gross margin is likely challenged in the first quarter or second quarter. It will start to improve in the back half, as it always does anyway historically, sequentially, as you go through the year. So we think that's a likelihood. And then from an OpEx perspective, as you get higher sales, you'll have the SG&A percentage to be lower as a percentage of that, which then gets us above that 26.1% in the second half. 
So gross margin, a little bit less contribution than we might have thought a year ago, and SG&A probably lower than we thought a year ago. But again, key back to operating margin expansion in the second half versus 2019."

You saw in the second quarter, the impact of some of our businesses like spinal cord stimulators and Uro/PH fell, I think, neuromod was down 40% in the second quarter and Uro was down 30%. And you saw them snap back very quickly when the COVID impact improved in the third quarter. And then obviously, COVID came back stronger again. So I'd say the business responds very quickly once the vaccine -- once the COVID impact stabilizes and decreases and as vaccines will become more prominent, you'll see a sharp recovery of these businesses. 
Many of our businesses, as you saw, fourth quarter grew. PI grew 5%. The BTG interventional grew double digit. Paclitaxel grew plus 20%, Endo and Uro grew. So some of our businesses are just more impacted, namely Spinal Cord Stimulation, urology and some of our core CRM IC businesses. And as COVID improves, we've seen that it steps back pretty quickly. And that's where you see a very bullish second half guide when we feel the impact will be minimized."

We placed a number of capital units in U.S. and some of the Western markets in Europe. So the capital is in place and the sales team is in place. The outpatient reimbursement is quite healthy for that product, which is great, and they're building new clinical evidence. And there's -- near term here, the challenge continues to be access, having our teams accessible to the suites to really drive what is a kind of a behavior change in using a single-use scope. And so as COVID continues to improve, this will be a great growth driver for us in 2021 and we'll get better and better each quarter, just like we're seeing now. 
However, the ability for us to really turn on accounts and higher utilization is difficult given the limitations of some of the rep access and the hesitancy to modify kind of current practices in the COVID world. But we have seen some success, for sure, and our team, the reimbursement is very helpful. And as the year goes on, that will become a more meaningful growth driver each quarter for us. And we'll launch the bronchoscope in the second half of 2021, and we believe this will be a nice $2 billion market for us. And it's -- we think it will follow a very similar path ex COVID as our urology scope did as well as our SpyGlass Scope and Endo as well. 
So we have a lot of experience there. We know how to make these devices. You'll see enhancements to EXALT-D likely in the second half of the year as well. And as COVID continues to wane down, that business will accelerate in '21."

They grew 5% with COVID impact in fourth quarter. They have the most differentiated portfolio in arterial with the Ranger balloon and Eluvia, including the NTAP with Eluvia. And we expect that business, as I mentioned, will more than double. It will exceed $150 million this year. So we're really well positioned there. 
The venous space continues to grow extremely well. And then in Interventional Oncology, which is really the gem that we acquired with BTG. It's really exceeded expectations in terms of sales results. Now we're expanding it more aggressively in Europe and Asia Pac. Just got some great reimbursement in Korea, Poland and some other countries. We're expanding indications there.

So we have no shortage of product launches that we're launching right now that will impact '22 as well. 
In terms of the clinical trial, I would say it's a bit mixed. The WATCHMAN clinical trials have ramped very quickly with the OPTION trial, the CHAMPION trial starting. Some of the trials that require new therapies have been a bit slower. We are excited about the mitral approval in the -- to begin that clinical trial in the U.S., which is a nice win for us. We had some challenges trying to do that overseas given the COVID impact. The EXALT-D, we already talked about. 
So I would say it's a bit of a kind of a mixed result depending on which business you're in. But in some of the markets maybe about a 6-month impact in terms of enrollment timing. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for ACURATE, we're enrolling the U.S. trial for cryo.

We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. And organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are no comparable period net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventive, which closed March 1, 2020, and Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicine, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed March 1, 2021, and the Global Embolic Micro shares portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Guidance excludes the recently announced LUMINIZE Surgical acquisition and the BTG Specialty Pharmaceutical businesses, which, as I mentioned, was divested as of March 1, 2021, one month earlier than originally anticipated. 
For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. 
On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. 
Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8%, excluding COVID, represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.

I'm pleased to report a good start to 2021, with a return to growth versus both '20 and '19, financial results that exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS, and multiple significant clinical milestones, and continued advancement of our category leadership strategy, with new product launches and tuck-in M&A, including preventive and cardiac diagnostics, and LUMINIZE which is a leader in laser technology for kidney stones. 
Total company first quarter operational sales grew 5.6% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 6% vers '20 and 3% vers '19, exceeding expectations, as the second half of the quarter came in stronger than anticipated on procedure recovery and market share gains across many of our businesses and regions. 
Many of these gains were fueled by new and ongoing product launches, most [ double by ] our Ranger DCB, Eluvia DES, POLARx catheter, Lux Dx implantable cardiac monitor and their precise Genus deep brain stimulation platform. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 grew 33% versus '20 and 5% vers '19, which exceeds the high end of guidance by $0.03, primarily due to higher sales performance and spend controls. Adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was in line with our expectations and demonstrate solid progress from 2020. And we're really pleased with our free cash flow generation of $213 million and adjusted free cash flow of $404 million. 
We believe these better than expected results are indicative of our ability to regain our pre-pandemic 6-year track record of excellent performance, as we execute against our strategic plan objectives and drive towards ex COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic sales growth, continued operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and importantly, an improved ability to deploy our healthy free cash flow. 
We're encouraged by the outlook of the rest of the year. And we're emerging from the headwinds of the pandemic well positioned, given our category leadership positions, innovative pipeline, commercial execution, enhanced digital capabilities and ongoing expansion into higher-growth markets. And we look forward to highlighting these capabilities with you further at our Investor Day this year, which will be held on Wednesday, September 22. 
So looking ahead, we continue to expect a steady recovery from the pandemic, with less of an impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter versus first quarter and more normal procedure levels in second half '21. 
Given the first quarter outperformance, we're narrowing the range for both full year organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. So compared to 2020, we're targeting second quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 44% to 48% and full year plus 15% to plus 18%. Compared to '19, we're targeting second quarter organic revenue growth of 3% to 6% and for the full year growth of 2% to 5%. Our second quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.36 to $0.38. And we're updating full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.53 to $1.60. Dan will also give the revenue contribution from Preventice, and we continue to expect second half '21 close for Luminus. 
So I'll provide some additional highlights in first quarter '21, along with some commentary on second quarter and the outlook. 
So regionally, in the first quarter, on an operational basis versus '20: the U.S. grew 9%; Asia Pac grew 9%; Middle East, Africa grew 2%; and the emerging market sales grew 13%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by procedure recovery, particularly in March, along with new product launches across the entire portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa was driven by new product innovations, with particular strength in PI, EP and Endo, as the majority of markets grew in the first quarter versus first quarter '19, even as some countries experienced lockdowns and related procedural impacts. In Asia, every market grew in the first quarter versus first quarter '20. And going forward in Japan, despite COVID uncertainties, we expect full year growth versus 2019, thanks to the diversified portfolio and new product launches, such as Ranger DCB, Stable Point, WATCHMAN FLEX and LithoVue, which is expected later in the year. China sales grew 20% versus 2020 and were flat versus '19, which reflects the negative impact of tender pricing for drug moving stents and blows. The rest of the China portfolio saw strong double-digit growth in first quarter versus '19, with particularly notable momentum behind both complex PCI and imaging products as well as Endo euro and PI. We continue to expect full year '21 double-digit growth for China versus both 2020 and 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. 
Urology and Public Health continued to expand market share, and sales grew organically 9% versus 2020. And first quarter growth was balanced regionally, with strength in stone and prostate health. Product highlights include continued momentum with space review hydrogel, which drove double-digit growth overall for the space business. Rezum also grew double-digits, fueled in part by the publication of the compelling 5-year results, demonstrating Rezum's durability, with a low 4.4% reintervention rate for BPH patients. And looking ahead, we're excited to continue to build out our stone portfolio and extend our global footprint with the acquisition of the surgical business of Luminus and its leading laser fiber technology. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year. 
For Endoscopy, sales grew organically 10% versus 2020. And Endo continues to grow market share globally, with double-digit growth in all regions versus '19, led by strength in key franchises, such as pancreatic biliary, hemostasis and infection prevention. And thanks to recent launches in our differentiated technologies, such as SpyGlass DS, Discover and Axios. EXALT momentum is gradually improving as we have started to see capacity differ hospitals to establish new protocols, hospital access has increased and the Medicare outpatient pass-through payment. We also continue to target launch of our single-use bronchoscope in the second half '21 and remain bullish on the long-term opportunity for single-use scopes broadly. 
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were up 1% organically versus 2020. And we believe that our CRM performance was slightly below the overall market. For the full year '21, we forecast a slight tailwind from the replacement cycle and anticipate beginning enrollment midyear in modular ATP, which is our dual-track clinical study for stand-alone levels pacemaker, as well as to provide pacing and pacing to patients. Our Lux Dx implantable cardiac monitor launch is gaining U.S. share, given its high-quality ECG signals, arrhythmia algorithm performance and streamlined back-end monitoring. 
We closed the Preventice acquisition as of March 1, and are pleased with the Preventice portfolio, which grew mid-20% on a pro forma basis for the full quarter. And despite recent reimbursement challenges in one segment of testing, long-term ECG, we expect plus 20% pro forma growth for Preventice in '21, given its ability to offer all 4 testing modalities with Body Guardian mini and excellent detection algorithms. We're excited to have such a unique position in the field of cardiac diagnostics and the ability to offer all diagnostic modalities, including the ambulatory ECG, Lux Dx, ICM and the HeartLogic detection alert for heart failure. 
Electrophysiology sales were up 8% versus 2020. In Polar X, which is our second-generation single-shot cryo catheter, is off to a strong start in Europe and taking share given its effectiveness and ease of use. Stable Point, our [ 4 ] Sensing therapeutic catheter with DirectSense has also enjoyed a good start in both Japan and Europe and has begun enrollment in its U.S. IDE trial called Newton AF. 
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020. And the first quarter result is an improvement sequentially despite the challenges of higher rates of spinal torsion patient cancellations in December, that also seeped into January and February due to the COVID surge. As patient reticence waned in March, trends improved significantly, and also by the ongoing launch of our NextGen WaveWriter Alpha SCS system. Alpha has driven excitement due to its fast and contour paresthesia-free wave forms, with MRI compatibility, which is also supported by our Cigniti software solutions that enhance the physician's ability to identify, manage and maintain SCS patients. 
In deep brain stimulation, our precise Genus platform expands our MRI capabilities in both the rechargeable and nonrechargeable segments, with Bluetooth communication capabilities. 
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 7% versus 2020. And every structural heart franchise, WATCHMAN, ACURATE neo II and Sentinel delivered strong growth. The WATCHMAN franchise accelerated its recovery, growing over 30% versus 2020, with extremely positive physician feedback on Flex device performance and safety, as supported by the PINNACLE FLX IDE study that was published in circulation during the quarter. 
Importantly, we completed the conversion to a consignment based model last quarter. And accounts in the U.S. are now over 90% converted to FLX. We've also seen a step-up in implants per center per week versus pre-COVID levels, as more physician implanters adopt the FLX technology. And we continue to push for indication expansion as we enroll the CHAMPION study and target enrollment completion of the OPTION trial by the end of the year. 
In TAVR, our ACURATE NEO 2 launch continues to do quite well in Europe. And we're pleased to announce that we've expanded our risk indication in our ACURATE NEO 2 IDE trial. The IDE trial now includes all risk categories, including low-risk TAVR patients. We continue to target U.S. approval for all risk indications and market entry in 2024. 
During the quarter, Sentinel, which is our cerebral embolic protection device, reached a milestone of treating 50,000 patients cumulatively and continue to enroll its PROTECT TAVR randomized trial. 
Coronary Therapies grew low single-digits versus 2020, with global strength in complex PCI and imaging. This helped to offset drug ruminant price weakness in the U.S. and China. And we continue to launch new products for complex PCI and are on track to begin enrollment in second quarter for the agent drug-coated balloon study, which is a first in the U.S. for coronary instant restenosis. And we're pleased that agent has been designated a breakthrough device. 
Peripheral Interventions delivered strong performance and continues to gain market share, with organic sales up 8% versus first quarter '20. 
And Interventional Oncology grew high single-digits versus first quarter '20, driven by the achievement of several important milestones for TheraSphere. These include the recent PMA approval in hepatic cellular carcinoma, as the positive TARGET study outcomes were featured as a late breaker at the Society for Interventional Radiology. In addition, we were granted a breakthrough device designation for the study of TheraSphere in patients suffering from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. 
Performance in our VENOUS franchise was led by mid-teens growth in ecos versus 2020. And in arterial, drug-eluting technologies also had a strong quarter, as growth accelerated sequentially, thanks to our category leadership strategy to offer both a differentiated DES and a DCB, as well as sectors continuing recovery at multiple data sets, proving the safety and effectiveness of these therapies. The Eluvia DES inpatient add-on payment and the ongoing U.S. launch of Ranger DCB are helping us to drive share gains. 
I'd also like to highlight 2 important sustainability accomplishments this quarter. 
The first is the publication of our performance report and its detailed addendum, referencing the global reporting initiative guidelines. And secondly, placed an [ 8th ] on the Forbes list of America's best employers for diversity in 2021. We remain as committed as ever to global sustainable economic, environmental and social practices. 
And overall, we're pleased with our early performance for the year and optimistic on the outlook. We continue to drive towards ex COVID financial goals of 6% to 8% organic growth, margin expansion, driving strong cash flow and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, while living our values with an enduring commitment to sustainable business practices. 
Very grateful for our employees for their winning spirit. And I'll now turn things over to Dan."

On an operational basis, revenue growth was 5.6% in the quarter. Sales from the Preve",989,"Thanks, Mike. 
First quarter consolidated revenue of $2.752 billion represents 8.2% reported revenue growth and reflects a $67 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 5.6% in the quarter. 
Sales from the Preventice acquisition, which closed March 1, contributed 70 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and our Intrauterine Health franchise, resulting in 5.9% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of down 3% to up 3% versus 2020. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2019, organic growth was 3%, above our guidance range of down 6% to flat. This 3% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of divested Intrauterine Health and Embolic Beads businesses as well as $160 million in 2021 sale of acquired businesses, which consists of 1 month of Preventice, 2 months of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines and Vertiflex. 
Top line results drove Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, representing 33% growth versus 2020, 5% growth versus 2019, and exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.34. 
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 68.9%, slightly below our expectations, driven by inventory charges and lower sales within higher-margin businesses. As expected, the COVID driven negative manufacturing variances capitalized on the balance sheet in 2020 should be substantially recognized in the P&L by the end of the second quarter, enabling higher gross margins in the second half of the year. 
First quarter adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, slightly above our expectations, driven by strong sales and spend control, as SG&A and R&D remained slightly below historical levels as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to below the line. 
Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $97 million, in line with our expectations. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 5.9% on an adjusted basis, and includes 240 basis points of benefit from discrete tax items within the quarter as well as a 190 basis point benefit from stock compensation accounting, higher than previously expected. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million. And free cash flow was $213 million, with $284 million from operating activities, less $71 million of net capital expenditures. Our goal is to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020, despite increased working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable as we return to more normalized volumes during the remainder of 2021. 
As of March 2021, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&A. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities, while continuing to remain active with our venture capital portfolio and consider opportunistic share repurchase. We ended Q1 with 1.431 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
And now I'll walk through the guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. 
For the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, which includes an approximate net 100 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 15% to 18% versus 2020 and 2% to 5% versus 2019. 
For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our Embolic Beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $480 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including: Vertiflex through May; BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August; and Preventice as of March; as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture. 
For Q2 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 42% to 46%, which includes an approximate net 200 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 44% to 48% versus 2020 and 3% to 6% growth versus 2019. 
For the organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $15 million in sales of our Embolic Beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $175 million in sales from the acquisitions of Vertiflex, BTG Interventional Medicines and Preventice. 
For adjusted operating margin, while we aim for sequential improvement, we expect Q2 to be similar to Q1, as we remain flexible with investment opportunities and given strong Q1 performance. Our goal is to average 26% adjusted operating margin in the back half of the year, setting us up to exit 2021 at a higher level than full year 2019. 
We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 10% due to the Q1 discrete tax benefits and more stock compensation favorability than previously anticipated. We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program, to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect fully diluted weighted average share counts of approximately 1.435 billion shares for Q2 2021 and 1.436 billion for full year 2021. We are now raising the low end of our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.53, and maintaining the high end of $1.60, in line with our update to sales guidance as Q1 results have removed some uncertainty from our previously wider range. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.36 to $0.38. 
Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q1 results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

You expect an improvement on that same basis to 3% to 6% in Q2 and 2% to 5% for the full year. 
My question is, that suggests kind of very little incremental growth in the back half versus the first half. So is that simply conservatism? Or is there something going on in the back half that we should be aware of?"

I mean we believe the guidance is appropriate. And I think you're correct. I mean the best way to look at it is probably versus 2019 to eliminate the COVID impact in the base year. And so the way I think of it is, you look at Q1, and that was 3%, right? You look at Q2, and at the midpoint, that's 4.5%. So that's a nice acceleration. You heard Mike talk about the recovery And we look for that recovery to continue in Q2. So the midpoint is at 4.5%. And then if you look at the full year range of 2% to 5%, and you take the high end of 5%, that implies that we're north of 6% in both of Q3 and Q4. And so that's a nice acceleration from where we would be in Q2 at the midpoint. And also, it's worth noting that the comps versus '19 are 200 basis points higher in the second half. So our comps for '19 were 6% and 6% in the first half, Q1 and Q2, so obviously, an average of 6%. And then in the back half, they were 9% and 7%, for an average of 8%. So if you look at the high end of the 5% and you say that implies that we're north of 6%. That's in the range of that 6% to 8% that we always talk about ex COVID for our expectations. So we feel like, as we look at the 2% to 5% full year and then also the Q2 3% to 6%, we think it's appropriate."

That's really despite some of the lockdowns that you've seen. So in some markets like the U.K., the business has been stronger. The business has picked up in Germany. Some countries like Italy and Spain have been a bit softer. So we do anticipate those markets to get better as we expand over the second quarter, given improvements in vaccination like we've seen in the U.S. But I would say the COVID impact in Europe has been more choppy given the slightly slower pace of vaccine rollout and some of the lockdowns in some of the countries. But nevertheless, the team did deliver positive growth versus '20 and '19. And in Japan, really a similar story. vaccination rates are a bit lower there. But nevertheless, the team did grow versus '19 at 1%, which is encouraging. And we expect that business to strengthen as the year moves on. And that's supported by a number of product launches in Japan, primarily the DCB and Eluvia the stable plan platform as well as some additional launches in urology. So the U.S. was the strongest market overall. China performed very well and some choppiness in Europe with some of the lockdowns, but the team delivered nice growth there."

And we saw quite a bit of softness in the first half of the quarter, really through most of February, particularly in SCS. And then we saw a significant improvement in March. And so we're quite bullish on that business, particularly in the U.S. where the bulk of that business is in the U.S. in SES in second quarter and second half. And so we think that will be quite a bit stronger than it was in 2019 and stronger than it was in the first half [ of ] first quarter. And Urology numbers were quite strong in the first quarter.

And so we did see a little bit of softness in CRM in the quarter. We think we may have lost a little bit of share. At sequential quarter-over-quarter growth versus '20, it's very minimal share loss. And it's typically -- it's been common in the leadless pacemaker market where we -- although the share loss, I would say, has reduced or more stabilized, as we think that segment is approaching full penetration in terms of the single chamber. So although we lost share there, I would say that element is declining. And we had a little bit of softness in DFI with actions, but that business is beginning to rebound, and Dr. Stein can comment on it. 
Importantly, as you said, our full diagnostic portfolio with Preventice and Lux and the acceptance of Lux will be a nice tailwind for us in '21 and '22. And our EP business was quite strong in Europe, softer in the U.S. where we don't have some of these product approvals. So net-net, as you said, the diagnostics business will help offset some of the softness in CRM and EP in Europe and Japan, in particular, will offset some of the U.S. So those are certainly additive and beneficial to the CRM growth profile. 
And maybe, Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on ACD."

So the Luminus acquisition is excluded from guidance that has not closed. So you are correct, that's excluded. And the way -- we obviously think of operating margin at the bottom line with all the individual components of gross margin and SG&A and R&D. But specific to gross margin, we wanted to be approaching 70 in Q1. We ended up, as I said, slightly short of that because of some inventory charges and some lower sales in some of the higher-margin businesses. Obviously, you look at Neuromod [ has ] one of the best gross margins of our businesses, and that was the most impacted by COVID. So confident that as we go into Q2, we'll get back to that, approaching 70. And then as you get into the second half, we're not going to get back to the 2019 levels of 72 4, but we should see improvement, partially because the COVID inefficiencies and some of the things that are specific to COVID should start to dissipate. But also that's normally what happens in a year, where we have the first half margins from a gross margin perspective are almost always lower than the second half because we have the inventory revaluation that happens in the first half. And if you look back over the last 4 or 5 years, second half gross margin is always better than the the first half. So we believe that trend will continue. So if you think of second quarter approaching 70, and then better than that in the second half, and that gets back to the overall adjusted operating margin commentary that says we want to get back to averaging 26 in the back half of 2021, which is in line with the overall full year 2019 levels, which should set us up well for '22 and beyond."

I just met with the team last week in Minnesota. So the business performed quite well in the first quarter. And we're quite bullish on that business going forward. You've heard the strategy before. We think we're differentiated. We're the only company that can offer the full range of diagnostic modalities different ones within the Preventive sub portfolio. And then combine that with the ICM business that we have in HeartLogic on our ICDs. So we think that provides a differentiated suite of diagnostic tools for physicians. 
And the beauty of the Preventice platform is they're able to toggle between different diagnostic modalities within the same device. And so they have quite sophisticated algorithms that can all be done remotely. And so although there's some pressure, as you mentioned, in the extended [ Holter ] in terms of reimbursement, the other parts of that business continue to grow. And due to the inherent flexibility of the platform, you're able to modulate patients into these different modalities, depending on what the patient need may be or maybe the reimbursement circumstance. So I think that capability provides us a lot of flexibility And you tie together with our Lux Lupica, which is doing quite well, it gives us a strong portfolio.

Some countries are are more normal, not quite normal, but more normalized based on vaccine rates. And some, as you know, Italy and others have been more unlocked down.

And we're really just kind of chunking these out and making enhancements all the time. You've seen improved reimbursement in the outpatient setting. There's been some news recently just last night on the NTAP for EXALT that just -- I think it was just published yesterday or this -- early this morning, which will help with reimbursement in the inpatient center. So you're seeing stronger improved reimbursement capabilities in general for the EXALT-D, with the TPT and now the NTAP, which is an exciting news. 
And on the device itself, it's a 510(k) device. And so with that, the team will continue to make enhancement to that platform like we've done with LithoVue and Spy, too. So you'll see some additional enhancements to the product in the second half of 2021. 
And the other pieces you mentioned is impacted by COVID. And so now we are seeing some improvement in there. We're placing more capital. And you're seeing some stronger uptake in March than we had earlier. And so we're bullish on it.

And with an aging population, an increasing burden of heart failure, and heart failure being a driver to mitral regurgitation, this is a huge global opportunity, and indeed, a multibillion dollar opportunity. So I think the prevalence and the global demography really point to this being a significant opportunity. 
The mitral valve and the aortic valve are very differently, in mitral valve, as you well know, is a complex structure. So there's no one single device that will actually serve to treat mitral valve disease. As we often say, the only similarity between the aortic and the mitral valve is the word valve. The rest is completely different. So [ March ] will requires a toolbox approach, if you like, in order to treat that. So The foundation though, the most important foundation for treating mitral valve disease, particularly functional mitral regurgitation, is the nanobody device. And that's why we are focused on a transvenous transseptal mitral multicity device. This is a permissive technology that allow us there you to add in whatever other appropriate strategy is needed to tailor the solution for the mitral part disease.

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earl",520,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. 
The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q1 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q2 and fiscal year 2021 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q2 and fiscal '21 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. And organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are no comparable period net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, which closed March 1, 2020, and Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicine, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Guidance excludes the recently announced LUMINIZE Surgical acquisition and the BTG Specialty Pharmaceutical businesses, which, as I mentioned, was divested as of March 1, 2021, one month earlier than originally anticipated. 
For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. 
On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. 
Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8%, excluding COVID, represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates; R&D spend and other expenses. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. 
At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?"
317627,709358111,2261035,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Susie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a good start to 2021, with a return to growth versus both '20 and '19. Financial results that exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS, and multiple significant cl",1972,"Thanks, Susie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
I'm pleased to report a good start to 2021, with a return to growth versus both '20 and '19. Financial results that exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS, and multiple significant clinical milestones, and continued advancement of our category leadership strategy, with new product launches and tuck-in M&A, including Preventice in cardiac diagnostics, and LUMINIZE which is a leader in laser technology for kidney stones. 
Total company first quarter operational sales grew 5.6% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 6% versus '20 and 3% versus '19, exceeding expectations, as the second half of the quarter came in stronger than anticipated on procedure recovery and market share gains across many of our businesses and regions. 
Many of these gains were fueled by new and ongoing product launches, most notably our Ranger DCB, Eluvia DES, POLARx Catheter, LUX-Dx Implantable Cardiac Monitor and their Vercise Genus Deep Brain Stimulation Platform. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 grew 33% versus '20 and 5% versus '19, which exceeds the high end of guidance by $0.03, primarily due to higher sales performance and spend controls. Adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was in line with our expectations and demonstrate solid progress from 2020. And we're really pleased with our free cash flow generation of $213 million and adjusted free cash flow of $404 million. 
We believe these better than expected results are indicative of our ability to regain our pre-pandemic 6-year track record of excellent performance, as we execute against our strategic plan objectives and drive towards ex-COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic sales growth, continued operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and importantly, an improved ability to deploy our healthy free cash flow. 
We're encouraged by the outlook of the rest of the year. And we're emerging from the headwinds of the pandemic well positioned, given our category leadership positions, innovative pipeline, commercial execution, enhanced digital capabilities and ongoing expansion into higher-growth markets. And we look forward to highlighting these capabilities with you further at our Investor Day this year, which will be held on Wednesday, September 22. 
So looking ahead, we continue to expect a steady recovery from the pandemic, with less of an impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter versus first quarter and more normal procedure levels in second half '21. Given the first quarter outperformance, we're narrowing the range for both full year organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. So compared to 2020, we're targeting second quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 44% to 48% and full year plus 15% to plus 18%. Compared to '19, we're targeting second quarter organic revenue growth of 3% to 6% and for the full year growth of 2% to 5%. 
Our second quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.36 to $0.38. And we're updating full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.53 to $1.60. Dan will also give the revenue contribution from Preventice, and we continue to expect second half '21 close for LUMINIZE. 
So I'll now provide some additional highlights in first quarter '21, along with some commentary on second quarter and the outlook. So regionally, in the first quarter, on an operational basis versus '20: the U.S. grew 9%; Asia Pac grew 9%; Middle East, Africa grew 2%; and the emerging market sales grew 13%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by procedure recovery, particularly in March, along with new product launches across the entire portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa was driven by new product innovations, with particular strength in PI, EP and endo, as the majority of markets grew in the first quarter versus first quarter '19, even as some countries experienced lockdowns and related procedural impacts. 
In Asia, every market grew in the first quarter versus first quarter '20. And going forward in Japan, despite COVID uncertainties, we expect full year growth versus 2019, thanks to the diversified portfolio and new product launches, such as Ranger DCB, StablePoint, WATCHMAN FLX and LithoVue, which is expected later in the year. China sales grew 20% versus 2020 and were flat versus '19, which reflects the negative impact of tender pricing for drug moving stents and blows. The rest of the China portfolio saw strong double-digit growth in first quarter versus '19, with particularly notable momentum behind both complex PCI and imaging products as well as endo, euro and PI. We continue to expect full year '21 double-digit growth for China versus both 2020 and 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. Urology and public health continued to expand market share, and sales grew organically 9% versus 2020. And first quarter growth was balanced regionally, with strength in stone and prostate health. Product highlights include continued momentum with SpaceOAR Vue Hydrogel, which drove double-digit growth overall for the SpaceOAR business. Rezum also grew double-digits, fueled in part by the publication of the compelling 5-year results, demonstrating Rezum's durability, with a low 4.4% reintervention rate for BPH patients. And looking ahead, we're excited to continue to build out our stone portfolio and extend our global footprint with the acquisition of the surgical business of LUMINIZE and its leading laser fiber technology. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year. 
For Endoscopy, sales grew organically 10% versus 2020. And Endo continues to grow market share globally, with double-digit growth in all regions versus '19, led by strength in key franchises, such as pancreaticobiliary, hemostasis and infection prevention. And thanks to recent launches in our differentiated technologies, such as SpyGlass DS, Discover and AXIOS. EXALT-D momentum is gradually improving as we have started to see capacity differ hospitals to establish new protocols, hospital access has increased and the Medicare outpatient pass-through payment. We also continue to target launch of our single-use bronchoscope in the second half '21, and remain bullish on the long-term opportunity for single-use scopes broadly. 
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were up 1% organically versus 2020. And we believe that our CRM performance was slightly below the overall market. For the full year '21, we forecast a slight tailwind from the replacement cycle and anticipate beginning enrollment midyear in modular ATP, which is our dual-track clinical study for stand-alone leadless pacemaker, as well as to provide pacing and antitachycardia pacing to EMBLEM S-ICD patients. Our LUX-Dx implantable cardiac monitor launch is gaining U.S. share, given its high-quality ECG signals, arrhythmia algorithm performance and streamlined back-end monitoring. 
We closed the Preventice acquisition as of March 1, and are pleased with the Preventice portfolio, which grew mid-20% on a pro forma basis for the full quarter. And despite recent reimbursement challenges in 1 segment of testing, long-term ECG, we expect plus 20% pro forma growth for Preventice in '21, given its ability to offer all 4 testing modalities with Bodyguardian Mini and excellent detection algorithms. We're excited to have such a unique position in the field of cardiac diagnostics and the ability to offer all diagnostic modalities, including the ambulatory ECG, LUX-Dx, ICM and the HeartLogic detection alert for heart failure. 
Electrophysiology sales were up 8% versus 2020. And In POLARx, which is our second-generation single-shot cryo catheter, is off to a strong start in Europe and taking share given its effectiveness and ease of use. StablePoint, our Force Sensing therapeutic catheter with DIRECTSENSE is also enjoying a good start in both Japan and Europe and has begun enrollment in its U.S. IDE trial called NEwTON AF. 
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020. And the first quarter result is an improvement sequentially despite the challenges of higher rates of spinal cord stimulation patient cancellations in December that also seeped into January and February due to the COVID surge. As patient reticence waned in March, trends improved significantly, and also helped by the ongoing launch of our next-gen WaveWriter Alpha SCS system. Alpha has driven excitement due to its FAST and Contour paresthesia-free wave forms with MRI compatibility, which is also supported by our Cognita software solutions that enhance the physician's ability to identify, manage and maintain SCS patients. In deep brain stimulation, our Vercise Genus platform expands our MRI capabilities in both the rechargeable and nonrechargeable segments, with Bluetooth communication capabilities. 
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 7% versus 2020. And every structural heart franchise, WATCHMAN, ACURATE neo2 and SENTINEL delivered strong growth. The WATCHMAN franchise accelerated its recovery, growing over 30% versus 2020, with extremely positive physician feedback on FLX device performance and safety, as supported by the PINNACLE FLX IDE study that was published in Circulation during the quarter. 
Importantly, we completed the conversion to a consignment-based model last quarter. And accounts in the U.S. are now over 90% converted to FLX. We've also seen a step-up in implants per center per week versus pre-COVID levels, as more physician implanters adopt the FLX technology. And we continue to push for indication expansion as we enroll the CHAMPION study and target enrollment completion of the OPTION trial by the end of the year. 
In TAVR, our ACURATE neo2 2 launch continues to do quite well in Europe. And we're pleased to announce that we've expanded our risk indication in our ACURATE neo2 IDE trial. The IDE trial now includes all risk categories, including low-risk TAVR patients. We continue to target U.S. approval for all risk indications and market entry in 2024. 
During the quarter, SENTINEL, which is our cerebral embolic protection device, reached a milestone of treating 50,000 patients cumulatively and continue to enroll its Protected TAVR randomized trial. 
Coronary therapies grew low single-digits versus 2020, with global strength in complex PCI and imaging. This helped to offset drug-eluting stent price weakness in the U.S. and China. And we continue to launch new products for complex PCI, and are on track to begin enrollment in second quarter for the AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon study, which is a first in the U.S. for coronary in-stent restenosis. And we're pleased that AGENT has been designated a Breakthrough Device. 
Peripheral Interventions delivered strong performance and continues to gain market share, with organic sales up 8% versus first quarter '20. And Interventional Oncology grew high single-digits versus first quarter '20, driven by the achievement of several important milestones for TheraSphere. These include the recent PMA approval in hepatic cellular carcinoma, as the positive TARGET study outcomes were featured as a late breaker at the Society for Interventional Radiology. In addition, we were granted a Breakthrough Device Designation for the study of TheraSphere in patients suffering from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. 
Performance in our VENOUS franchise was led by mid-teens growth in ecos versus 2020. And in arterial, drug-eluting technologies also had a strong quarter, as growth accelerated sequentially, thanks to our category leadership strategy to offer both a differentiated DES and a DCB, as well as sectors continuing recovery at multiple data sets, proving the safety and effectiveness of these therapies. The Eluvia DES inpatient add-on payment and the ongoing U.S. launch of Ranger DCB are helping us to drive share gains. 
I'd also like to highlight 2 important sustainability accomplishments this quarter. The first is the publication of our performance report and its detailed addendum, referencing the global reporting initiative guidelines. And secondly, placed an 8th on the Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Diversity in 2021. We remain as committed as ever to global sustainable economic, environmental and social practices. 
And overall, we're pleased with our early performance for the year and optimistic on the outlook. We continue to drive towards ex-COVID financial goals of 6% to 8% organic growth, margin expansion, driving strong cash flow and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, while living our values with an enduring commitment to sustainable business practices. 
Very grateful for our employees for their winning spirit. And I'll now turn things over to Dan."

First quarter consolidated revenue of $2.752 billion represents 8.2% reported revenue growth and reflects a $67 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 5.6% in the quarter. 
Sales from the Preventice acquisition, which closed March 1, contributed 70 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and our Intrauterine Health franchise, resulting in 5.9% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of down 3% to up 3% versus 2020. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2019, organic growth was 3%, above our guidance range of down 6% to flat. This 3% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of divested Intrauterine Health and embolic beads businesses as well as $160 million in 2021 sale of acquired businesses, which consists of 1 month of Preventice, 2 months of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines and Vertiflex. 
Top line results drove Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, representing 33% growth versus 2020, 5% growth versus 2019, and exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.34. 
Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 68.9%, slightly below our expectations, driven by inventory charges and lower sales within higher-margin businesses. As expected, the COVID-driven negative manufacturing variances capitalized on the balance sheet in 2020 should be substantially recognized in the P&L by the end of the second quarter, enabling higher gross margins in the second half of the year. 
First quarter adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, slightly above our expectations, driven by strong sales and spend control, as SG&A and R&D remained slightly below historical levels as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $97 million, in line with our expectations. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 5.9% on an adjusted basis, and includes 240 basis points of benefit from discrete tax items within the quarter as well as a 190 basis point benefit from stock compensation accounting, higher than previously expected. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million. And free cash flow was $213 million, with $284 million from operating activities, less $71 million of net capital expenditures. Our goal is to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020, despite increased working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable as we return to more normalized volumes during the remainder of 2021. 
As of March 2021, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&A. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities, while continuing to remain active with our venture capital portfolio and consider opportunistic share repurchase. We ended Q1 with 1.431 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
And now I'll walk through the guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. For the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, which includes an approximate net 100 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 15% to 18% versus 2020 and 2% to 5% versus 2019. 
For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $480 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including: Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August, and Preventice as of March as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture. 
For Q2 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 42% to 46%, which includes an approximate net 200 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 44% to 48% versus 2020 and 3% to 6% growth versus 2019. 
For the organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $15 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health franchise. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $175 million in sales from the acquisitions of Vertiflex, BTG Interventional Medicines and Preventice. 
For adjusted operating margin, while we aim for sequential improvement, we expect Q2 to be similar to Q1, as we remain flexible with investment opportunities and given strong Q1 performance. Our goal is to average 26% adjusted operating margin in the back half of the year, setting us up to exit 2021 at a higher level than full year 2019. 
We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 10% due to the Q1 discrete tax benefits and more stock compensation favorability than previously anticipated. We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program, to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. 
We expect fully diluted weighted average share counts of approximately 1.435 billion shares for Q2 2021 and 1.436 billion for full year 2021. We are now raising the low end of our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.53, and maintaining the high end of $1.60, in line with our update to sales guidance as Q1 results have removed some uncertainty from our previously wider range. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.36 to $0.38. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q1 results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A."

But to keep it simple, I think you said your organic sales growth in the first quarter of 2021 over the first quarter of 2019 was 3%. You expect an improvement on that same basis to 3% to 6% in Q2 and 2% to 5% for the full year. 
My question is, that suggests kind of very little incremental growth in the back half versus the first half. So is that simply conservatism? Or is there something going on in the back half that we should be aware of?"

I mean we believe the guidance is appropriate. And I think you're correct. I mean the best way to look at it is probably versus 2019 to eliminate the COVID impact in the base year. And so the way I think of it is, you look at Q1, and that was 3%, right? You look at Q2, and at the midpoint, that's 4.5%. So that's a nice acceleration. You heard Mike talk about the recovery And we look for that recovery to continue in Q2. So the midpoint is at 4.5%. 
And then if you look at the full year range of 2% to 5%, and you take the high end of 5%, that implies that we're north of 6% in both of Q3 and Q4. And so that's a nice acceleration from where we would be in Q2 at the midpoint. And also, it's worth noting that the comps versus '19 are 200 basis points higher in the second half. So our comps for '19 were 6% and 6% in the first half, Q1 and Q2, so obviously, an average of 6%. And then in the back half, they were 9% and 7%, for an average of 8%. So if you look at the high end of the 5% and you say that implies that we're north of 6%. That's in the range of that 6% to 8% that we always talk about ex-COVID for our expectations. So we feel like, as we look at the 2% to 5% full year and then also the Q2, 3% to 6%, we think it's appropriate."

Some countries like Italy and Spain have been a bit softer. So we do anticipate those markets to get better as we expand over the second quarter, given improvements in vaccination like we've seen in the U.S. But I would say the COVID impact in Europe has been more choppy given the slightly slower pace of vaccine rollout and some of the lockdowns in some of the countries. 
But nevertheless, the team did deliver positive growth versus '20 and '19. And in Japan, really a similar story. Vaccination rates are a bit lower there. But nevertheless, the team did grow versus '19 at 1%, which is encouraging. And we expect that business to strengthen as the year moves on. And that's supported by a number of product launches in Japan, primarily the DCB and Eluvia, the StablePoint platform as well as some additional launches in urology. So the U.S. was the strongest market overall. China performed very well and some choppiness in Europe with some of the lockdowns, but the team delivered nice growth there."

We obviously try to frame it with our guidance for second quarter, which we anticipate acceleration over first quarter just if you take the midpoint. And so that obviously implies improvement in the -- strengthening of the business. And overall, you saw -- our most susceptible businesses to COVID, all of them were susceptible, but the most sensitive were Urology and Neuromodulation. And we saw quite a bit of softness in the first half of the quarter, really through most of February, particularly in SCS. And then we saw a significant improvement in March. And so we're quite bullish on that business, particularly in the U.S. where the bulk of that business is in the U.S. in SCS in second quarter and second half. 
And so we think that will be quite a bit stronger than it was in 2019 and stronger than it was in the first half -- first quarter. And Urology, you saw the Urology numbers were quite strong in the first quarter. So I think, to answer your question is a bit difficult. With the COVID improvement, we anticipate continued momentum based on the guidance that we gave, but it's difficult to predict additional bonuses on top of that."

And it's typically -- it's been common in the leadless pacemaker market where we -- although the share loss, I would say, has reduced or more stabilized, as we think that segment is approaching full penetration in terms of the single chamber. So although we lost share there, I would say that element is declining. And we had a little bit of softness in defib with the S-ICD actions, but that business is beginning to rebound, and Dr. Stein can comment on it. 
Importantly, as you said, our full diagnostic portfolio with Preventice and LUX and the acceptance of LUX will be a nice tailwind for us in '21 and '22. And our EP business was quite strong in Europe, softer in the U.S. where we don't have some of these product approvals. So net-net, as you said, the diagnostics business will help offset some of the softness in CRM.

So the LUMINIZE acquisition is excluded from guidance that has not closed. So you are correct, that's excluded. And the way -- we obviously think of operating margin at the bottom line with all the individual components of gross margin and SG&A and R&D. But specific to gross margin, we wanted to be approaching 70% in Q1. We ended up, as I said, slightly short of that because of some inventory charges and some lower sales in some of the higher-margin businesses. Obviously, you look at Neuromod, has one of the best gross margins of our businesses, and that was the most impacted by COVID. So confident that as we go into Q2, we'll get back to that, approaching 70%. And then as you get into the second half, we're not going to get back to the 2019 levels of 72.4%, but we should see improvement, partially because the COVID inefficiencies and some of the things that are specific to COVID should start to dissipate. But also that's normally what happens in a year, where we have the first half margins from a gross margin perspective are almost always lower than the second half because we have the inventory revaluation that happens in the first half. 
And if you look back over the last 4 or 5 years, second half gross margin is always better than the  first half. So we believe that trend will continue. So if you think of second quarter approaching 70%, and then better than that in the second half, and that gets back to the overall adjusted operating margin commentary that says we want to get back to averaging 26% in the back half of 2021, which is in line with the overall full year 2019 levels, which should set us up well for '22 and beyond."

I just met with the team last week in Minnesota. So the business performed quite well in the first quarter. And we're quite bullish on that business going forward. You've heard the strategy before. We think we're differentiated. We're the only company that can offer the full range of diagnostic modalities, 4 different ones within the Preventice portfolio. And then combine that with the ICM business that we have in HeartLogic and our ICDs. So we think that provides a differentiated suite of diagnostic tools for physicians. 
And the beauty of the Preventice platform is they're able to toggle between different diagnostic modalities within the same device. And so they have quite sophisticated algorithms that can all be done remotely. And so although there's some pressure, as you mentioned, in the extended halter in terms of reimbursement, the other parts of that business continue to grow. And due to the inherent flexibility of the platform, we're able to modulate patients into these different modalities, depending on what the patient need may be or maybe the reimbursement circumstance.

As you know, started off with LithoVue and SpyGlass, that had some similar commentary to EXALT-D. And that added some of the commentary 3, 4 years ago, if you recall. And so we're quite committed to this segment. We've seen the benefit of LithoVue and SpyGlass. And we expect similar results over time with EXALT-D. And we're really just kind of chunking these out and making enhancements all the time. You've seen improved reimbursement in the outpatient setting. There's been some news recently just last night on the NTAP for EXALT-D that just -- I think it was just published yesterday or this -- early this morning, which will help with reimbursement in the inpatient center. So you're seeing stronger improved reimbursement capabilities in general for the EXALT-D, with the TPT and now the NTAP, which is an exciting news. 
And on the device itself, it's a 510(k) device. And so with that, the team will continue to make enhancement to that platform like we've done with LithoVue and Spy, too. So you'll see some additional enhancements to the product in the second half of 2021. 
And the other pieces you mentioned is impacted by COVID. And so now we are seeing some improvement in there. We're placing more capital. And we're seeing some stronger uptake in March than we had earlier. And so we're bullish on it. It's not going to be a -- we expect a steady improvement and a steady growth cadence of this rather than a hockey stick. But the improved reimbursement, COVID subsiding over time will certainly help the dynamics of this business in -- throughout '21."

First, the mitral valve disease, particularly mitral regurgitation, is at the least 3x more prevalent than aortic stenosis. And with an aging population, an increasing burden of heart failure, and heart failure being a driver to mitral regurgitation, this is a huge global opportunity, and indeed, a multibillion dollar opportunity. So I think the prevalence and the global demography really point to this being a significant opportunity. 
The mitral valve and the aortic valve are very differently. Mitral valve, as you well know, is a complex structure. So there's no one single device that will actually serve to treat mitral valve disease. As we often say, the only similarity between the aortic and the mitral valve is the word valve. The rest is completely different. So mitral requires a toolbox approach, if you like, in order to treat that. So the foundation though -- the most important foundation for treating mitral valve disease, particularly functional mitral regurgitation is an annuloplasty device. 
And that's why we are focused on a transvenous transseptal mitral annuloplasty device. This is a permissive technology that allow there you to add in whatever other appropriate strategy is needed to tailor the solution for the mitral valve disease. So we have a thoughtful strategy as to how we can build out the toolbox approach note to effectively treat what is the largest single valve condition on the planet."

Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $838 million, and free cash flow was $541 million. $643 million from operating activities, less $102 million of net capital expenditures. All remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020 of approximately $2 billion.

We ended Q2 with 1,432 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2020. In the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50 basis point headwind from divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of [indiscernible]. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect to manage revenue growth [indiscernible] 20% versus 2020 [indiscernible] versus 6% to 7% versus 2019. 
organic comparison to 2019 full year 2019 sales million [indiscernible] sales of our evolving portfolio in intrefranchises as well as $1 million in specialty pharmaceutical sales. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $409 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex, May rental medicines through mid-August and provided as remarks as well as $13 million of [Audio Gap] 
specialty pharmaceutic sales prior to divestiture. Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range to 13% versus 2020 includes an approvement 100 basis point headwind from erspecialty Pharmaceutical, partially offset by the acquisition -- Excluding the impact of expenditures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% versus 2020 and 5% to 7% on growth versus 2019 which includes a 300 basis point sequential comp headwind in Q2 to Q3 2019. Therefore, the midpoint of guidance assumes itself in line with Q2 with a continued manageable level of -- For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our value portfolio, intruder franchise and specialty pharmaceutical -- And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and preventives. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of 2021, while simultaneously investing to normalized operating expense level in the first half of 2021. remain below what we would expect for our near-term run rate. We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%. We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.437 billion shares for Q3 2021 1.435 billion shares for the full year 2018. We are raising full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.58 to $1.62 and which includes our updated sales guidance and considers Q2 results, which remove additional uncertainty from our previously wider range.

Yes, Bob 
That's on the strong quarter and congrats to Lauren. So first question for Mike and Dan is -- Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your back half 2021 assumptions. You mentioned that you assume a manageable level of COVID. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what that means. Does that mean specifically that you assume things get a little worse from what you're seeing today? Or do you assume things stay about the same? 
I think if you look at the numbers, Bob, and I think a lot of it has to do with the comps, right? If you look at our comps from 2019 quarter-by-quarter, there's $667 million -- And so we put up effectively a 9% in Q2 versus 6% in 2019. If you look at our guidance for Q3, it's 5% to 7%. So to take the midpoint at 6%. That's against the comp of a 6, which is a 9, which is 300 basis points harder -- So in theory, the 6 effectively becomes a 9% when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think what you're hearing us say is that Q2, the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply is that for the most part, continues in the back half. So manageable COVID impact would be a quarter similar to what you saw in Q2. 
SPEAKER06
Okay. So it sounds like you think -- sorry, go ahead, Mike. 
SPEAKER08
No, does that track and make sense for you? 
SPEAKER06
Yes, it sounds like you're assuming that things are basically stay the same. They don't get worse from what you just said, which 
UNKNOWN

SPEAKER06
Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up question is I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about WATCHMAN trends in the quarter. It sounds like things went really well. But just curious if you maybe you could provide a growth rate over 2019 -- Just curious for kind of flushing out the experience with WATCHMAN in the quarter a little bit more. And if you can quantify it at all, that would be helpful. 
UNKNOWN
Yes. Sure. 
SPEAKER09
Yes, I won't be providing a growth rate on '19. But overall, the plans with WATCHMAN FLX have gone exceedingly well. As we mentioned, the U.S. has really been fully converted at this point, which happened ahead of schedule. -- and we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule. But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of Flex, the utilization of WATCHMAN FLX in the U.S. accounts, in particular, continues to increase. So we do have some small new incremental account openings -- But far and away, the bulk of the growth in the U.S. is being driven by increasing physician utilization and penetration rates. And we recently have some approval in Japan. And so you're starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which will get more so in the second half as well as in 2022. But it's really being driven by the utilization rates, the safety profile, physician comfort with the device. -- and training new physicians at existing facilities. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN and new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base, the physician community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. and we continue to expect to do well in it, but it's an exciting platform for us."

Great. And maybe a follow-up for Dan and a suggestion, Dan. I think some of us had a little trouble hearing the Nuance guidance you gave, if you guys want to send out your prepared remarks, I think that would be really helpful for all the investors. But maybe just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned higher input costs in COGS. So improving in second half versus first half, but maybe not all the way quite up to 2019. How are you thinking about the company's ability to absorb and pass on some of those costs? And -- Do you think that's going to be an issue going into 2022 as we exit the year here? Because you did have great expense control down the P&L, just thinking about the cost component 
SPEAKER07
Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Relative to gross margin, so we averaged 69.8% in the first half. And I think we feel comfortable that we'll improve upon that here in the second half of '21. Specific to what's going on in gross margin, we will have the tailwind of the COVID-related variances that we put on the balance sheet during 2020, those are amortized over your inventory turns. And so effectively, as of 6/30 this year, the end of Q2, those are gone. So that's good news. We do still have some COVID-specific lingering costs of running plants in a covert environment. So COVID is not completely done, obviously, as you know. And so we do have those and those are adding costs -- And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us. We do have some pockets of inflation and particularly with freight where we just need more commercial airliners to be in that are flying today. We have wage pressure in certain locations and then direct materials, particularly precious metals and things like that. We're seeing inflation there. So we do have some headwinds. But overall, as we look at the back half of '21, assume we would improve versus that 69.8% average in the first half. And then as it relates to '22 and beyond, I would envision we'll give you a more detailed review of that in Investor Day on the 22nd of September."

No, we expect to -- as we've done in previous years provide an update on our portfolio across the company. give some visibility to the long-range strategy and financial goals, similar to what we've done historically.

But more importantly, hear from the business unit presidents on that portfolio and innovation across the company.

Got it. And just for my follow-up, Mike, on Luminex and Farapulse, why was this the right time to acquire both? What's the outlook for Luminus, -- Is that $200 million, you said for sales in 2021. Is that net after your distribution agreement? 
SPEAKER09
Yes. I have to verify that number. We'll get the I know you said in the numbers in the past in terms of the Luminus net number. So let's circle back on that one. But the timing just strategically, it makes perfect sense. I think that the group is aware of this. We had a distribution agreement with Luminus in the U.S. distribution agreement with them in China, which was effective, but therefore, we weren't getting the same level of gross margin benefit that we wanted. -- nor could we innovate on the platform and I guess, tie it more comprehensively into our StoneSmart platform. So by own met, we obviously improved our gross margins we can drive a more robust product road map within our smart ecosystem, and then we can expand our direct coverage in Europe and especially in China where they have a very big business.

Yes, absolutely, Mike.

And because of the safety, much more straightforward procedure for physicians. So quicker procedure for physicians? And is that again, likely to be at least as effective and probably more effective than other technologies. So given that, we're extremely excited and optimistic about their approach.

Understood, Dan. Just 1 on margins, maybe. When should gross margins get back to pre-pandemic levels or perhaps on operating margins, just given the commentary around freight inflationary pressures, should 22 operating margins be at 2019 levels? 
SPEAKER07
Yes. I mean if you think of the back half of this year, that's what we're calling for, Vijay. So we're calling for an average in the back half of '21 to be at our full year 2019 level, which was, call it, around 6% -- So the goal is to do that in the back half of '21 and set us up for '22 and beyond. Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8% in the first half. It will be improving on that in the second half. So when does that get back to specific 2019 levels? -- we'll -- again, we'll give more details at Investor Day. But if you think at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again over history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago, gross margin was growing very nicely and as a percentage of sales. And we were investing in places like the emerging markets and other areas. So SG&A was in sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sales, but still delivered very solid operating margin progression through that time frame. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward, maybe gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bill, so to speak. But SG&A potentially with lower travel spend than other trade-offs that we'll make in addition to more

And then in the second half of '21, you'll see an enhancement in a next release or next-generation release, if you will, of EXALT-D to further improve the platform. So we expect to see continued momentum with that. The big news for us is the recent approval of EXALT-D and some sites that tried it for the first time in Europe, and we're really bullish on that platform. That's an established market with a few competitors, but we think we have some differentiated capabilities with EXALT-D. And so in the second half of '21 and much more so in '22, you'll see the impact of that platform as well. So it's all going to plan, but we're also -- we're seeing some improved momentum with EXALT-D in the U.S. as COVID is improving."

In CRM, we think we're a little bit below market with the exception of those 2, we think every other 1 grew faster than market. On EP, I think you'll see a similar trend likely for the next couple of years. in that we expect the -- our EP results in the international markets to exceed market growth, which we think they did in the second quarter on the heels of our cryo platform, were with us now the only competitor to the established player in cryo and we're taking share there. And then our stable point, which is our 4 set of catheters approved in Europe. And as a previous question, we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter and they're commercial in Europe. 
So the 3 distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform with Farapulse upon closure, our cryo and StablePoint in Europe. And we also expect to see a benefit of cryo in Japan towards the end of '21 and full year '22. So our international business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business and EP will grow faster than market. And our U.S. business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products are in clinical trial right now. And thankfully, as COVID has approved, the clinical trial run rates of those platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP. Really strong outside the U.S., less so in the U.S. likely for the coming earnings calls. 
In CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in the second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to lag a bit in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead that is being implanted now across -- in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter SICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM."

I'm pleased to report very strong Q2 financial results as the resumption of elective procedures strengthened in the U.S. and improved in many, but certainly not all our regions across the globe. We' are well positioned for the second half of 2021 and beyond as we continue to execute our category leadership strategy, driven by our innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities. 
Total company's second quarter operational sales grew 50% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 52% versus 2020 and 9% versus '19, exceeding expectations as recovery from the pandemic occurred more quickly than expected, particularly in the U.S. 
Importantly, 6 of the 7 business units grew double-digit organically versus 2019. We estimate that 5 of our business units grew faster than their respective markets. We are pleased with our ongoing and new product launches, and we are now enrolling our clinical trials our clinical trials pre-COVID run rates. 
Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.40 grew to 378% versus 2020, and 3% versus 2019, exceeding the high end of the guidance by $0.02, primarily due to sales outperformance and lower spend. 
Adjusted operating margin of 25.1% was slightly ahead of our expectations as we continue to balance investment with the sales recovery. We continue to be pleased with our free cash flow. Second quarter free cash flow generation of $541 million and adjusted free cash flow of $838 million. 
Given the second quarter outperformance, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which assumes a manageable level of COVID impact in the second half of the year. 
Compared to 2020, we're targeting in the third quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and full year, 19% to 20%. Compared to '19, we're targeting third quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% and for the full year growth of 6% to 7%. 
Our third quarter '21 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.39 to $0.41 and we are updating our full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.58 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance and outlook, including the revenue contribution from Preventice. 
We continue to expect a third quarter close for Farapulse and the second half '21 close of Lumenis Surgical. I'll now provide additional highlights of second quarter '21 results, along with comments on third quarter and '21 outlook. 
Within the regions, on an operational basis versus second quarter '19, the U.S. grew 22%; Europe/Middle/Africa grew 9%; Asia Pac grew 4%; and Emerging markets sales grew 11%. 
Organically, in the U.S., the U.S. grew 12% versus 2019. The strength was supported by faster anticipated recovery of procedure volume levels, along with ongoing new launches across the portfolio.
Operationally, EMEA delivered an excellent second quarter with broad-based growth across all major markets and franchises, even as some countries experience COVID-related lockdowns and procedural delays. 
The EMEA region also had double-digit growth in PI, IP -- sorry, PI, EP, Endo and Neuromod driven by products as ACURATE Neo2, TheraSphere, POLARx, Axios and WaveWriter Alpha,with notable strength in Middle East and Africa. 
In Asia Pac, although second quarter results included approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from China tender pricing versus 2019, 5 of our businesses grew double digits with strong growth in China, Australia and Korea. While Japan's second quarter results were impacted by COVID, we are seeing success with ongoing and new product launches such as Range DCB, Stablepoint, and WATCHMAN FLX. 
China sales grew 16% versus 2019, with strong double-digit growth within all business units with the exception of Interventional Cardiology, which included the negative impact of the tender pricing. 
We continue to be pleased with our strong growth in complex PCI and imaging, enable by both innovative portfolio and by the tender win. 
We continue to expect full year 2021 double-digit growth in China versus both '19 and '20, and I'll provide some comments on the business units. 
Starting with Uro and Pelvic Health, sales were very strong, 16% versus 2019, with balanced growth across our Stone, Prostate Health and Pelvic Health franchises. Stone, which is the largest franchise within double digits as enthusiasm continues ahead of the Lumenis acquisition, which will expand our category-leading Urology portfolio with this differentiated laser technology. 
The Prostate health Franchise grew strong double digits, with continue strength in our Rezum and SpaceOAR businesses Rezum is driven by further traction of its direct to patient efforts in the U.S., global expansion, appreciation for the long term durability and cost benefits of this minimally invasive therapy. 
Within our SpaceOAR business, growth was supported by the ongoing launch of our next generation SPaceOAR Vue hydrogel in the U.S. and our recent la in Europe. 
SpaceOAR Vue is visible under CT and now negates the need for physicians to use MRI ACURATE neo2 important step to optimizing treatment planning for patients undergoing prostrate radiation therapy. 
Our endoscopy team delivered excellent in the second quarter with sales growing organically 15% versus 2019. Q2 sales grew double digits across all major franchises with notable strength in Biliary, Hemostatis and Infection Prevention, thanks to our portfolio including key products such as Axios, SpyGlass and Resolution hemostasis clips. 
Within the quarter, we completed CE Mark for Exalt B, and we're pleased with the early launch feedback highlighting differentiated visualization and suction. We remain on track to launch in the U.S. in the second half of this year.
 
We continue to make progress with Exalt D, with a physician peer training program launched in the second quarter as well as the resumption of more normal market activities as access to hospital improves.
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were down 6% organically versus '19. We believe that our CRM performance was slightly below the overall market, inclusive of a temporary impact of the recent EMBLEM S-ICD physician advisories. 
Importantly, we recently began launching our enhanced S-ICD electrode, anticipated improved performance in overall CRM in the second half, as we expect S-ICD revenues to rebound. 
In our diagnostic franchise, our Lux-Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to perform very well and gain share in the U.S. We're also pleased with the strong growth and execution of the Preventice team to anticipate full year growth in that business at least 20% on a pro forma basis versus '20. 
Electrophysiology sales were up 10% versus '19. Strong international sales growth of 29% were driven by the ongoing success of POLARx in Europe, Stablepoint Force-Sensing catheter in Europe and Japan. 
U.S. EPS sales will likely lag market growth until we receive approval for these therapies, which are currently enrolling in the respective U.S. IDE trials. 
We also exercised our our option to acquire Farapulse, a leader in pulsed field ablation, which is an emerging deal that has the potential to improve safety, efficacy and ease of use for cardiac ablation procedures. 
Farapulse is the only company with approved product in Europe. It's actively enrolling in its U.S. IDE ADVENT trial. We are excited to bring this differentiated therapy into our EP portfolio in third quarter '21. 
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 14% versus '19. Our Pain Management franchise accelerated growth in the second quarter supported an ongoing launch of our next-gen WaveWriter Alpha SCS system with Cognita digital solutions and continued clinical clinical evidence generation. 
At the NANS mid-year meeting, we released 1 year follow-up data for the COMBO study, demonstrating on a sustained, high level of clinical and functional success at 84% response rate. 
We also started reporting on the real-world results of the FAST therapy, which is designed to provide profound and immediate pain relief. 
Beyond advancing outcomes For our existing indications, we are also pleased with the progress of our SOLIS Study, which is focused on non-surgical Back population. We started in Q1 of this year and look forward to beginning our diabetic peripheral Neuropathy clinical study by the end of this year. 
In Deep Brain stimulation, the business continues to gain share globally and deliver strong double-digit growth, driven by the launch of the Vercise Genus platform, the expansion of our commercial infrastructure and partnership with Brainlab. 
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 10% versus 2019 with double-digit growth in Structural Heart Valves, WATCHMAN and Complex PCI and Imaging franchises. 
The growth of WATCHMAN franchise accelerated sequentially The impressive growth was driven by primarily by increasing hospital and continue physician utilization rates in the U.S., some share gains in Europe. 
Importantly, nearly all U.S. accounts transitioned from WATCHMAN 2.5 that are now using the FLX exclusive. 
Additionally, we're pleased with the 2-year results of PINNACLE FLX, which features a late-breaker at TVT, which reinforced our positive 1-year primary outcomes and met its secondary effectiveness endpoint.
We remain excited about the outlook for the WATCHMAN franchise, our next-generation FLX device, global expansion continued to work toward indication expansion through ongoing clinical trials. Notably the OPTION trial, comparing WATCHMAN FLX to first-line oral anticoagulants for patients with nonvalvular afib who also undergo cardiac ablation procedure. Recently, we completed the enrollment out of schedule despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. 
In TAVR, our 5 ACURATE Neo2 launch continues to do well in Europe, supported by real-world data presented at Euro PCR, which demonstrated that the low ACURATE neo2 PVL rate is comparable to temporary TAVI devices, with continued low permanent pacemaker implantation rates. These outcomes were reiterated in Early Neo2 Registry, also presented last week at TVT as a late-breaker.
Sentinel, our cerebral embolic protection device, achieved its highest quarterly sales to date with a new account openings globally. We continue to enroll in the PROTECTED TAVR randomized clinical trial. 
Coronary Therapies declined mid-single digits versus '19 attributable to Drug-Eluting Stents, which included the impact of the China tenders and global price pressure. We continue to see strong growth in COMPLEX PCI and Imaging, ] with particular strength in RotaPRO and IVUS. 
In our global complex PCI and Imaging business is now 50% larger than our DES business. We're advancing opportunities for future growth drivers within the quarter began enrollment in our AGENT DCB trial, which is the first in the U.S. study of coronary in-stent restenosis. 
Peripheral Interventions delivered organic sales up 10% versus second quarter '19 with Interventional Oncology, TheraSphere grew by 30% versus 2019 on a pro forma basis in its first full quarter post PMA approval. 
Venous, Varithena continues to grow double digits and gain share in the varicose vein market. 
Within arterial, our Drug-eluting portfolio achieved record sales in the second quarter, supported by global expansion along with the sector's continuing recovery. We just started enrollment on the Elegance registry study that will gather clinical evidence on the risk of PAD, previously underrepresented patient populations. The study will also look at long-term outcomes of patients being treated with Eluvia DES or Ranger DCB. 
I'd also like to highlight Boston Scientific's recent inclusion on the JUST Capital Top 100 listed companies, which supports healthy families and communities, along with our recognition of the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion. We're proud to be recognized by our employees ACURATE neo2 inclusive and supportive environment and remain committed to global sustainable practices.

On an operational basis, revenue growth was 49.6% in the quarter. 
Sales from the Preventice acquisition contributed 240 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting in 52.4% organic revenue growth above our guidance range of 44% to 48% growth versus 2020. 
Compared to the second quarter 2019, organic growth was 8.9% above our guidance range of 3% to 6%. This 8.9% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of the divested intrauterine health and embolic beads business as well $178 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of 2 months of Vertiflex and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicine and Preventice. 
Top line results drove Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, representing 378% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019 and exceeding our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70,5%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales outperformance in higher-margin business. 
As expected, we have materially worked through the COVID-driven negative manufacturing capital balance sheet in 2020 and as a result, expect slight improvements in second half gross margin compared to the first half, still not at full year 2019 level as other headwinds remained, in particular, the lingering cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures as well as some impact from inflation. Not unique to us, this inflation items like increased freight costs, selective wage pressure and some price increase on direct materials. 
Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.1%, slightly above our expectations driven by sales outperformance and balanced investment. Also includes a reserve for legal settlement that we expect will improve access to additional markets for some of our cardiovascular technology.
GAAP charges within the quarter additionally included $298 million in litigation-related expenses to account for incremental costs to resolve newly estimable claims, as well as known claims and corresponding legal fees within our legal reserve. 
Materially, all U.S. claims remain settled or at the final stages of settlement. Our reserves assumptions based on full global resolution now in 2023 given recent claim activity and expected litigation. 
Our total legal reserve of $617 million as of June 30, an increase $162 million versus March 31, driven by the mesh reserve increase in cardiovascular settlement, partially offset by payments to close substantially all of the State attorneys general mesh settlement as well as continuing mesh products liability payments. 
Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $107 million, in line with expectations. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 11.1% on an adjusted basis, also in line with expectations. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $838 million, and free cash flow was $541 million. $643 million from operating activities, less $102 million of net capital expenditures. All remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020 of approximately $2 billion. We continue to project in the reporting capital patents and inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of the year. 
As of June 30, 2020, we had cash on hand of $2.7 billion. Top priority for capital deployment main tuck-in M&A. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Surgical second half of the year and Farapulse in Q3. We have capacity to pursue [indiscernible] business development opportunities while continuing to remain active with our venture capital and consider opportunistic share repurchases. 
We ended Q2 with 1,432 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2020. In the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50 basis point headwind from divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of [indiscernible]. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect to manage revenue growth [indiscernible] 20% versus 2020 [indiscernible] versus 6% to 7% versus 2019. 
organic comparison to 2019 full year 2019 sales million [indiscernible] sales of our evolving portfolio in intrefranchises as well as $1 million in specialty pharmaceutical sales. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales excluded approximately $409 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex, May rental medicines through mid-August and provided as remarks as well as $13 million of specialty pharmaceutic sales prior to divestiture. 
Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range 7% to 13% versus 2020, includes an approximately 100 basis point headwind from Speciality Pharmaceutical, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice.
Excluding the impact acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 19% to 20% versus 2020; and 6% to 7% on growth versus 2019. For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales excludes $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales and at the midpoint of guidance 2021 sales exclude approximately $490 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August, and Preventice as of March, as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.
For Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% vs. 2020, which includes an approximate net 100 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% vs. 2020, and 5% to 7% growth vs. 2019, which includes a 300 basis point sequential comp headwind from Q2 to Q3 2019. Therefore, the midpoint of guidance assumes results in line with Q2 with a continued manageable level of COVID impact.
For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio, intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals; and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice
For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of 2021, while simultaneously investing to normalize operating expense level in the first half of 2021, remained below what we would expect for our near-term run rate. 
We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%. We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.437 billion shares for Q3 2021 to 1.435 billion shares for the full year 2020. 
We are raising full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.58 to $1.62, which includes our updated sales guidance and considers Q2 results, which we move additional uncertainty from our previously wider range. 
For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.41. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 '21 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q2 results. 
I'll turn it back to our newly appointed Vice President of Investor Relations. Congratulations, Lauren, very well deserved, to moderate."

So in theory, the 6 effectively becomes a 9 when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think what you're hearing us say is that Q2 that the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply is that for the most part, continues in the back half. So manageable COVID impact would be a quarter similar to what you saw in Q2."

But overall, the plans with WATCHMAN FLX have gone exceedingly well. As we mentioned, the U.S. has really been fully converted at this point, which happened ahead of schedule and we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule. But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of FLX, the utilization of WATCHMAN FLX in the U.S. accounts, in particular, continues to increase. So we do have some small new incremental account openings. But far and away, the bulk of the growth in the U.S. is being driven by increasing physician utilization and penetration rates. And we recently have some approval in Japan. And so you're starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which will get more so in the second half as well as in 2022. 
But it's really being driven by the utilization rates, safety profile, physician comfort with the device and training new physicians at existing facilities. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN and new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base, the physician community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. and we continue to expect to do well in it, but it's an exciting platform for us."

And in the -- if you break down, if you look at Neuro and Endo, particularly also PI, where we have a more substantial ASC business and outpatient business, you saw 15% -- 16% growth in neuro, 15% in endo and 10% organic in PI with strong growth compares here. So I would say in the U.S., we saw a nice rebound, both in the hospital setting, which I think has been verified by many of the public company hospital change reporting prior to us, and we saw strong growth in the outpatient ASC center as well."

And so effectively, as of 6/30 this year, the end of Q2, those are gone. So that's good news. We do still have some COVID-specific lingering costs of running plants in a COVID environment. So COVID is not completely done, obviously, as you know. And so we do have those and those are adding costs. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us. We do have some pockets of inflation and particularly with freight where we just need more commercial airliners to be in that are flying today. We have wage pressure in certain locations and then direct materials, particularly precious metals and things like that. We're seeing inflation there. So we do have some headwinds.

I mean if you think of the back half of this year, that's what we're calling for, Vijay. So we're calling for an average in the back half of '21 to be at our full year 2019 level, which was, call it, around 26%. So the goal is to do that in the back half of '21 and set us up for '22 and beyond. Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8% in the first half. It will be improving on that in the second half. So when does that get back to specific 2019 levels? We'll, again, we'll give more details at Investor Day. But if you think at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again over history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago, gross margin was growing very nicely and as a percentage of sales. And we were investing in places like the emerging markets and other areas. So SG&A was in sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sales, but still delivered very solid operating margin progression through that time frame. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward, maybe gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bill, so to speak. But SG&A potentially with lower travel spend and other trade-offs that we'll make in addition to more R&D spend. The goal is always to have operating margins increase year-over-year, and I think our track record speaks for itself on that."

And I think part of it is a combination of the unique portfolio that we have with the new launches, the new fast algorithms and I detailed in the script, that may have had a difficult adherence. We're going to send it out to people. But a combination of the new fast algorithms as well as the clinical work that we're doing. So SCS overall improved versus first quarter. And then it was augmented, as you mentioned, with Vertiflex's growth in the quarter as well as continued growth in our RF portfolio. The RF portfolio, although a bit smaller, continues to exceed expectations. 
And then the other really big growth driver for neuromod in the quarter was our deep brain stimulation business. And it's really impressive what that group has done. They continue to gain market share, really the #1 de novo player in Europe and close to that now in the U.S., and they continue to accelerate market share gains through the innovation of that business. 
So the DBS probably had the largest snapback of any business in the second quarter, with the COVID impact in the U.S. But overall, the SCS market and the pain side did quite well as well. But we'll see the other competitors report, but we're impressed with the sequential growth that we saw."

And then in the second half of '21, you'll see an enhancement in a next release or next-generation release, if you will, of EXALT-D to further improve the platform. So we expect to see continued momentum with that. The big news for us is the recent approval of EXALT-D and some sites that tried it for the first time in Europe, and we're really bullish on that platform. That's an established market with a few competitors, but we think we have some differentiated capabilities with EXALT-D.

And then our stable point, which is our 4 set of catheters approved in Europe. And as a previous question, we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter and they're commercial in Europe. 
So the 3 distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform with Farapulse upon closure, our cryo and StablePoint in Europe. And we also expect to see a benefit of cryo in Japan towards the end of '21 and full year '22. So our international business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business and EP will grow faster than market. And our U.S. business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products are in clinical trial right now. And thankfully, as COVID has approved, the clinical trial run rates of those platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP. Really strong outside the U.S., less so in the U.S. likely for the coming earnings calls. 
In CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in the second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to lag a bit in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead that is being implanted now across -- in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter S-ICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone on the call that operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, which closed March 1, 2021; and Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Specialty Pharma due to close -- which closed on March 1, 2021; and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine [ health ] franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and second quarter 2020, respectively. 
Guidance excludes the recently announced Lumenis Surgical acquisition, which is expected to close in the second half of 2021; and Farapulse acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3 2021, which are subject to customary closing conditions, including antitrust clearance. For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations [ website ].

I'm pleased to report very strong Q2 financial results as the resumption of elective procedures strengthened in the U.S. and improved in many but not all of our regions across the globe. We're well positioned for the second half of '21 and beyond as we continue to execute our category leadership strategy driven by our innovative pipeline, expansion into faster-growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities.  
Total company second quarter operational sales grew 50% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 52% versus 2020 and 9% versus '19, exceeding our expectations as recovery from the pandemic occurred more quickly than expected, particularly in the U.S. Importantly, 6 of the 7 business units grew double digits organically versus 2019. We estimate that 5 of our business units grew faster than their respective  markets. We're pleased with our ongoing and new product launches, and we're now enrolling our clinical trials at pre-COVID run rates.  
Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.40 grew 378% versus 2020, 3% versus '19, exceeding the high end of the guidance by $0.02 primarily due to sales outperformance and lower spend. Adjusted operating margin of 25.1% was slightly ahead of our expectations as we continue to balance investment with sales recovery. We continue to be pleased with our free cash flow, with second quarter free cash flow generation of $541 million and adjusted free cash flow of [ $838 million ].  
Given the second quarter outperformance, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which assumes a manageable level of COVID impact in the second half of the year. Compared to 2020, we're targeting in the third quarter of '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 14%; and full year, 19% to 20%. And compared to '19, we're targeting a third quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%; and for the full year, growth of  6% to 7%. 
Our third quarter '21 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.39 to $0.41, and we are updating our full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.58 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance, including the revenue contribution from Preventice. We continue to expect a third quarter close for Farapulse and a second half '21 close for Lumenis Surgical. 
I'll now provide additional highlights for the second quarter '21 results, along with comments on third quarter and '21 outlook. Within the regions, on an operational basis versus second quarter '19, the U.S. grew 22%; Europe, Middle East and Africa  grew 9%; Asia Pac grew 4%; and Emerging Markets sales grew 11%. 
Organically, in the U.S. -- the U.S. grew 12% versus 2019. The strength was supported by faster-than-anticipated recovery of procedure volume  levels, along with ongoing new [ product ] launches. 
Operationally, EMEA delivered an excellent second quarter with broad-based growth across nearly all major markets and franchises, even as some countries experienced COVID-related lockdowns and procedural delays. The EMEA region also had double-digit growth in PI, IP -- sorry, PI, EP, endo and neuromod [ driven ] by products such as ACURATE neo2, TheraSphere, POLARx, AXIOS and WaveWriter Alpha, with notable strength in Middle East and Africa.  
In Asia Pac, although second quarter results included approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from the China tender pricing versus 2019, 5 of our businesses grew double digits with strong growth in China, Australia and Korea. While Japan's second quarter results were impacted by COVID, we've seen success with ongoing and new product launches such as Ranger DCB, StablePoint and WATCHMAN FLX.  
China sales grew 16% versus 2019. We saw double-digit growth within all business units with the exception of Interventional Cardiology, which did include the negative impact of the tender pricing. We continue to be pleased with our strong growth in Complex PCI and imaging, enabled by our both innovative portfolio and by the tender win. We continue to expect full year 2021 double-digit growth in China versus both '19 and '20. 
Now I'll provide some comments on the business units. Starting with Uro and Pelvic Health. Sales were very strong, growing organically 16% versus '19 with balanced growth across the stone, prostate health and pelvic health franchises. Stone, which is the largest franchise, grew double digits as enthusiasm continues ahead of the Lumenis acquisition, which will expand our category-leading portfolio with its differentiated laser technology. 
The prostate health franchise grew strong double digits with continued growth in Rezum and SpaceOAR businesses. Rezum [ growth ] was driven by further traction of its direct-to-patient efforts in the U.S., global expansion and [ continued ] appreciation of the long-term durability and cost benefits of this minimally invasive therapy. Within our SpaceOAR business, growth was supported by the ongoing launch of our next-generation SpaceOAR Vue  Hydrogel in the U.S. and our recent launch in Europe. SpaceOAR Vue is visible under CT and negates the need for physicians to use MRI. It's an important step to optimize the treatment plan of patients undergoing prostate radiation therapy. 
Our Endoscopy team delivered an excellent second quarter with sales growing organically 15% versus 2019. Q2 sales grew double digits across all major franchises with notable strength in biliary, hemostasis and infection prevention, thanks to our [ differentiated product ] portfolio, including key products such as AXIOS, SpyGlass [ DS ] and Resolution hemostasis clips. Within the quarter, we completed CE mark for Exalt B, and we're pleased with the early launch feedback highlighting differentiated visualization and suction and remain on track to launch in the U.S. in the second half of this year. We continue to make progress with Exalt-D, with physician peer training program launched in the second quarter as well as the resumption of more normal market development activities as access to hospitals improves. 
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were down 6% organically versus '19. We believe that our CRM performance was slightly below the overall market, inclusive of a temporary impact from the recent EMBLEM S-ICD  physician advisory. Importantly, we recently began launching our enhanced S-ICD electrode and anticipate improved performance in overall CRM in the second half as we expect S-ICD revenues to rebound. 
In our diagnostics franchise, our Lux-Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to perform very well and gained share in the U.S. We're also pleased with the strong growth and execution of the Preventice team and continue to anticipate full year [ growth ] in that business of at least 20% on a pro forma basis versus '20. 
Electrophysiology sales were up 10% versus '19. Strong international sales growth of 29% were driven by the ongoing success of POLARx in Europe and StablePoint Force Sensing catheter in Europe and Japan. U.S. EP sales will likely lag market growth until we receive approval for these therapies, which are currently enrolling in their  respective U.S. IDE trials. 
We also exercised our option to acquire Farapulse, which is a leader in [ pulsed field ] ablation, which is an emerging field that has the potential to improve safety, efficacy and ease of use for cardiac ablation procedures. Farapulse is the only company with a commercially approved [ pulse ablation ] product in Europe. It's actively enrolling in its U.S. IDE ADVENT trial. We're excited to bring this differentiated therapy into our EP portfolio in [ quarter 3 ] '21. 
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 14% versus '19. Our pain management franchise accelerated growth in the second quarter, supported by an ongoing launch of our next-gen WaveWriter Alpha SCS system, Cognita digital solutions and continued clinical evidence generation. At the NANS midyear meeting, we released 1 year follow-up data for the COMBO study, demonstrating a sustained high level of clinical and functional success at 84% responder rate. We also started reporting on the real-world results of the FAST therapy, which is designed to improve -- provide profound and immediate pain relief. 
Beyond advancing outcomes for existing indications, we're pleased with the progress of our SOLIS study, which is focused on a nonsurgical back population, which started in the first quarter of this year, and [ look forward ] to beginning our diabetic and peripheral neuropathy [ clinical ] study by the end of the year. In deep brain stimulation, the business continues to gain share globally and deliver strong double-digit growth, driven by the launch of the  Vercise Genus platform, expansion of our commercial infrastructure and partnership with [ Brainlab ]. 
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 10% versus 2019, double-digit growth in Structural Heart Valves, WATCHMAN and Complex PCI and [ imaging franchises ]. The growth of the WATCHMAN franchise accelerated sequentially. The impressive growth was driven primarily by increasing hospital and physician utilization rates in the U.S. and some share gains in Europe. [ Importantly ], nearly all U.S. accounts have transitioned from WATCHMAN 2.5 and are now using the FLX exclusively. 
Additionally, we're pleased with the 2-year results of PINNACLE FLX, which was featured as a late breaker at TVT, which reinforced our positive 1-year primary outcomes and met its secondary effectiveness endpoint. We remain excited about the outlook for the WATCHMAN franchise with our next-generation FLX device, global expansion and continued work toward indication expansion through ongoing clinical trials. Notably, the OPTION trial comparing WATCHMAN FLX to first-line oral anti-coagulants for patients with non-valvular AFib who also undergo cardiac ablation procedure recently completed enrollment ahead of schedule, in spite of challenges presented by the pandemic. 
In TAVR, our ACURATE neo2 launch continues to do well in Europe, supported [ in part ] by real-world data presented at EuroPCR, which demonstrate that the low ACURATE neo2 PVL rate is comparable to contemporary TAVI devices, with continued low permanent pacemaker [ implantation rates]. These outcomes were reiterated in the Early neo2 Registry, also presented last week at TVT as a late-breaker. Sentinel, our cerebral embolic protection device, achieved its highest quarterly sales to date with strong new account openings globally. We continue to enroll in the Protected TAVR randomized clinical trial. 
Coronary therapies declined mid-single digits versus '19, attributable to drug-eluting stents, which included the impact of the China tenders and global price pressure. We continue to see strong growth in Complex PCI and [ imaging, with particular ] strength in ROTAPRO and IVUS. [ Importantly ], our global Complex PCI and imaging business is now [ about ] 50% larger than our DES business. We're advancing opportunities for future growth drivers and within the quarter began enrollment in our AGENT DCB trial, which is a first in the U.S. study of coronary in-stent restenosis. 
Peripheral Interventions delivered organic sales up 10% versus second quarter '19. Within interventional oncology, TheraSphere grew by 30% versus 2019 on a pro forma basis in its first full quarter post PMA approval. In venous, Varithena continues to grow double digits and gain share in the varicose vein market. Within arterial, our drug-eluting portfolio achieved record sales in the second quarter, supported by global expansion along with the sector's continuing [ recovery ]. We're pleased to have started enrollment on the Elegance registry, a study that will gather clinical evidence on the risk of PAD in [ previously ] underrepresented patient populations. The study will also look at long-term outcomes of patients being treated with Eluvia DES or Ranger DCB.  
I'd also like to highlight Boston Scientific's recent inclusion on the JUST Capital Top 100 list of companies which supports healthy families and communities, along with our recognition as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion. We're proud to be recognized for providing our employees an inclusive and supportive environment and remain committed to global sustainable practices. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and we remain bullish on the long-range outlook for Boston Scientific. We look forward to sharing our strategic plan objectives at our hybrid Investor Day event on September 22. I'd like to extend a big thank you to our employees for their contributions and winning spirit. 
I'll turn the call over to Dan."
317627,1672382391,2351864,"Boston Scientific Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Boston Scientific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.077 billion represents 53.6% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2020 [ and reflects ] an $81 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 49.6",1175,"Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.077 billion represents 53.6% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2020 [ and reflects ] an $81 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 49.6% in the quarter. Sales from the Preventice acquisition [ contributed ] 240 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting in 52.4% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of [ 44% to 48% ] growth versus 2020. 
Compared to the second quarter 2019, organic growth was 8.9%, above our guidance range of 3% to 6%. This 8.9% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of the divested [ intrauterine ] health and embolic beads business as well as $178 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of 2 months of Vertiflex and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicine and Preventice. Top line results drove Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, representing 378% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019 and exceeding our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38. 
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.5%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales outperformance in higher-margin business. As expected, we have materially worked through the COVID-driven negative manufacturing variances capitalized in our balance sheet in 2020 and as a result, expect slight improvements in second half gross margin compared to the first half, though still not at full year 2019 level as other headwinds remained, in particular the lingering cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures as well as some impact from inflation. Not unique to us, this inflation [ includes ] items like increased freight costs, selective wage pressure and some price increase on direct materials. 
Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.1%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales outperformance and balanced investment and also includes a reserve for legal settlement that we expect will improve access to additional markets for some of our cardiovascular technology. GAAP charges within the quarter additionally included $298 million in litigation-related expenses to account for incremental costs to resolve newly estimable claims as well as known claims and corresponding legal fees within our legal reserve. Materially, all U.S. claims remain settled or at the final stages of settlement. 
Our reserves assumptions are based on full global resolution now in 2023 given recent claim activity and expected litigation. Our total legal reserve was $617 million as of June 30, an increase $162 million versus March 31, driven by the mesh reserve increase and cardiovascular settlement, partially offset by payments to close substantially all of the state attorneys general mesh settlement as well as continuing mesh product liability payments. 
Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $107 million, in line with expectations. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 11.1% on an adjusted basis, also in line with expectations. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $838 million, and free cash flow was $541 million, with $643 million from operating activities less $102 million of net capital expenditures. Our goal remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020 of approximately $2 billion as we continue to expect increased working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of the year. 
As of June 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of $2.7 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&A, We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Lumenis Surgical i the second half of the year and Farapulse in Q3. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities while continuing to remain active with our venture capital [ portfolio ] and consider opportunistic share repurchases. We ended Q2 with 1,432 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2020. In the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50 basis point headwind from divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of [ Preventice ]. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect to organic revenue growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% versus 2020 and versus 6% to 7% versus 2019. 
For organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales million exclude [ $50 million ] in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $490 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice as of March as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture. 
For Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range 11% to 13% versus 2020, which includes an approximately net 100 basis point headwind from Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% versus 2020 and 5% to 7% growth versus 2019, which includes a 300 basis point sequential comp headwind from Q2 to Q3 2019. Therefore, the midpoint of guidance assumes results in line with Q2 with a continued manageable level of [ COVID impact ].
For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio, intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice.
For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of 2021 while simultaneously investing to more normalized operating expense level as the first half of 2021 remained below what we would expect for near-term run rate. We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%. We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program, to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. 
We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1, 437 billion shares for Q3 2021 to 1,435 billion shares for the full year 2021. We are raising full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.58 to $1.62, which includes our updated sales guidance and considers Q2 results, which remove additional uncertainty from our previously wider range. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.41. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 '21 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q2 results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to our newly appointed Vice President of Investor Relations, congratulations, Lauren, very well deserved, to moderate [ Q&A ]."

That's against the comp of a 6%, which is -- of a 9%, which is 300 basis points harder. 
So in theory, the 6% effectively becomes a 9% when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think what you're hearing us say is that -- Q2, that the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply is that for the most part, it continues in the back half.

As we mentioned, the U.S. has really been fully converted at this point, which happened ahead of schedule. And we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule. 
But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of FLX, the utilization of WATCHMAN FLX in the U.S. accounts in particular continues to increase. So we do have some small new incremental account openings. But far and away, the bulk of the growth in the U.S. is being driven by increasing physician utilization and penetration rates. And we recently have some approval in Japan. And so we're starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which will get more so in the second half as well as in 2022. 
But it's really being driven by, the utilization rate, the safety profile, physician comfort with the device and training new physicians at existing facilities. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN, and new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base, the physician community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. And we continue to expect to do well in it, but it's an exciting platform for us."

We do still have some COVID-specific lingering costs of running plants in a COVID environment. So COVID is not completely done, obviously, as you know. And so we do have those, and those are adding costs. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us, we do have some pockets of inflation, and -- particularly with freight, where we just need more commercial airliners to be flying than are flying today. We have wage pressure in certain locations. And then direct materials, particularly precious metals and things like that, we're seeing inflation there. 
So we do have some headwinds. But overall, as we look at the back half of '21, we would assume we would improve versus that 69.8% average in the first half. And then as it relates to '22 and beyond, I would envision we'll give you a more detailed review of that in Investor Day on the 22nd of September."

We had a distribution agreement with Lumenis in the U.S., distribution agreement with them in China, which was effective, but therefore, we weren't getting the same level of gross margin benefit that we wanted nor could we innovate on the platform and I guess, tie it more comprehensively into our StoneSmart platform. 
So by owning it, we obviously improve our gross margins. We can drive a more robust product road map within our StoneSmart ecosystem, and then we can expand our direct coverage in Europe and especially in China, where they have a very big business. So that makes sense.

What Farapulse has demonstrated in a wealth of clinical data to date, over 100 patients in clinical trials that have been reported out publicly, is a very high expectation that this is going to be safer than other thermal approaches to ablation and because of the safety, a much more straightforward procedure for physicians. So quicker procedure for physicians and is, again, likely to be at least as effective and probably more effective than other technologies. 
So given that, we're extremely excited and optimistic about their approach. And as Mike said, given that they are the only approved technology in Europe, given that they're executing so well on their clinical trials, by exercising the option now and again, hopefully closing in the near future, we have the opportunity now to help them scale up distribution and production and again, the ability to help them continue to execute their clinical trials and get to U.S. approval in a timely fashion."

Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8% in the first half. It will be improving on that in the second half. So when does that get back to specific 2019 levels? We'll -- again, we'll give more details at Investor Day. But if you think at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again over history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago, gross margin was growing very nicely and -- as a percentage of sales, and we were investing in places like the emerging markets and other areas. 
So SG&A was sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sales, but still delivered very solid operating margin progression through that time frame. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward. Maybe gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bill, so to speak. But SG&A, potentially with lower travel spend and other trade-offs that we'll make in addition to more efficient R&D spend, the goal is always to have operating margins increase year-over-year, and I think our track record speaks for itself on that."

So SCS overall improved versus first quarter. And then it was augmented, as you've mentioned, with Vertiflex's growth in the quarter as well as continued growth in our RF portfolio. The RF portfolio, although a bit smaller, continues to exceed expectations. 
And then the other really big growth driver for neuromod in the quarter was our deep brain stimulation business, and it's really impressive what that group has done. They continue to gain market share, really the #1 de novo player in Europe and close to that now in the U.S. And they continue to accelerate market share gains through the innovation of that business.

With the exception of those 2, we think every other one grew faster than market. 
On EP, I think you'll see a similar trend likely for the next couple of years in that we expect the -- our EP results in the international markets to exceed market growth, which we think they did in the second quarter on the heels of our cryo platform. We're now the only competitor to the established player in cryo, and we're taking share there. And then our StablePoint, which is our Force Sensing catheters approved in Europe. And as previous question, we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter, and they're commercial in Europe. So the 3 distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform with Farapulse upon closure, our cryo and StablePoint in Europe. 
And we also expect to see a benefit of cryo in Japan towards the end of '21 and full year '22. So our international business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business in EP, will grow faster than market. And our U.S. business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products are in clinical trial right now, and thankfully, as COVID has improved, the clinical trial run rates of those platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP: really strong outside the U.S., less so in the U.S. likely for the coming earnings calls. 
In CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in the second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to lag a bit in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead that is being implanted now across -- in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter S-ICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM."

And then if you give me a third one, there's lots of different areas to speak to. I think -- yes. I think just overall in the -- I know it's super early, but we're very bullish on the combination of cryo and Farapulse, although not in the U.S. yet.

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. 
The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q3 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q4 full year 2021 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q4 and 2021 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Dr. Ken Stein. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less in a period of -- a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Spec Pharma, which closed on March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. 
Guidance excludes the recently announced Avoro Medical and Baylis Medical acquisitions, which are expected to close in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22, respectively. For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. 
On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8% ex-COVID represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'd note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. 
Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC.

I'm proud of our global team's execution despite the various challenges presented by the COVID surge in third quarter. The third quarter was impacted by COVID more than we anticipated as the D",1946,"Thanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm proud of our global team's execution despite the various challenges presented by the COVID surge in third quarter. The third quarter was impacted by COVID more than we anticipated as the Delta variant surged globally and some electric procedures were deferred. 
While we aren't satisfied with this quarter's sales results, we delivered on our third quarter EPS and margin targets. And we're confident that as global vaccination rates continue to increase and COVID wanes, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term sales goals. 
We continue to be excited and confident about the opportunities we laid out at our recent Investor Day, further enabled by our strategy of category leadership, entry into higher adjacent growth markets and tuck-in M&A. Total company third quarter operational sales grew 10% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus 2019, just below our guidance of 12% to 14% versus 2020 as Delta impacted procedure volume globally. 
Despite the temporary impact of procedure volumes, we saw strength in new product launches, generated robust clinical evidence and executed broadly across the portfolio. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.41 grew 10.5% versus 2020 and 4% versus 2019, reaching the high end of our third quarter guidance range of $0.39 to $0.41. Adjusted operating margin at 25.6% continues to improve and was in line with our third quarter expectations. 
We continue to be pleased with our cash flow with third quarter free cash flow generation of $360 million and adjusted free cash flow of $525 million. We're updating our fourth quarter and our full year guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which assumes some level of impact to procedures from COVID and staffing shortages. 
Compared to 2020, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 16% and full year growth of 18% to 19%. Compared to 2019, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 4% to 8% and for full year organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus 2019. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.43 to $0.45, and we're updating full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.60 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance and outlook, including the revenue contribution from our acquisitions this year. I'll now provide additional highlights in Q3 '21 results along with comments on our fourth quarter and '21 outlook. 
Within the regions on an operational basis Q3 2020, the U.S. grew 15%. Europe, Mid-East Africa grew 8%, Asia Pac grew 8% and the emerging market sales grew 18%. Operationally, despite the impact from Delta, EMEA delivered solid growth in third quarter across the majority of businesses and countries with notable strength in PI, EP and Endo, fueled by new and ongoing product launches like TheraSphere, POLARx and Axios. We continue NOI performance with strong utilization driving double-digit growth versus both '20 and 2019. 
Asia Pac was impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns in parts of the region, though growth in China remained very strong. We're encouraged heading into fourth quarter in 2022 as countries within Asia Pac are reopening as vaccination rates increase and COVID cases declined. 
Although Japan was in the state of emergency throughout third quarter, we were able to advance new product launches, achieving #1 share position with our Ranger drug-coated balloon as well as launching POLARx in October. China continues to deliver excellent results and sales grew 14% versus 2020. We continue to see momentum across the portfolio driven by complex PCI and imaging as well as new product launches like Eluvia and Axos. 
Digital tools are also playing a role, enabling virtual physician training and allowing us to expand our reach with differentiated products like IVUS. We continue to expect double-digit full year 2021 growth from China versus both 2020 and 2019. I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. 
Urology and Pelvic Health sales grew 7% organically versus 2020. And the Luminus acquisition closed in September, which expands the urology portfolio and stone offering to include the Moses laser, which is complementary to the LithoVue single-use flexible ureteroscope in our broad portfolio of disposables that support kidney stone removal. 
The prostate health franchise grew double digits with continued strength in our resume and SpaceOAR businesses, and we're excited to initiate 2 trials in this space within the quarter. The global SABRE clinical trial, which will examine the effectiveness of SpaceOAR review in reducing late toxicity in patients receiving a stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer; and the VAPOR trial, which compares resume to dual drug therapy for BPH. 
Our elective procedures within the pelvic health portfolio were impacted by the third quarter surge in Delta. But historical growth trends have shown a quicker recovery as COVID surges wane. 
In Endoscopy, sales grew 11% organically versus 2020. Our market-leading global endoscopy portfolio continues to benefit from differentiated, innovative technology launches, including Axios, Resolution Ultra hemostasis clip and single-use scopes. During the quarter, EXALT B received FDA clearance and is now available in both U.S. and Europe, with physicians pleased with this image quality and section capabilities. 
We continue to make progress with EXALT-D and are launching the 1.5 enhanced EXALT-D design, which features improved physician ergonomics. Additionally, we're pleased to now have approximately 40% of ERCP procedures qualify for additional reimbursement with NTAP approval as of October 1. 
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales were flat versus 2020. SICD sales grew mid-single digits versus Q3 '19, supported by the launch of the enhanced electrode. While core CRM third quarter trends improved over first half '21 across both fit and Pacer, we believe that growth likely to lag the market. Looking ahead, we anticipate stabilization in our core CRM growth exiting 2021 and to early 2022, supported by S-ICD and our differentiated HeartLogic offering. 
Within our Diagnostics franchise, our Lux Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to gain share as physicians are pleased with the implant experience, technology and remote programming capability. Our preventive business remains on track to deliver plus 20% growth for the full year versus 2020 on a pro forma basis, fueled by the broad and differentiated ambulatory ECG portfolio. Electrophysiology organic sales were up 10% versus 2020, driven by strong international sales in both Europe and Japan. 
International growth is well above market, driven by the innovative portfolio, including POLARx and StablePoint. POLARx is recently approved in Japan with the first cases occurring in October. In addition, the FROZEN-AF trial completed enrollment, which represents an important step in bringing POLARx to the U.S. with an expected launch in 2023. 
We also closed our Farapulse acquisition in third quarter, which is the only commercially available PFA technology, and we are seeing strong early usage in a limited number of launched accounts in Europe. 
Finally, we announced our acquisition of Baylis Medical, further enabling our strategy of category leadership with a novel approach to left heart access. Within the U.S., the Baylis platform is used in close to 40% of EP ablation procedures on the left side of the heart. Furthermore, it is used in left atrial appendage closure and mitral valve intervention. We expect to close this acquisition in first quarter 2022. 
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020 as underlying procedure volumes was impacted by the Delta surge throughout much of the quarter. Within our pain management franchise, we continue to see excitement for our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system and differentiated fast algorithm as well as our Cagnita digital solution. 
Within deep brain stimulation, the majority of our accounts have transitioned to precise genus, and we continue to drive new account openings as physicians are pleased with the integrated platform and personalized therapy. And last week, we received approval for our essential tremor indication and are excited to begin our limited launch in fourth quarter 2021, which to expand our addressable market by $2 billion. 
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 26% versus 2020, which includes a 1,200 basis point tailwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve taken in third quarter '20. Our WATCHMAN franchise had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as physicians continue to be pleased with the next-generation of Flex performance and differentiated clinical data. This positive sentiment has been further supported by ongoing real-world clinical evidence presented at HRS, demonstrating high rates of effective LAA closure and low rates of complications post procedure. 
We continue to innovate and are launching our fixed curve sheet, offering greater deployment control and ability to reach an expanded range of anatomies. We also anticipate enabling our U.S. label to include DAP to support physician and patient choice in patient implant care by year-end. 
In TAVR, ACURATE NEO 2 continues to do well with physicians pleased with his clinical performance and ease of use, backed by strong real-world clinical data, resulting in approximately 20% market share in open accounts. Momentum continues with Sentinel, our cerebral embolic protection device, which is exceeding 20% share in the U.S., where it's utilized. 
Coronary Therapies grew 8% versus 2020 as the China DES tender impact begins to annualize and our portfolio mix shift into higher growth markets continues to strengthen. We continue to see excellent growth in complex PCI and imaging being driven by ROTAPRO and IVUS. We also just received FDA clearance for V-Go 2, our next-generation guidance platform. 
Purple Interventions consistently delivers with organic sales up 8% versus Q3 2020. TheraSphere was a standout once again and grew double digits in the quarter with continued momentum for the positive EPOC trial, a first of its kind where TheraSphere was studied as second-line therapy with their primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with MCRC was met. 
Additionally, we've begun patient enrollment in the MANDARIN trial, an important first step for bringing HCC treatment to China patients. In Arterial, our drug ILUVIEN portfolio continues to perform well, growing double digits versus 2020 with positive late-breaking clinical data presented at Veeva earlier this month. 
Eluvia, our drug Lunesta, exhibited superiority in the imminent trial compared to bare metal stents and 2-year data from the RANGER 2 trial demonstrated continued high rates, primary patency and significant reduction in reinterventions with our Ranger DCB. In venous, we continue to push forward with our first patient enrolled in the High PETRO trial. We also had late-breaking clinical data from the knockout PE registry presented at Veeva confirming the safety and efficacy of ECOs. 
Building our strategy of category leadership, we announced our acquisition of Devora Medical and the Wolf thrombectomy platform, which is an innovative technology designed to rapidly capture and extract blood clots in arterial and venous systems while minimizing blood loss. We look forward to closing this acquisition in fourth quarter '21. 
More broadly, we're furthering our commitment to sustainability, and I'm proud to report that Boston Scientific is joining the United Nations Race to Zero campaign. And since 2017, we've reduced the BSC carbon footprint by 50% and are on track to meet our goal to be carbon neutral in all manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030. 
We're building on this foundation to establish ambitious science-based targets to set us on a path to net 0 emissions across our entire value chain. We are bullish about the future outlook of Boston Scientific. At our recent Investor Day, we detailed our LRP plans for growth of 6% to 8% growth, operating margin expansion of 50 basis points or more each year and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. I'd like to extend a big thank you to our employees for their contributions and winning spirit. And I'll now turn things over to Dan."

Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.932 billion represents 10.3% reported revenue growth versus the third quarter of 2020 and reflects a $17 million tailwind from foreign exchange. .
On an operational basis, revenue growth was 9.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus contributed 220 basis points more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting in 10.6% organic revenue growth, slightly below our guidance range of 12% to 14% growth versus 2020. 
Compared to the third quarter 2019, organic growth was 4.1%, below our guidance range of 5% to 7%. This 4.1% growth excludes $35 million in 2019 sales of divested intrauterine health, embolic beads and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses as well as $117 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of half a quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines, a full quarter of preventive and post-close revenue from Farapulse and Luminus. 
Spend controls and a favorable tax rate drove Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, representing 10.5% growth versus 2020, 4% growth versus 2019 and achieving the high end of our guidance range of $0.39 to $0.41. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.6%, in line with our expectations. We expect slight sequential improvements to continue in Q4 as some headwinds remain, in particular, the transient cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures, increased freight costs and some price pressures on direct materials and wages. 
Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, again, in line with our expectations, driven by spend control and lower travel offsetting the revenue headwinds. We're pleased with our trajectory and continue to target adjusted operating margin to average 26% for the second half of this year. 
On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 13.2% and includes a $128 million intangible asset impairment primarily related to VENITI, as we've made the decision to retire the VICI venous stent following our voluntary recall earlier this year. Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $104 million, again, in line with expectations. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 7.8% on an adjusted basis, favorable to our expectations, driven by the geographic mix of earnings. We ended Q3 with 1,436 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $525 million, and free cash flow was $359 million with $465 million from operating activities, less $106 million net capital expenditures. 
Our goal remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020, approximately $2 billion as we continue to expect increased working capital investments in inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of $1.9 billion. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Devora Medical in Q4 of this year and Baylis Medical Company in Q1 of 2022. 
Our top priority for capital remains tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess additional opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. I'll now walk through guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2021. 
For the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 19% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 30 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus. 
Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year organic revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 19% versus 2020 and 5% to 6% versus 2019. For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in specialty pharmaceutical sales and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $530 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including [indiscernible] BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August, Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus as well as $13 million of specialty pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture. 
For the fourth quarter 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 18% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 180 basis point tailwind from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus, partially offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceutical. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect Q4 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 16% versus 2020 and 4% to 8% growth versus 2019. For the Q4 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude in sales of our divested intrauterine health and specialty pharmaceuticals businesses. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude $90 million -- approximately $90 million in sales from the acquisition of Preventice, Farapulse and Luminus. 
We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. Based on year-to-date favorability, we now forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 10% and  our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.439 million shares for Q4 2021 and 1,434 million shares for the full year 2021. 
We are narrowing the range for full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.60 to $1.62, which includes our update to sales guidance and considers Q3 performing at the high end of our guidance range. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.43 to $0.45. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q3 results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A."

Overall, clearly, when you travel outside of the U.S., the vaccination rates are improving in the Western countries, Japan, South Korea, Australia, vaccination rates are improving in Europe. And you know with the vaccination status is here. 
So overall, we are more optimistic about the improved growth in fourth quarter versus third quarter based on the improved vaccination rates, although we do expect COVID still to be a bit spotty, we also highlighted some of the staffing challenges. So overall, based on the guidance, we do anticipate an improved fourth quarter versus third quarter, but we're still guarded given the staffing challenges at some locations and COVID."

It's just a sheer number of macro issues to kind of think through from staffing, the COVID waves to supply chain to inflation. And that's before we even start to look at company fundamentals. 
So I guess, one big picture question I'd ask you, Mike, is all that's making it kind of hard for investors to know how to think about modeling for the next 12 months. And so I just would love your kind of top-down thoughts on the ability of Boston to deliver over the next 12 months, given all these headwinds. I'm not asking for a specific quantification of things. But just your ability to manage through all these headwinds?"

So if you think about that, you take a step back and look at third quarter, and that's why I started my script that I'm really proud of the team's global execution. Because if you think about it, we went through a Delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus '19. Now 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number growing 4% given the Delta surge. 
And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone is familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. 
So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well. Clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins and we hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about. But we do anticipate moving forward that the impact on COVID and the company has -- when the surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. 
One great thing about our portfolio is we're primarily interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple of sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their WATCHMAN volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in WATCHMAN, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in the quarter, where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good."

I made a comment earlier about the procedural trends, how efficient the procedure is being done with the WATCHMAN FLX. Every doctor that we speak -- that I've spoken with, which is quite a few in our field, doctors that have transitioned, which 99.9% of them have from A 2 -- from 2.5 to WATCHMAN FLX have increased utilization significantly. And they've done that because of the safety profile of the device and the outcomes that they're getting. 
And then you see, right now, we have some additional product enhancements being launched with the with delivery catheter. And we have a cadence of additional platforms being developed over the next 2 years as well as expanding clinical outcomes.

The performance of that platform is quite good in terms of its section capability. And our team is ramping up supply chain manufacturing capabilities to enhance supply for EXALT B in 2022.

So I think it's a dynamic market where there's a lot of new product enhancements, but I think our team in Valencia, our Neuromod businesses, we think best-in-breed in terms of innovation. 
Almost all of their innovations come internally, whether it be DBS or SCS. And they always have a pretty strong impressive cadence of new launches every 18 months. So I put our team against anybody in SCS, at least so far in the third quarter, we gained share in this fast algorithm that's just in its early days of launching. 
Really, the business, as you know, Joanne, has been impacted by COVID. Our Urology and neuromod businesses are the 2 businesses that are the most sensitive surges and the most responsive when COVID wanes. And so hopefully, the COVID trends will continue globally and you'll see improvement in both urology and Neuromod in fourth quarter as COVID continues to stabilize.

But it doesn't do well when COVID surges because of the duration of the procedure time and the fact that it typically can be deferred a few months back to your backlog question. 
On the business itself, they've done an amazing job. We weren't a player at all 6, 7 years ago. And now we're the #1 de novo market share leader in Europe. I would say we're probably likely tied for #1 on de novo market share in the U.S. and the team continues to add sales and commercial resources.

First of all, WATCHMAN, the clinical results for WATCHMAN FLX are extraordinarily good. And doctors have tremendous confidence in the platform, and they've been using it for about a year. And your average doctor is increasing their utilization of WATCHMAN every quarter because of the confidence that they have and the referring physician community is seeing their patients recover and get off blood thinners and reduce the risk of stroke. So it's expanding the awareness in the referring physician community, the GI community, the neuro community. So there's a lot of momentum there. 
And the other important thing, I mentioned that productivity even in COVID, you have hospitals dramatically moving WATCHMAN, limiting anesthesia, using ICE imaging and doing procedures that are very, very efficient. In many cases, less than an hour. And economics of WATCHMAN now are quite good across the U.S. 
So there's always headwinds and tailwinds across a diversified portfolio. But the tailwinds from reimbursement, procedural efficiency, clinical outcomes, new clinical data, product cadence are very, very positive with WATCHMAN."

And it is an issue for hospital CEOs. There's no doubt about it. They've had to increase their wages and labor force expenses to accommodate increasing wages for nurses and staff and so forth. So they're doing -- they're working through that process. 
But it's not going to be a short-term issue, but hospitals are pretty resilient. And as you know, a couple of things I would say that point specific to BSC and how that's changing is just the use of telehealth and telemedicine and prescreening for patients has become very widespread and very efficient. That reduces down significantly the number of patient visits to the hospital, drives more efficiency and staff productivity. 
So I think you're going to continue to see that trend continue to increase. Another one more specific to Boston, as what I mentioned before, is we're not a surgery company. So we're not driving multi-day length of stays in a hospital. 
The portfolio shift -- the shift to interventional medicine is helpful for hospitals. And it gets patients in and out of a clinic or outpatient setting typically in the same day. And you see more of our complex procedures because of the capabilities and the technology we have augmented by imaging move to more outpatient settings. 
And I made the comment on WATCHMAN, how that mix shift has moved more and more to same-day procedure. So I think a combination of telehealth, a combination of outpatient orientation and same-day procedures is very helpful for our product mix. And hospitals, just like anybody else, they innovate and they find a way. 
So it is a headwind. But it's -- in the quarter here where we had staffing shortages and at surge, we grew okay. And I think the surges will calm and the staffing shorters will likely linger a bit, but hospitals are pretty resilient in figuring out ways to drive volume."

So what I'm curious about is what you're seeing in non-COVID geographies as far as the momentum in those businesses? Are you taking share with some of these new products? Are you seeing accelerating momentum with some of these new categories? And why wouldn't that accelerate coming out of Cove just given some of the underlying strength that I think is there?"

So that division continues to do very well. Endo, I would put them despite COVID, grew 8% versus '19 in the quarter in a number of new product launches. Euro has been impacted by COVID, but that typically bounces back when COVID improves. And we've got a lot of commentary on WATCHMAN today. We saw strong EP growth in Europe. We continue to lag in the U.S., but the EP momentum we see in Europe and Japan is very encouraging based on the -- on our cryo capabilities as well as the early insights into Farapulse.

Mike mentioned this earlier that businesses like Neuromodulation and urology, they come down very quickly in a COVID wave. The good news is they come back very quickly. So it's kind of a V-shaped curve for those businesses. 
So they obviously don't perform as well in a COVID setting. But they come back very nicely on the other side. So it really -- there's not really one number you can point to for the whole company and pinpoint it. It varies by business.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less in a period of -- a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures include BTG Spec Pharma, which closed on March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively.  
Guidance excludes the recently announced Devoro Medical and Baylis Medical acquisitions, which are expected to close in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22, respectively. For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.  
On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8% ex-COVID represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'd note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.

I'm proud of our global team's execution despite the various challenges presented by the COVID surge in third quarter. The third quarter was impacted by COVID more than we anticipated as the Delta variant surged globally and some elective procedures were deferred.
While we aren't satisfied with this quarter's sales results, we delivered on our third quarter EPS and margin targets. And we're confident that as global vaccination rates continue to increase and COVID wanes, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term sales goals.
We continue to be excited and confident about the opportunities we laid out at our recent Investor Day, further enabled by our strategy of category leadership, entry into higher adjacent growth markets and tuck-in M&A. Total company third quarter operational sales grew 10% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus 2019, just below our guidance of 12% to 14% versus 2020 as Delta impacted procedure volume globally.
Despite the temporary impact of procedure volumes, we saw strength in new product launches, generated robust clinical evidence and executed broadly across the portfolio. Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.41 grew 10.5% versus 2020 and 4% versus 2019, reaching the high end of our third quarter guidance range of $0.39 to $0.41. Adjusted operating margin at 25.6% continues to improve and was in line with our third quarter expectations.
We continue to be pleased with our cash flow with third quarter free cash flow generation of $360 million and adjusted free cash flow of $525 million. We're updating our fourth quarter and our full year guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which assumes some level of impact to procedures from COVID and staffing shortages.
Compared to 2020, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 16% and full year growth of 18% to 19%. Compared to 2019, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 4% to 8% and for full year organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus 2019.
Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.43 to $0.45, and we're updating full year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.60 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance and outlook, including the revenue contribution from our acquisitions this year. I'll now provide additional highlights in Q3 '21 results along with comments on our fourth quarter and '21 outlook.
Within the regions on an operational basis Q3 2020, the U.S. grew 15%. Europe, Mid-East Africa grew 8%, Asia Pac grew 8% and the emerging market sales grew 18%. Operationally, despite the impact from Delta, EMEA delivered solid growth in third quarter across the majority of businesses and countries with notable strength in PI, EP and Endo, fueled by new and ongoing product launches like TheraSphere,  POLARx and AXIOS. We continue Neo2 performance with strong utilization driving double-digit growth versus both '20 and 2019.  
Asia Pac was impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns in parts of the region, though growth in China remained very strong. We're encouraged heading into fourth quarter in 2022 as countries within Asia Pac are reopening as vaccination rates increase and COVID cases declined.
Although Japan was in the state of emergency throughout third quarter, we were able to advance new product launches, achieving #1 share position with our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon as well as launching POLARx in October. 
China continues to deliver excellent results and sales grew 14% versus 2020. We continue to see momentum across the portfolio driven by complex PCI and imaging as well as new product launches like Eluvia and AXIOS.  
Digital tools are also playing a role, enabling virtual physician training and allowing us to expand our reach with differentiated products like IVUS. We continue to expect double-digit full year 2021 growth from China versus both 2020 and 2019. I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units.
Urology and Pelvic Health sales grew 7% organically versus 2020. And the Lumenis acquisition closed in September, which expands the urology portfolio and stone offering to include the Moses laser, which is complementary to the LithoVue single-use flexible ureteroscope in our broad portfolio of disposables that support kidney stone removal.
The Prostate Health franchise grew double digits with continued strength in our Rezum and SpaceOAR businesses, and we're excited to initiate 2 trials in this space within the quarter. The global SABRE clinical trial, which will examine the effectiveness of SpaceOAR review in reducing late toxicity in patients receiving a stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer and the VAPOR trial, which compares resume to dual drug therapy for BPH.
Our elective procedures within the pelvic health portfolio were impacted by the third quarter surge in Delta. But historical growth trends have shown a quicker recovery as COVID surges wane.
In Endoscopy, sales grew 11% organically versus 2020. Our market-leading global endoscopy portfolio continues to benefit from differentiated, innovative technology launches, including AXIOS, Resolution Ultra hemostasis clip and single-use scopes. During the quarter, EXALT B received FDA clearance and is now available in both U.S. and Europe, with physicians pleased with this image quality and flexion capabilities.
We continue to make progress with EXALT-D and are launching the 1.5 enhanced EXALT-D design, which features improved physician ergonomics. Additionally, we're pleased to now have approximately 40% of ERCP procedures qualify for additional reimbursement with NTAP approval as of October 1.  
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales were flat versus 2020. SICD sales grew mid-single digits versus Q3 '19, supported by the launch of the enhanced electrode. While core CRM third quarter trends improved over first half '21 across both Defib and Pacer, we believe that growth likely to lag the market. Looking ahead, we anticipate stabilization in our core CRM growth exiting 2021 and to early 2022, supported by S-ICD and our differentiated HeartLogic offering.  
Within our Diagnostics franchise, our Lux-Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to gain share as physicians are pleased with the implant experience, technology and remote programming capability. Our preventive business remains on track to deliver plus 20% growth for the full year versus 2020 on a pro forma basis, fueled by the broad and differentiated ambulatory ECG portfolio. 
Electrophysiology organic sales were up 10% versus 2020, driven by strong international sales in both Europe and Japan. International growth is well above market, driven by the innovative portfolio, including POLARx and StablePoint. POLARx is recently approved in Japan with the first cases occurring in October. In addition, the FROZEN-AF trial completed enrollment, which represents an important step in bringing POLARx to the U.S. with an expected launch in 2023.
We also closed our Farapulse acquisition in third quarter, which is the only commercially available PFA technology, and we are seeing strong early usage in a limited number of launched accounts in Europe.  
Finally, we announced our acquisition of Baylis Medical, further enabling our strategy of category leadership with a novel approach to left heart access. Within the U.S., the Baylis platform is used in close to 40% of EP ablation procedures on the left side of the heart. Furthermore, it is used in left atrial appendage closure and mitral valve intervention. We expect to close this acquisition in first quarter 2022.
In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020 as underlying procedure volumes was impacted by the Delta surge throughout much of the quarter. Within our pain management franchise, we continue to see excitement for our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system and differentiated fast algorithm as well as our Cagnita digital solution.  
Within deep brain stimulation, the majority of our accounts have transitioned to precise genus, and we continue to drive new account openings as physicians are pleased with the integrated platform and personalized therapy. In last week, we received approval for our essential tremor indication and are excited to begin our limited launch in fourth quarter 2021, which to expand our addressable market by $2 billion.
In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 26% versus 2020, which includes a 1,200 basis point tailwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve taken in third quarter '20. Our WATCHMAN franchise had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as physicians continue to be pleased with the next-generation of Flex performance and differentiated clinical data. This positive sentiment has been further supported by ongoing real-world clinical evidence presented at HRS demonstrating high rates of effective LAA closure and low rates of complications post procedure.
We continue to innovate and are launching our fixed curve sheet, offering greater deployment control and ability to reach an expanded range of anatomies. We also anticipate enabling our U.S. label to include DAPT to support physician and patient choice and patient implant care by year-end.
In TAVR, ACURATE neo 2 continues to do well with physicians pleased with his clinical performance and ease of use, backed by strong real-world clinical data, resulting in approximately 20% market share in open accounts. Momentum continues with Sentinel, our cerebral embolic protection device, which is exceeding 20% share in the U.S., where it's utilized.
Coronary Therapies grew 8% versus 2020 as the China DES tender impact begins to annualize and our portfolio mix shift into higher growth markets continues to strengthen. We continue to see excellent growth in complex PCI and imaging being driven by ROTAPRO and IVUS. We also just received FDA clearance for [ AVVIGO ]2, our next-generation guidance platform.  
Peripheral Interventions consistently delivers with organic sales up 8% versus Q3 2020. TheraSphere was a standout once again and grew double digits in the quarter with continued momentum for the positive EPOC trial, a first of its kind where TheraSphere was studied as second-line therapy with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with mCRC was met.
Additionally, we've begun patient enrollment in the MANDARIN  trial, an important first step for bringing HCC treatment to China patients. In Arterial, our Drug Eluting portfolio continues to perform well, growing double digits versus 2020 with positive late-breaking clinical data presented at VIVA earlier this month.
Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent exhibited superiority in the EMINENT trial compared to bare-metal stents and 2-year data from the RANGER 2 trial demonstrated continued high rates, primary patency and significant reduction in reinterventions with our Ranger DCB. 
In venous, we continue to push forward with our first patient enrolled in the HI-PEITHO trial. We also had late-breaking clinical data from the knockout PE registry presented at Veeva confirming the safety and efficacy of EKOS. 
Building our strategy of category leadership, we announced our acquisition of Devora Medical and the WOLF thrombectomy platform, which is an innovative technology designed to rapidly capture and extract blood clots in arterial and venous systems while minimizing blood loss. We look forward to closing this acquisition in fourth quarter '21.
More broadly, we're furthering our commitment to sustainability, and I'm proud to report that Boston Scientific is joining the United Nations Race to Zero campaign. And since 2017, we've reduced the BSC carbon footprint by 50% and are on track to meet our goal to be carbon neutral in all manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030.
We're building on this foundation to establish ambitious science-based targets to set us on a path to net 0 emissions across our entire value chain. We are bullish about the future outlook of Boston Scientific. At our recent Investor Day, we detailed our LRP plans for growth of 6% to 8% growth, operating margin expansion of 50 basis points or more each year and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. I'd like to extend a big thank you to our employees for their contributions and winning spirit. And I'll now turn things over to Dan."

Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.932 billion represents 10.3% reported revenue growth versus the third quarter of 2020 and reflects a $17 million tailwind from foreign exchange.On an operational basis, revenue growth was 9.7% in th",965,"Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.932 billion represents 10.3% reported revenue growth versus the third quarter of 2020 and reflects a $17 million tailwind from foreign exchange.
On an operational basis, revenue growth was 9.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis contributed 220 basis points more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting in 10.6% organic revenue growth, slightly below our guidance range of 12% to 14% growth versus 2020. 
Compared to the third quarter 2019, organic growth was 4.1%, below our guidance range of 5% to 7%. This 4.1% growth excludes $35 million in 2019 sales of divested intrauterine health, embolic beads and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses as well as $117 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of half a quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines, a full quarter of preventive and post-close revenue from Farapulse and Lumenis. 
Spend controls and a favorable tax rate drove Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.41, representing 10.5% growth versus 2020, 4% growth versus 2019 and achieving the high end of our guidance range of $0.39 to $0.41. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.6%, in line with our expectations. We expect slight sequential improvements to continue in Q4 as some headwinds remain, in particular, the transient cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures, increased freight costs and some price pressures on direct materials and wages.
Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, again, in line with our expectations, driven by spend control and lower travel offsetting the revenue headwinds. We're pleased with our trajectory and continue to target adjusted operating margin to average 26% for the second half of this year.
On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 13.2% and includes a $128 million intangible asset impairment primarily related to VENITI, as we've made the decision to retire the VICI venous stent following our voluntary recall earlier this year. Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $104 million, again, in line with expectations. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 7.8% on an adjusted basis, favorable to our expectations, driven by the geographic mix of earnings. We ended Q3 with 1,436 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $525 million, and free cash flow was $359 million with $465 million from operating activities, less $106 million net capital expenditures. 
Our goal remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020, approximately $2 billion as we continue to expect increased working capital investments in inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of $1.9 billion. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Devora Medical in Q4 of this year and Baylis Medical Company in Q1 of 2022.
Our top priority for capital remains tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess additional opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. I'll now walk through guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2021.
For the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 19% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 30 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis. 
Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year organic revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 19% versus 2020 and 5% to 6% versus 2019. For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in specialty pharmaceutical sales and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $530 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including [indiscernible] BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August, Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis as well as $13 million of specialty pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.
For the fourth quarter 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 18% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 180 basis point tailwind from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis, partially offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceutical.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect Q4 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 16% versus 2020 and 4% to 8% growth versus 2019. For the Q4 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $67 million in sales of our divested intrauterine health and specialty pharmaceuticals businesses. And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude $90 million -- approximately $90 million in sales from the acquisition of Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis.
We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. Based on year-to-date favorability, we now forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 10% and  our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.439 million shares for Q4 2021 and 1,434 million shares for the full year 2021. 
We are narrowing the range for full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.60 to $1.62, which includes our update to sales guidance and considers Q3 performing at the high end of our guidance range. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.43 to $0.45. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q3 results.
With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A."

And we provided our fourth quarter sales guidance here.
Overall, clearly, when you travel outside of the U.S., the vaccination rates are improving in the Western countries, Japan, South Korea, Australia, vaccination rates are improving in Europe. And you know with the vaccination status is here. 
So overall, we are more optimistic about the improved growth in fourth quarter versus third quarter based on the improved vaccination rates, although we do expect COVID still to be a bit spotty, we also highlighted some of the staffing challenges. So overall, based on the guidance, we do anticipate an improved fourth quarter versus third quarter, but we're still guarded given the staffing challenges at some locations and COVID."

It's just a sheer number of macro issues to kind of think through from staffing, the COVID waves to supply chain to inflation. And that's before we even start to look at company fundamentals.
So I guess, one big picture question I'd ask you, Mike, is all that's making it kind of hard for investors to know how to think about modeling for the next 12 months. And so I just would love your kind of top-down thoughts on the ability of Boston to deliver over the next 12 months, given all these headwinds. I'm not asking for a specific quantification of things. But just your ability to manage through all these headwinds?"

So if you think about that, you take a step back and look at third quarter, and that's why I started my script that I'm really proud of the team's global execution. Because if you think about it, we went through a Delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus '19. Now 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number growing 4% given the Delta surge. 
And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone is familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth.
So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well. Clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins and we hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about. But we do anticipate moving forward that the impact on COVID and the company has -- when the surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. 
One great thing about our portfolio is we're primarily interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple of sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their WATCHMAN volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in WATCHMAN, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in the quarter, where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good."

Every doctor that we speak -- that I've spoken with, which is quite a few in our field, doctors that have transitioned, which 99.9% of them have from A 2 -- from 2.5 to WATCHMAN FLX have increased utilization significantly. And they've done that because of the safety profile of the device and the outcomes that they're getting.
And then you see, right now, we have some additional product enhancements being launched with the with delivery catheter. And we have a cadence of additional platforms being developed over the next 2 years as well as expanding clinical outcomes.

Almost all of their innovations come internally, whether it be DBS or SCS. And they always have a pretty strong impressive cadence of new launches every 18 months. So I put our team against anybody in SCS, at least so far in the third quarter, we gained share in this fast algorithm that's just in its early days of launching.
Really, the business, as you know, Joanne, has been impacted by COVID. Our Urology and Neuromod businesses are the two businesses that are the most sensitive in surges and the most responsive when COVID wanes. And so hopefully, the COVID trends will continue globally and you'll see improvement in both urology and Neuromod in fourth quarter as COVID continues to stabilize. So that's been a business that's been challenged during COVID as have our competitors, but we expect that business to improve quite a bit as COVID improves."

The staffing shortages are a bit of a challenge, but the hospitals do hustle, and they figure out a way to get things done. But it does create a bit of a headwind, but COVID should be better.
In the backlog, you do see a backlog in some of our procedures. You see a WATCHMAN backlog and in other areas. So Overall, I hope -- I think the macro trends should point to better in '22 versus what we've seen in '21 given the vaccination rates broadly."

So hopefully, you'll see an improvement in fourth quarter across the board in the market, in particular with us, and in '22 as COVID improves. But it doesn't do well when COVID surges because of the duration of the procedure time and the fact that it typically can be deferred a few months back to your backlog question.
On the business itself, they've done an amazing job. We weren't a player at all 6, 7 years ago. And now we're the #1 de novo market share leader in Europe. I would say we're probably likely tied for #1 on de novo market share in the U.S. and the team continues to add sales and commercial resources. And the new indication, obviously, will help that business in 2022 now that we have -- now that we're on label.
So it's a similar call point, a similar physician, the same commercial team that we have. So it's almost like an adjacency for us with the same physician and the same sales rep.

First of all, WATCHMAN, the clinical results for WATCHMAN FLX are extraordinarily good. And doctors have tremendous confidence in the platform, and they've been using it for about a year. And your average doctor is increasing their utilization of WATCHMAN every quarter because of the confidence that they have and the referring physician community is seeing their patients recover and get off blood thinners and reduce the risk of stroke. So it's expanding the awareness in the referring physician community, the GI community, the neuro community. So there's a lot of momentum there.
And the other important thing, I mentioned that productivity even in COVID, you have hospitals dramatically moving WATCHMAN, limiting anesthesia, using ICE imaging and doing procedures that are very, very efficient. In many cases, less than an hour. And economics of WATCHMAN now are quite good across the U.S.
So there's always headwinds and tailwinds across a diversified portfolio. But the tailwinds from reimbursement, procedural efficiency, clinical outcomes, new clinical data, product cadence are very, very positive with WATCHMAN."

And it is an issue for hospital CEOs. There's no doubt about it. They've had to increase their wages and labor force expenses to accommodate increasing wages for nurses and staff and so forth. So they're doing -- they're working through that process.
But it's not going to be a short-term issue, but hospitals are pretty resilient. And as you know, a couple of things I would say that point specific to BSC and how that's changing is just the use of telehealth and telemedicine and prescreening for patients has become very widespread and very efficient. That reduces down significantly the number of patient visits to the hospital, drives more efficiency and staff productivity.
So I think you're going to continue to see that trend continue to increase. Another one more specific to Boston, as what I mentioned before, is we're not a surgery company. So we're not driving multi-day length of stays in a hospital.
The portfolio shift -- the shift to interventional medicine is helpful for hospitals. And it gets patients in and out of a clinic or outpatient setting typically in the same day. And you see more of our complex procedures because of the capabilities and the technology we have augmented by imaging move to more outpatient settings. And I made the comment on WATCHMAN, how that mix shift has moved more and more to same-day procedure.
So I think a combination of telehealth, a combination of outpatient orientation and same-day procedures is very helpful for our product mix. And hospitals, just like anybody else, they innovate and they find a way. 
So it is a headwind. But it's -- in the quarter here where we had staffing shortages and at surge, we grew okay. And I think the surges will calm and the staffing shortages will likely linger a bit, but hospitals are pretty resilient in figuring out ways to drive volume."

Mike mentioned this earlier that businesses like Neuromodulation and Urology, they come down very quickly in a COVID wave. The good news is they come back very quickly. So it's kind of a V-shaped curve for those businesses.

And as Mike's comments, preclude that's what we're looking forward to in '22 and beyond."

And the WATCHMAN FLX device, which is now the device that we commercialize in the United States, is really set the standard for safety and for efficacy.
And just to remind everyone, our PINNACLE FLX trial results with WATCHMAN FLX show less than 1% procedural safety events. No pericardial fusions in that trial through 7 days. No device embolizations, and 100% effective left atrial appendage closure. And I just don't think there's anything else out there that approaches those numbers. So as Mike said, as Ian said, we remain highly bullish and highly confident in the continued success of WATCHMAN."
