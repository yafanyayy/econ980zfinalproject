Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Caterpillar's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager. During our call, we'll be discussing the earnings news release that we issued earlier this morning. Our slides from today, the news release and a video recap are all in the Investors section of caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations. 
The forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that, individually or in aggregate, could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. 
Caterpillar has a copyright of this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without a prior written approval. Today, we're reporting profit per share of $1.42 for the quarter and $5.46 for the year. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share of $2.12 for the fourth quarter excluded remeasurement losses of $0.63 per share resulting from the settlement of pension and other postretirement obligations. It also excluded restructuring expenses of $0.07 per share, which Andrew will discuss. For the full year, adjusted profit per share of $6.56 excluded $0.55 per share resulting from the settlements of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and $0.55 per share in restructuring expenses. 
We provide a GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory, backlog, services revenues and full year 2020 numbers in our slides. Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Jim?"

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their resilience and performance during 2020, a year of unprecedented challenges. The Caterpillar team continued to provide the essential products and services that enabled our customers to support society during the pandemic. In this difficult environment, we leveraged our strong safety culture and had the best year on record for employee safety. Our employees' generous contributions and volunteerism are also notable. We had a record level of support for worldwide relief efforts in 2020 through the Caterpillar Foundation. 
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I plan to briefly cover the following topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Cat's fourth quarter results. I'll then provide comments on our performance for the full year, followed by some high-level thoughts about 2021. I'll close by highlighting several ways we're advancing our strategy. 
Starting on Slide 4, I'll recap fourth quarter results versus 1 year ago. Sales and revenues of $11.2 billion decreased 15%, about as we expected. Lower sales volume drove the decline reflecting lower end-user demand and reductions in dealer inventory. Dealers decreased their inventories by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, roughly $400 million more than we expected. For the full year, dealers reduced their inventories by $2.9 billion. This positions us well to produce closer to demand in 2021, which was our goal when we introduced our enhanced S&OP process. 
Fourth quarter sales to users declined by 10% versus the previous year. Sales to users for both construction and mining equipment were better than we expected. While fourth quarter 2020 operating margins declined year-on-year, they improved by 230 basis points versus the third quarter. At 12.3%, they were better than we expected, reflecting better operational performance. Restructuring expense was lower than we expected as was the effective tax rate. Profit per share in the fourth quarter was $1.42. Adjusted profit per share was $2.12. 
Regarding our full year results on Slide 5, we said at the start of the pandemic, it would be challenging to achieve the operating margin target we communicated during our 2019 Investor Day due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and supply chain as well as our intent to continue investing in new products and services to drive long-term profitable growth. So we're pleased that our final operating margin for 2020 was within our targeted range. We finished 2020 with sales and revenues of $41.7 billion and an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8%. Our ME&T free cash flow for the full year was $3.1 billion. While we did not achieve our target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion, our free cash flow performance improved as the year progressed. Our decision to hold higher Caterpillar inventory to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and to position ourselves for changes in market demand also impacted our free cash flow generation in 2020, as Andrew will discuss shortly. We remain focused on returning substantially all ME&T free cash to shareholders through the cycles and we returned $3.4 billion or 110% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases in 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide some comments on our end markets. Market conditions remain fluid due to the pandemic. However, I'll provide some thoughts based on what we see today. In Construction Industries, we see construction in North America benefiting from increased residential demand. We expect a strong selling season in China, including demand for our new GX excavator line. We expect continued recovery in the rest of Asia Pacific. The current shutdown in some regions of EAME may constrain construction activity in Europe in the short term. However, we expect improved market conditions due to favorable expansionary policies as well as benefits from higher commodity prices in Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia. In Latin America, we see Brazil's construction sector supportive of machine demand while weakness outside Brazil is expected to continue at least in the short term. 
Turning to Resource Industries. The improvement in mining fundamentals is expected to continue. We anticipate most mine sites to continue operating with limited disruptions and high levels of truck activity. In addition, metal prices are supportive of reinvestment and quoting activity continues to be robust. The number of parked trucks continues to decline. We continue to see strong interest in autonomy. Heavy construction and quarry in aggregate markets remain uncertain. A U.S. infrastructure bill would likely have a positive impact on these end markets. 
Moving to Energy & Transportation, we expect typical seasonality. Although we are encouraged by recent moves in oil prices, we expect oil and gas will continue to reflect conditions in that market. We expect some improvement in power generation supported by data center activity. We expect growth in industrial across all applications and transportation should grow due to services and higher international rail activity later in the year. Overall, we expect our sales in 2021 to be stronger due to the lack of a dealer inventory reduction and improving market conditions, as I've described. We also expect services revenues to increase during the year. 
Given the continuing uncertainty, we're not providing earnings guidance at this time. Andrew will provide several assumptions for the first quarter in a moment, but we expect the first quarter to benefit from stronger year-over-year sales to users and dealer restocking. We also expect modestly higher margins in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
You may recall that during our third quarter earnings call, I said that I felt better today than I did 1 quarter ago, and the same is true today for the reasons I explained earlier concerning our markets. In addition, we're executing well against our strategy for long-term profitable growth. We expect to achieve our Investor Day operating margin targets in 2021 despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. We also expect to meet our Investor Day free cash flow targets this year. Given our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders as well as our desire to be in the market on a regular basis, we expect to revisit our current pause in share repurchases later this year. 
We have paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, all decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year. 
We signed an agreement last quarter to acquire Weir's Oil & Gas business. We see a strong fit between Weir and our current offerings. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve our existing customer base while adding services revenue opportunities. We anticipate the acquisition will close very soon. 
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. We're focused on operational excellence and continue to invest in services and expanded offerings during the pandemic. An example of our continued investment in expanded offerings was our new GX line of excavators launched in November in China, which has received a positive response from our customers. The GX series provides the durability, safety and services that customers expect, plus 15% lower fuel consumption than the prior models. It also offers 25% lower maintenance cost. Our technology, along with our engineering know-how and global dealer network, has always played a pivotal role in making our customers more successful with Caterpillar. 
For the first time, we displayed some of our technology at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month. We featured Cat MineStar, a suite of technology and solutions that powers our autonomous trucks. With Cat MineStar, customers say their employees are safer, machines are more efficient and operations are more consistent and productive. Customers have realized productivity increases of up to 30% with 0 reportable injuries. We believe our autonomous capabilities provide a competitive advantage in mining. 
We were recently awarded research funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for 2 development projects. The first project, which is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, is a 3-year program for a hydrogen fuel cell system for data center power. The second project is expected to launch in mid-2021 and is a 3-year program related to a flexible natural gas and hydrogen combined heat and power system. 
Caterpillar announced 2020 sustainability goals in 2006, and we're proud of our progress. By 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 54% from our 2006 baseline exceeding our goal of 50% and more than 35% of our electrical energy was obtained from renewables or alternative sources exceeding our 2020 goal of 20%. We'll disclose our final 2020 goal attainment in May when we also plan to disclose our new sustainability goals for the next horizon. 
I'll also comment on services, which is an important element of our strategy. As you know, we have a target of doubling our services revenue from 2012 to 2026. Our annual services revenue declined 13% to $16 billion in 2020 versus the prior year. As we expected, services were less cyclical than original equipment and rose as a percentage of sales, representing 41% of ME&T sales in 2020. Year-over-year services declines reflected the reduction in machine hours related to the pandemic and customer decisions to delay planned maintenance and rebuilds as they sought to conserve cash. However, we did see an increase in customer value agreements, both in the number and the average length. With over 1 million connected assets, we feel we have critical mass from a connectivity perspective, which will leverage to increase services sales over time. 
In the coming year, we expect to return to growth in services. We did see positive momentum from the third to the fourth quarter of 2020. All 3 segments have detailed plans to increase services by making our customers more successful. 
In summary, we continue executing our strategy, improving operational excellence and investing in expanded offerings and services to help our customers succeed. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and intend to deliver higher margins and free cash flow through the cycles, as outlined during our 2019 Investor Day. We're grateful for our team's accomplishments in 2020, including their high level of engagement. We have a great team and will emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company, well positioned for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet before finishing with our key assumptions for the first quarter of 2021. 
Starting with the fourth quarter on Slide 8. Versus last year, sales and revenues declined by 15% to $11.2 billion. Operating profit decreased by 25% to $1.4 billion. Good cost control in the quarter partly offset the impacts of lower volume. Fourth quarter 2020 profit per share was $1.42. That include pretax remeasurement losses of $438 million or $0.63 per share, resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement obligations. Last year's profit per share for the fourth quarter was $1.97. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share was $2.12 compared to $2.71 last year. 
You will have seen from the release that the full year effective tax rate was approximately 28%, excluding discrete items. This was lower than the 31% rate we'd anticipated and added $0.26 to profit per share. We also had a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding restructuring expense, adds another $0.07 per share. The balance of the outperformance reflected better-than-expected operating results, which saw adjusted operating margin to improve by 170 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. 
Since 2019, we have only reported adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter when we have mark-to-market impacts from our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. This change happened because restructuring expense had returned to base levels, which was between $100 million and $200 million per annum. This was not considered material and did not warrant adjusting profit per share. However, restructuring expenses risen to $350 million this year as we took additional actions to address certain challenged products. We also expect restructuring expense in 2021 to be similar to or even greater than the 2020 total as we continue to take the necessary actions to improve our cost competitiveness. So we're now reporting adjusted profits per share excluding restructuring charges, and we'll report adjusted profit per share each quarter in the coming year to exclude restructuring. We've also adjusted the prior year numbers, so they're on a comparable basis. 
Our restructuring efforts in 2020 made good progress, and we expect $150 million benefit in 2021 from these actions. 
As shown on Slide 9, overall sales and revenues finished fairly close to what we anticipated in October as stronger end-user demand was offset by further reductions in dealer inventory. The top line declined by $1.9 billion to $11.2 billion, primarily due to lower volume and a larger year-on-year reduction in dealer inventory. As Jim mentioned, sales to users decreased by 10% for the fourth quarter. Sales to users for construction industries declined by 1% versus the prior year. It was a mixed bag geographically as Asia Pacific rose by 16%, benefiting from stimulus spending in China. Latin America also improved up 11%. And North America was down 8%, a solid improvement from the third quarter trend. Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, had a 3% decline for the quarter. Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 25%. The largest driver of that decline was attributed to lower levels of activity in oil and gas. 
Between earning calls, we've been reporting rolling 3-month sales to users every month. Going forward, w will report to sales to users only once per quarter when we discuss earnings so we can put them in the proper context. 
Machine orders improved in the fourth quarter as dealers began preparing for the spring selling season and the Chinese New Year. Machine orders accelerated by the double-digit percentage turns from the fourth third quarter to the fourth, in line with normal trends. Dealers decreased inventories by $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. That compares with a decrease of $700 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Improving sales to users enabled dealers to reduce their inventory by about $400 million more than we had anticipated in October. Dealers reduced inventory over the course of 2020 by $2.9 billion. This change brought their inventory levels to the lower end of their normal range for months of sales. As you know, dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions on inventory. 
In the first quarter of 2020, we finished the rollout of our new S&OP process which we believe promoted better alignment between us and our dealers through a volatile year. This dealer inventory reduction positions us well for 2021. 
Reported sales decreased versus the prior year in all 3 primary segments. Energy & Transportation contributed the majority of the decrease in total sales, declining by 19%. This segment had weakness in all 4 applications, led by oil and gas and transportation. Sales in Construction Industries declined by 10% due to lower sales volume associated with the reduction in end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories. Sales in Resource Industries decreased by 9% due to lower end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. 
I'll now move to Slide 10. Operating profit for the fourth quarter fell by 25% to $1.4 billion, mostly due to volume declines. Similar to the trend we've seen throughout the year, lower manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expense partially mitigated the decline in volume. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%. Restructuring expense for the quarter was flat at $58 million compared with $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
I'll discuss the individual segments results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11 with Construction Industries. For Construction Industries, sales decreased by 10% to $4.5 billion. Volume declines resulted from changes in dealer inventories, led by North America and lower end-user demand. We also saw lower sales in China, in part due to lower dealer inventory, which included the impact of a later Chinese New Year in 2021. However, sales to users were better than expected, and we're seeing momentum in residential construction, although we're still seeing weakness in pipeline and road construction. The segment's fourth quarter profit decreased by 4% to $630 million, driven by lower volume and higher warranty expense. That was partially offset by favorable cost absorption and lower SG&A and R&D expenses, including the absence of short-term incentive compensation. Margins remained resilient, rising 90 basis points versus 2019 to 14.0%. Versus the third quarter, margins were down slightly. This was a smaller seasonal decline than we normally see, reflecting the improvement in the top line quarter-over-quarter. 
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 9% in the fourth quarter to $2.2 billion. We experienced lower engines demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, supporting heavy construction and quarry in aggregates, and to a lesser extent, in mining. As anticipated, sales for Resource Industries improved compared with the third quarter. Despite lower sales in the fourth quarter, profit increased to $273 million compared with $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The segment's profit margin of 12.5% rose by 160 basis points compared to 2019 on strong cost controls. Variable labor and burden efficiencies as well as material costs were favorable despite the lower sales volume. SG&A and R&D expenses benefited from lower short-term incentive compensation and other cost-reduction actions, and benefits were realized from prior restructuring programs. Versus the third quarter, the operating improved by 330 basis points, mainly reflecting the higher volume. 
Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales of Energy & Transportation declined by 19% to $4.8 billion. The decline included a 29% sales decrease in oil and gas, mainly due to lower demand in North America for reciprocating engines using gas compression and well servicing. Sales were also lower for turbines and turbine-related services. Power generation sales decreased by 9%. This decline was primarily due to lower sales volume in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services and engine aftermarket parts. Transportation and industrial sales decreased by 28% and 19%, respectively. Transportation declines reflected lower locomotive deliveries and related service revenues, primarily in North America, as well as lower sales in marine. Profit for the segment decreased by 41% to $687 million due to lower sales volume. That was partially offset by lower SG&A, R&D and period manufacturing costs. The segment's operating margin declined to 14.3%, a 530 basis point decrease in comparison to a record quarter 1 year ago. Versus the third quarter, the operating margin improvement was 250 basis points reflecting the higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by the timing of product development expenses, which we mentioned in the third quarter call. 
Moving to Slide 14 to wrap up the segment commentary. Financial Products revenue decreased by $103 million or 12% to $743 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in North America. The latter reflected lower purchase receivables, which resulted from volume declines. Segment profit of $195 million declined by 7% year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher provision for credit losses and lower earning assets. While used prices were flat to up in construction equipment, we also had an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed marine and mining products. Our customers remain in good financial condition. Credit applications continued to rebound in the quarter, up 6% compared to the third quarter and up 15% compared to 1 year ago.  Cat Financials supported customers during the year with a streamlined process for loan modifications, but modification activity declined significantly, and requests for second modifications remain very limited. Past dues were 3.49%, up 35% year-over-year, but an improvement of 32 basis points from the third quarter. As has been the case, Cat Financial will continue to work closely with customers as they manage the impacts of COVID-19 on their business and cash flow, but we are pleased to see that our customers remain in good financial health. 
Now on Slide 15. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was about $1.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $200 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease reflected changes in Caterpillar inventory as our inventories remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a decrease in 2019. As we've mentioned previously, we continue to hold higher Caterpillar inventory, primarily in components and other work in process to ensure that any potential disruptions to supply do not affect our customers and to make sure we're able to respond quickly to improved demand. However, free cash flow from ME&T did increase by $800 million versus the third quarter of this year. The sequential improvement was driven largely due to the higher profit and favorable working capital. We generated $3.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in 2020. Although this was below our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion, we expect to return to our Investor Day cash targets in 2021. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.4 billion in enterprise cash and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
You will recall that we issued $2 billion in debt last year partly to increase liquidity and partly anticipation of $1.4 billion in scheduled maturities this year. Our credit ratings remain strong. We recently declared our normal quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, which translates to around $560 million. As Jim has indicated, we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. All decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year. 
Last year, including the quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases made early in the year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our intention at Investor Day was to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. And in 2020, we returned 110% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, over the past 3 years, on average, we've returned 106% and we've reduced our quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 10% since the first quarter of 2018. While share repurchases were paused in April due to uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we aim to be in the market on a regular basis. Given what we're seeing in the business, we expect to revisit the decision to pause a share repurchase program later this year. We also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we can use for compelling M&A opportunities such as our pending agreement to purchase the Weir Group's Oil & Gas business. 
Whilst we're not providing annual guidance, we do have a few thoughts on the first quarter. A summary of our key assumptions is shown on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we expect stronger year-over-year sales to users, due mainly to growth in Construction Industries. We anticipate ongoing strength in China and benefits from the pickup in residential construction in North America, although nonresidential remained subdued. We expect Resource industries, a lumpy business, to begin the year a little lower with a similar year-over-year trend to what we saw in Q4. Energy & Transportation is also expected to have a negative start of the year, although the trends are expected to improve versus the sharp drops in sales to users reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a reminder, our sales to users were only impacted marginally in the first quarter of 2020, so we expect strong good SKU growth in the remainder of 2021. We expect a normal seasonal dealer inventory build in anticipation of the spring selling season. Note that the Chinese New Year is about 3 weeks later this year. So the inventory built for Asia Pacific has shifted more to the first quarter of 2021 rather than occurring in the fourth quarter has happened between 2019 and 2020. Our aim this year is to produce closer to end-user demand and we anticipate dealers will remain within their normal range for sales -- months of sales in inventories. Again, we will benefit in 2021 from not having the headwind of the dealer inventory reductions that took place in 2020. 
With respect to operating margins, we expect a sequential improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth, even with the impact of about $225 million from restoring short-term incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis, the benefit of higher volumes will almost entirely offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation, which means we expect operating margins to be about flat versus Q1 2020. As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect to deliver margins in the Investor Day range as the benefits of operating leverage and the restructuring cost actions I mentioned earlier will offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation and high expenses that were deferred into 2021. 
Looking at margins by segment. In Construction Industries, stronger sales and leverage on higher volumes are anticipated to drive the sequential margin expansion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter despite the impact of short-term incentive compensation. Resource Industries is also anticipated to have a higher-margin sequentially on higher sales and leverage, along with favorable mix. However, from a margin perspective,  Energy & Transportation is likely to have a weaker start to the year, which is in line with typical seasonality. This excludes any impact from the Weir acquisition, which we anticipate will close very soon, although we don't expect it to be material to our full year results. 
In addition, we assume a tax rate in the first quarter of about 26% to 28%, consistent with what we project for the full year based on the current U.S. statutory tax rate. This is in line with the tax rate we have reported in 2020. We'd expect normal CapEx at a pace that would translate to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. 
So finally, let's turn to Slide 17 and let me recap today's key points. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while improving operational excellence. In the fourth quarter, trends in sales to users improved compared to the third quarter, dealer inventories declined and we improved adjusted operating margins relative to Q3. We expect to see improved margin sequentially and stronger volumes in the first quarter. We're grateful to our employees for ensuring we provided the essential products and services that enable our customers to support a world in need and most importantly, for doing so safely. With that, I'll hand it back to Jason to prepare for the Q&A session."

But just given the uncertainty around the pandemic, the rollout of the vaccine, the resulting impact on the global economy, although we expect it to be a better year, it's difficult for us to quantify how much better it will be just based on the pandemic. And we mentioned several bright spots, whether we continued strength in China, continued strength in residential activity in the United States, which drives our smaller construction business. We're generally -- continue to be bullish on mining, still some concerns around heavy construction and quarry and ag, which impact resource industries. But again, it's -- it isn't so much a concern about downside as it is uncertainty as to how much better things we'll get this year."

And given the operating leverage that we have in the business, that enables us to more than offset the STIP increase. We continue to monitor and control costs. We are in an environment where everybody is obviously focused on making sure every dollar counts. And that will continue as we go forward. That is something which will obviously continue until we start seeing stronger recoveries and obviously continue to make sure that we're investing in the business, as Jim said, we continue to invest in services.

So Jim, can you provide your thoughts on those 2 issues, particularly the second issue of the portfolio and how we should think of acquisitions, maybe help changing that investor view? I mean, especially given your net debt to EBITDA and that's on a weak 2020 EBITDA, is only 0.4. And if you can tie into that, with the percentage of aftermarket revenues you gave this morning, it does suggest your aftermarket revenues have to grow at a 9.8% CAGR from 2020 to '26 to meet your revenue goal of $28 billion in 2026 for aftermarket.

Starting with the question about our portfolio and the way we're positioned. I feel quite good about the way we're positioned. You stop and think about the potential impact on our Resource Industries business over time, particularly in mining, as the energy transition occurs, thinking about the commodities that will be required both in terms of investments in infrastructure. Electric vehicles, again, I believe we're very well positioned in our eye to take advantage of that. We also, as when you asked the question last quarter, I talked about the fact that we do intend to continue to support our customers both during and after the transition. And so I believe we're well positioned to do that. So again, we continue to work closely with our customers. We continue to invest in new products. Again, last quarter, when you asked the question, we talked about some of the things that we're doing in terms of investments with new products. And we have an all-electric switch locomotive. We've done things to help make our oil and gas customers more sustainable, whether it be an engine that allows them to substitute up to 85% natural gas substituting natural gas for diesel fuel for well servicing. We're doing things in terms of allowing oil and gas customers to reduce flaring. So again, a whole variety of things that we're doing and we're investing in to support our customers, both during and after the energy transition. In terms of your question about services, certainly, our goal is an ambitious goal, and we said that when we introduced that goal, and we certainly recognize that it is ambitious, but we're very focused on this as a business. We've been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities and our -- many of our processes in our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward. And we think that represents just an excellent opportunity for future profitable growth over the next few years."

So certainly, we're always looking across the business to find ways to improve our competitiveness to improve our footprint, to improve cost of our back-office operations. So that's a never-ending journey that we're on. But we really are growing -- attempting to grow long term, absolute OPEB dollars as opposed to just squeezing higher margins out.

And one of the things, obviously, you would normally have expected in a year where there's a downturn to see a working capital inflow this year in 2020. Obviously, because of the decision we took around inventories to make sure we held a little bit of extra inventory to buffer against supply disruption and/or demanding changes, we have -- we will be in a situation in 2021, where we don't expect a big build of inventory. So that helps our free cash flow, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our free cash flow targets in 2021. The other thing, just to remember, on the working capital and cash flow basis, is obviously, last year, in 2020, we paid about $700 million of the short-term incentive compensation. We will not have that in 2021. So that will be, again, a strong boost to our cash position as we go through the year. But the one thing I would say that to me, that has been really remarkable is to remind you again, in a year of significant turmoil where we've held sort of additional inventory, we have still been able to generate free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This is a hugely cash-generative company and one which I think sometimes investors do underappreciate."

Joining me this morning are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager. 
During our call, we'll be discussing the earnings news release that we issued earlier this morning. Our slides from today, the news release and a video recap are all in the Investors section of caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations.  
The forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. Caterpillar has a copyright of this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without a prior written approval. 
Today, we're reporting profit per share of $1.42 for the quarter and $5.46 for the year. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share of $2.12 for the fourth quarter excluded remeasurement losses of $0.63 per share resulting from the settlement of pension and other postretirement obligations. It also excluded restructuring expenses of $0.07 per share, which Andrew will discuss. 
For the full year, adjusted profit per share of $6.56 excluded $0.55 per share resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and $0.55 per share in restructuring expenses. 
We provide a GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory, backlog, services revenues and full year 2020 numbers in our slides. 
Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Jim?"

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their resilience and performance during 2020, a year of unprecedented challenges. 
The Caterpillar team continued to provide the essential products and services that enabled our customers to support society during the pandemic. In this difficult environment, we leveraged our strong safety culture and had the best year on record for employee safety. Our employees' generous contributions and volunteerism are also notable. We had a record level of support for worldwide relief efforts in 2020 through the Caterpillar Foundation.  
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I plan to briefly cover the following topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Cat's fourth quarter results. I'll then provide comments on our performance for the full year, followed by some high-level thoughts about 2021. I'll close by highlighting several ways we're advancing our strategy.  
Starting on Slide 4, I'll recap fourth quarter results versus 1 year ago. Sales and revenues of $11.2 billion decreased 15%, about as we expected. Lower sales volume drove the decline reflecting lower end-user demand and reductions in dealer inventory. Dealers decreased their inventories by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, roughly $400 million more than we expected. For the full year, dealers reduced their inventories by $2.9 billion. This positions us well to produce closer to demand in 2021, which was our goal when we introduced our enhanced S&OP process.  
Fourth quarter sales to users declined by 10% versus the previous year. Sales to users for both construction and mining equipment were better than we expected. While fourth quarter 2020 operating margins declined year-on-year, they improved by 230 basis points versus the third quarter. At 12.3%, they were better than we expected, reflecting better operational performance. Restructuring expense was lower than we expected as was the effective tax rate. Profit per share in the fourth quarter was $1.42. Adjusted profit per share was $2.12.  
Regarding our full year results on Slide 5, we said at the start of the pandemic, it would be challenging to achieve the operating margin target we communicated during our 2019 Investor Day due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and supply chain, as well as our intent to continue investing in new products and services to drive long-term profitable growth. So we're pleased that our final operating margin for 2020 was within our targeted range. We finished 2020 with sales and revenues of $41.7 billion and an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8%. 
Our ME&T free cash flow for the full year was $3.1 billion. While we did not achieve our target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion, our free cash flow performance improved as the year progressed. Our decision to hold higher Caterpillar inventory to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and to position ourselves for changes in market demand also impacted our free cash flow generation in 2020, as Andrew will discuss shortly. We remain focused on returning substantially all ME&T free cash to shareholders through the cycles, and we returned $3.4 billion or 110% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases in 2020.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide some comments on our end markets. Market conditions remain fluid due to the pandemic. However, I'll provide some thoughts based on what we see today. In Construction Industries, we see construction in North America benefiting from increased residential demand. We expect a strong selling season in China, including demand for our new GX excavator line. 
We expect continued recovery in the rest of Asia Pacific. The current shutdown in some regions of EAME may constrain construction activity in Europe in the short term. However, we expect improved market conditions due to favorable expansionary policies as well as benefits from higher commodity prices in Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia. In Latin America, we see Brazil's construction sector supportive of machine demand while weakness outside Brazil is expected to continue at least in the short term.  
Turning to Resource Industries. The improvement in mining fundamentals is expected to continue. We anticipate most mine sites to continue operating with limited disruptions and high levels of truck activity. In addition, metal prices are supportive of reinvestment and quoting activity continues to be robust. The number of parked trucks continued to decline. We continue to see strong interest in autonomy. Heavy construction and quarry and aggregate markets remain uncertain. A U.S. infrastructure bill would likely have a positive impact on these end markets.  
Moving to Energy & Transportation, we expect typical seasonality. Although we are encouraged by recent moves in oil prices, we expect oil and gas will continue to reflect conditions in that market. We expect some improvement in power generation supported by data center activity. We expect growth in industrial across all applications, and transportation should grow due to services and higher international rail activity later in the year. 
Overall, we expect our sales in 2021 to be stronger due to the lack of a dealer inventory reduction and improving market conditions, as I've described. We also expect services revenues to increase during the year.  
Given the continuing uncertainty, we're not providing earnings guidance at this time. Andrew will provide several assumptions for the first quarter in a moment, but we expect the first quarter to benefit from stronger year-over-year sales to users and dealer restocking. We also expect modestly higher margins in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.  
You may recall that during our third quarter earnings call, I said that I felt better today than I did a quarter ago, and the same is true today for the reasons I explained earlier concerning our markets. In addition, we're executing well against our strategy for long-term profitable growth. 
We expect to achieve our Investor Day operating margin targets in 2021 despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. We also expect to meet our Investor Day free cash flow targets this year. Given our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders as well as our desire to be in the market on a regular basis, we expect to revisit our current pause in share repurchases later this year.  
We have paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, all decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year.  
We signed an agreement last quarter to acquire Weir's Oil & Gas business. We see a strong fit between Weir and our current offerings. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve our existing customer base while adding services revenue opportunities. We anticipate the acquisition will close very soon.  
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. We're focused on operational excellence and continue to invest in services and expanded offerings during the pandemic. An example of our continued investment in expanded offerings was our new GX line of excavators launched in November in China, which has received a positive response from our customers. The GX series provides the durability, safety and services that customers expect, plus 15% lower fuel consumption than the prior models. It also offers 25% lower maintenance cost. 
Our technology, along with our engineering know-how and global dealer network, has always played a pivotal role in making our customers more successful with Caterpillar.  
For the first time, we displayed some of our technology at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month. We featured Cat MineStar, a suite of technology and solutions that powers our autonomous trucks. With Cat MineStar, customers say their employees are safer, machines are more efficient and operations are more consistent and productive. Customers have realized productivity increases of up to 30% with 0 reportable injuries. We believe our autonomous capabilities provide a competitive advantage in mining.  
We were recently awarded research funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for 2 development projects. The first project, which is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, is a 3-year program for a hydrogen fuel cell system for data center power. The second project is expected to launch in mid-2021 and is a 3-year program related to a flexible natural gas and hydrogen combined heat and power system.  
Caterpillar announced 2020 sustainability goals in 2006, and we're proud of our progress. By 2019, we'd reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 54% from our 2006 baseline exceeding our goal of 50%, and more than 35% of our electrical energy was obtained from renewables or alternative sources exceeding our 2020 goal of 20%. We'll disclose our final 2020 goal attainment in May when we also plan to disclose our new sustainability goals for the next horizon.  
I'll also comment on services, which is an important element of our strategy. As you know, we have a target of doubling our services revenue from 2012 to 2026. Our annual services revenue declined 13% to $16 billion in 2020 versus the prior year. As we expected, services were less cyclical than original equipment and rose as a percentage of sales, representing 41% of ME&T sales in 2020. 
Year-over-year services declines reflected the reduction in machine hours related to the pandemic and customer decisions to delay planned maintenance and rebuilds as they sought to conserve cash. However, we did see an increase in customer value agreements, both in the number and the average length. With over 1 million connected assets, we feel we have critical mass from a connectivity perspective, which will leverage to increase services sales over time.  
In the coming year, we expect to return to growth in services. We did see positive momentum from the third to the fourth quarter of 2020. All 3 segments have detailed plans to increase services by making our customers more successful.  
In summary, we continue executing our strategy, improving operational excellence and investing in expanded offerings and services to help our customers succeed. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and intend to deliver higher margins and free cash flow through the cycles, as outlined during our 2019 Investor Day. 
We're grateful for our team's accomplishments in 2020, including their high level of engagement. We have a great team and we'll emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company well positioned for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key",2751,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key assumptions for the first quarter of 2021.  
Starting with the fourth quarter on Slide 8. Versus last year, sales and revenues declined by 15% to $11.2 billion. Operating profit decreased by 25% to $1.4 billion. Good cost control in the quarter partly offset the impacts of lower volume. Fourth quarter 2020 profit per share was $1.42. That included pretax remeasurement losses of $438 million or $0.63 per share, resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement obligations. Last year's profit per share for the fourth quarter was $1.97. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share was $2.12 compared to $2.71 last year. 
You will have seen from the release that the full year effective tax rate was approximately 28%, excluding discrete items. This was lower than the 31% rate we'd anticipated and added $0.26 to profit per share. We also had a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding restructuring expense, adds another $0.07 per share. The balance of the outperformance reflect a better-than-expected operating results, which saw adjusted operating margins improve by 170 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.  
Since 2019, we have only reported adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter when we had mark-to-market impacts from our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. This change happened because restructuring expense have returned to base levels, which was between $100 million and $200 million per annum. This was not considered material and did not warrant adjusting profit per share. 
However, restructuring expenses risen to $350 million this year as we took additional actions to address certain challenged products. We also expect restructuring expense in 2021 to be similar to or even greater than the 2020 total as we continue to take the necessary actions to improve our cost competitiveness. So we're now reporting adjusted profits per share excluding restructuring charges, and we'll report adjusted profit per share each quarter in the coming year to exclude restructuring. We've also adjusted the prior year numbers, so they're on a comparable basis. Our restructuring efforts in 2020 made good progress, and we expect $150 million benefit in 2021 from these actions.  
As shown on Slide 9, overall sales and revenues finished fairly close to what we anticipated in October as stronger end-user demand was offset by further reductions in dealer inventory. The top line declined by $1.9 billion to $11.2 billion, primarily due to lower volume and a larger year-on-year reduction in dealer inventory. 
As Jim mentioned, sales to users decreased by 10% for the fourth quarter. Sales to users for construction industries declined by 1% versus the prior year. It was a mixed bag geographically as Asia Pacific rose by 16%, benefiting from stimulus spending in China. Latin America also improved up 11%. North America was down 8%, a solid improvement from the third quarter trend. 
Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, had a 3% decline for the quarter. Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 25%. The largest driver of that decline was attributed to lower levels of activity in oil and gas.  
Between earning calls, we've been reporting rolling 3-month sales to users every month. Going forward, we will report to sales to users only once per quarter when we discuss earnings so we can put them in the proper context.  
Machine orders improved in the fourth quarter as dealers began preparing for the spring selling season and the Chinese New Year. Machine orders accelerated by the double-digit percentage terms from the fourth -- third quarter to the fourth, in line with normal trends. 
Dealers decreased inventories by $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. That compares with a decrease of $700 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Improving sales to users enabled dealers to reduce their inventory by about $400 million more than we had anticipated in October. Dealers reduced inventory over the course of 2020 by $2.9 billion. This change brought their inventory levels to the lower end of their normal range for months of sales. As you know, dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions on inventory.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we finished the rollout of our new S&OP process which we believe promoted better alignment between us and our dealers through a volatile year. This dealer inventory reduction positions us well for 2021.  
Reported sales decreased versus the prior year in all 3 primary segments. Energy & Transportation contributed the majority of the decrease in total sales, declining by 19%. This segment had weakness in all 4 applications, led by oil and gas and transportation. Sales in Construction Industries declined by 10% due to lower sales volume associated with the reduction in end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories. Sales in Resource Industries decreased by 9% due to lower end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts.  
I'll now move to Slide 10. Operating profit for the fourth quarter fell by 25% to $1.4 billion, mostly due to volume declines. Similar to the trend we've seen throughout the year, lower manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expense partially mitigated the decline in volume. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%. Restructuring expense for the quarter was flat at $58 million compared with $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
I'll discuss the individual segments results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11 with Construction Industries. For Construction Industries, sales decreased by 10% to $4.5 billion. Volume declines resulted from changes in dealer inventories, led by North America, and lower end-user demand. We also saw lower sales in China, in part due to lower dealer inventory, which included the impact of a later Chinese New Year in 2021. However, sales to users were better than expected, and we're seeing momentum in residential construction, although we're still seeing weakness in pipeline and road construction. 
The segment's fourth quarter profit decreased by 4% to $630 million, driven by lower volume and higher warranty expense. That was partially offset by favorable cost absorption and lower SG&A and R&D expenses, including the absence of short-term incentive compensation. Margins remained resilient, rising 90 basis points versus 2019 to 14.0%. Versus the third quarter, margins were down slightly. This was a smaller seasonal decline than we normally see, reflecting the improvement in the top line quarter-over-quarter.  
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 9% in the fourth quarter to $2.2 billion. We experienced lower engines demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, supporting heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, and to a lesser extent, in mining. As anticipated, sales for Resource Industries improved compared with the third quarter. 
Despite lower sales in the fourth quarter, profit increased to $273 million compared with $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The segment's profit margin of 12.5% rose by 160 basis points compared to 2019 on strong cost controls. Variable labor and burden efficiencies as well as material costs were favorable despite the lower sales volume. SG&A and R&D expenses benefited from lower short-term incentive compensation and other cost-reduction actions, and benefits were realized from prior restructuring programs. Versus the third quarter, the operating improved by 330 basis points, mainly reflecting the higher volume.  
Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales of Energy & Transportation declined by 19% to $4.8 billion. The decline included a 29% sales decrease in oil and gas, mainly due to lower demand in North America for reciprocating engines using gas compression and well servicing. Sales were also lower for turbines and turbine-related services. Power generation sales decreased by 9%. This decline was primarily due to lower sales volume in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services and engine aftermarket parts. 
Transportation and industrial sales decreased by 28% and 19%, respectively. Transportation declines reflected lower locomotive deliveries and related service revenues primarily in North America, as well as lower sales in marine. Profit for the segment decreased by 41% to $687 million due to lower sales volume. That was partially offset by lower SG&A, R&D and period manufacturing costs. 
The segment's operating margin declined to 14.3%, a 530 basis point decrease in comparison to a record quarter a year ago. Versus the third quarter, the operating margin improvement was 250 basis points reflecting the higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by the timing of product development expenses, which we mentioned in the third quarter call.  
Moving to Slide 14 to wrap up the segment commentary. Financial Products revenue decreased by $103 million or 12% to $743 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in North America. The latter reflected lower purchase receivables, which resulted from volume declines. 
Segment profit of $195 million declined by 7% year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher provision for credit losses and lower earning assets. While used prices were flat to up in construction equipment, we also had an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed marine and mining products. 
Our customers remain in good financial condition. Credit applications continued to rebound in the quarter, up 6% compared to the third quarter and up 15% compared to a year ago. Cat Financials supported customers during the year with a streamlined process for loan modifications, but modification activity declined significantly and requests for second modifications remain very limited. 
Past dues were 3.49%, up 35% year-over-year, but an improvement of 32 basis points from the third quarter. As has been the case, Cat Financial will continue to work closely with customers as they manage the impacts of COVID-19 on their business and cash flow, but we are pleased to see that our customers remain in good financial health. 
Now on Slide 15. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was about $1.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $200 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease reflected changes in Caterpillar inventory as our inventories remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a decrease in 2019. As we've mentioned previously, we continue to hold higher Caterpillar inventory, primarily in components and other work in process to ensure that any potential disruptions to supply do not affect our customers and to make sure we're able to respond quickly to improved demand. 
However, free cash flow from ME&T did increase by $800 million versus the third quarter of this year. The sequential improvement was largely due to the higher profit and favorable working capital. We generated $3.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in 2020. Although this was below our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion, we expect to return to our Investor Day cash targets in 2021. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.4 billion in enterprise cash and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
You will recall that we issued $2 billion in debt last year partly to increase liquidity and partly anticipation of $1.4 billion in scheduled maturities this year. Our credit ratings remain strong. We recently declared our normal quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, which translates to around $560 million. As Jim has indicated, we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. All decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year. 
Last year, including the quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases made early in the year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our intention at Investor Day was to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. And in 2020, we returned 110% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, over the past 3 years, on average, we've returned 106% and we've reduced our quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 10% since the first quarter of 2018. 
While share repurchases were paused in April due to uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we aim to be in the market on a regular basis. Given what we're seeing in the business, we expect to revisit the decision to pause our share repurchase program later this year. We also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we can use for compelling M&A opportunities such as our pending agreement to purchase the Weir Group's Oil & Gas business. 
Whilst we're not providing annual guidance, we do have a few thoughts on the first quarter. A summary of our key assumptions is shown on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we expect stronger year-over-year sales to users, due mainly to growth in Construction Industries. We anticipate ongoing strength in China and benefits from the pickup in residential construction in North America, although nonresidential remained subdued. 
We expect Resource Industries, a lumpy business, to begin the year a little lower with a similar year-over-year STU trend to what we saw in Q4. Energy & Transportation is also expected to have a negative start to the year, although the trends are expected to improve versus the sharp drops in sales to users reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a reminder, our sales to users were only impacted marginally in the first quarter of 2020, so we expect stronger STU growth in the remainder of 2021. 
We expect a normal seasonal dealer inventory build in anticipation of the spring selling season. Note that the Chinese New Year is about 3 weeks later this year. So the inventory built for Asia Pacific has shifted more to the first quarter of 2021 rather than occurring in the fourth quarter has happened between 2019 and 2020. 
Our aim this year is to produce closer to end-user demand and we anticipate dealers will remain within their normal range for sales -- months of sales in inventories. Again, we will benefit in 2021 from not having the headwind of the dealer inventory reductions that took place in 2020. 
With respect to operating margins, we expect a sequential improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth, even with the impact of about $225 million from restoring short-term incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis, the benefit of higher volumes will almost entirely offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation, which means we expect operating margins to be about flat versus Q1 2020. 
As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect to deliver margins in the Investor Day range as the benefits of operating leverage and the restructuring cost actions I mentioned earlier will offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation and high expenses that were deferred into 2021. 
Looking at margins by segment. In Construction Industries, stronger sales and leverage on higher volumes are anticipated to drive the sequential margin expansion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter despite the impact of short-term incentive compensation. Resource Industries is also anticipated to have a higher-margin sequentially on higher sales and leverage, along with favorable mix. 
However, from a margin perspective, Energy & Transportation is likely to have a weaker start to the year, which is in line with typical seasonality. This excludes any impact from the Weir acquisition, which we anticipate will close very soon, although we don't expect it to be material to our full year results. 
In addition, we assume a tax rate in the first quarter of about 26% to 28%, consistent with what we project for the full year based on the current U.S. statutory tax rate. This is in line with the tax rate we have reported in 2020. We'd expect normal CapEx at a pace that would translate to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. 
So finally, let's turn to Slide 17 and let me recap today's key points. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while improving operational excellence. In the fourth quarter, trends in sales to users improved compared to the third quarter, dealer inventories declined and we improved adjusted operating margins relative to Q3. 
We expect to see improved margin sequentially and stronger volumes in the first quarter. We're grateful to our employees for ensuring we provided the essential products and services that enable our customers to support a world in need, and then most importantly for doing so safely. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Jason to prepare for the Q&A session."

So Jim, can you provide your thoughts on those 2 issues, particularly the second issue of the portfolio and how we should think of acquisitions, maybe help changing that investor view? I mean, especially given your net debt to EBITDA and that's on a weak 2020 EBITDA, is only 0.4.

So if you can talk to those issues, it would be helpful as people think about the whole cycle."

Starting with the question about our portfolio and the way we're positioned. I feel quite good about the way we're positioned.

We also, as when you asked the question last quarter, I talked about the fact that we do intend to continue to support our customers both during and after the transition. And so I believe we're well positioned to do that. So again, we continue to work closely with our customers. We continue to invest in new products. 
Again, last quarter, when you asked the question, we talked about some of the things that we're doing in terms of investments with new products. And we have an all-electric switch locomotive. We've done things to help make our oil and gas customers more sustainable, whether it be an engine that allows them to substitute up to 85% natural gas -- substituting natural gas for diesel fuel for well servicing. We're doing things in terms of allowing oil and gas customers to reduce flaring. So again, a whole variety of things that we're doing and we're investing in to support our customers, both during and after the energy transition. 
In terms of your question about services, certainly, our goal is an ambitious goal, and we said that when we introduced that goal, and we certainly recognize that it is ambitious, but we're very focused on this as a business. We've been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities and our -- many of our processes in our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward.

And I'm wondering if you've got portions where you're outright trying to either reduce capacity or take out footprint, maybe that goes back to David's question on your -- on some of your businesses that maybe have some more structural concerns long term."

So again, as I mentioned earlier, we are continually looking for ways to improve our competitiveness and reduce our cost structure. That means evaluating not just our capacity but also our footprint and where we are. We previously publicly announced the decision to close the Dortmund and Luenen and Wuppertal operations to get -- to move closer to our customers and also to reduce costs. 
So again, in my view, that needs to be something that we continually do. And it isn't just our factories in brick-and-mortar, it's also looking at our back-office operations as well. And again, always finding ways to improve our cost structure and be more competitive. So really, the restructuring that we put in, again, is more reflective of our continuous journey to improve our competitiveness."

As I said in my remarks, when we get to a base level, which is between $100 million and $200 million, it is effectively at a level where it's not material and therefore it doesn't warrant us adjusting profit per share for that. Given the size of the spend, the magnitude of the spend, $354 million, and as we say we expect a similar level, maybe slightly higher in 2021, that does require us to be consistent with where we've been in historic periods. And therefore, do exclude it. 
I know it's a -- it causes you guys some challenge in because you have to go back and restate your models. But unfortunately, it is one of those things which, from a disclosure perspective, is a good practice for us to do. As regards what the spend is, obviously, some of the spend will be ongoing programs, as Jim mentioned. But some of those programs actually do have -- or are multiyear program, they're not just a single year, and so some of that spend does recur. So obviously, we're not doing a big restructuring program. We're not announcing anything, which comes to your question about -- on some of the -- back to the questions about are there more structural long-term concerns. This is just really about tweaking, making sure we're doing the right thing to drive our cost base."

As you see mining RFP activity coming back and customer engagement growing, can you talk about sort of growth trends and potential share gains for autonomous offerings?

We do continue to see a strong pull for automation and autonomy by our mining customers. And again, we believe it delivers tremendous value. We've had customers say publicly that they are seeing productivity increases of 30% against their best man sites. Again, it's got a safety component for them as well. That helps improve the utilization of their equipment, which is so important. 
And we do feel strongly that we have a competitive advantage with our autonomous solution. And generally, it requires a certain size in terms of a mine in terms of number of trucks for the capital investment to make sense, but we're continually working on that as well. So there's a lot of opportunity going forward in mining with autonomy. 
And you make a very good point. Now we are starting to deploy some of those technologies. We have a lot of programs in work to deploy a lot of that technology, whether it's autonomy, semi-autonomy, remote control, many of those same kinds of technologies into Construction Industries. And it isn't one size fits all, it happens over time. But again, we do believe there's applicability of many of those technologies to our construction business over time.

Obviously, because of the decision we took around inventories to make sure we held a little bit of extra inventory to buffer against supply disruption and/or demanding changes, we have -- we will be in a situation in 2021, where we don't expect a big build of inventory. So that helps our free cash flow, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our free cash flow targets in 2021. 
The other thing just to remember, on the working capital and cash flow basis, is obviously, last year, in 2020, we paid about $700 million of short-term incentive compensation. We will not have that in 2021. So that will be, again, a strong boost to our cash position as we go through the year. But the one thing I would say that to me, that has been really remarkable is to remind you again in a year of significant turmoil where we've held sort of additional inventory, we have still been able to generate free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This is a hugely cash-generative company and one which I think sometimes investors do underappreciate."

During our call, we'll be discussing the earnings news release that we issued earlier this morning. Our slides from today, the news release and a video recap are all in the Investors section of caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations.  
The forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. Caterpillar has a copyright of this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without a prior written approval. 
Today, we're reporting profit per share of $1.42 for the quarter and $5.46 for the year. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share of $2.12 for the fourth quarter excluded remeasurement losses of $0.63 per share resulting from the settlement of pension and other postretirement obligations. It also excluded restructuring expenses of $0.07 per share, which Andrew will discuss. 
For the full year, adjusted profit per share of $6.56 excluded $0.55 per share resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and $0.55 per share in restructuring expenses. 
We provide a GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory, backlog, services revenues and full year 2020 numbers in our slides. 
Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Jim?"

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their resilience and performance during 2020, a year of unprecedented challenges. 
The Caterpillar team continued to provide the essential products and services that enabled our customers to support society during the pandemic. In this difficult environment, we leveraged our strong safety culture and had the best year on record for employee safety. Our employees' generous contributions and volunteerism are also notable. We had a record level of support for worldwide relief efforts in 2020 through the Caterpillar Foundation.  
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I plan to briefly cover the following topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Cat's fourth quarter results. I'll then provide comments on our performance for the full year, followed by some high-level thoughts about 2021. I'll close by highlighting several ways we're advancing our strategy.  
Starting on Slide 4, I'll recap fourth quarter results versus 1 year ago. Sales and revenues of $11.2 billion decreased 15%, about as we expected. Lower sales volume drove the decline reflecting lower end-user demand and reductions in dealer inventory. Dealers decreased their inventories by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, roughly $400 million more than we expected. For the full year, dealers reduced their inventories by $2.9 billion. This positions us well to produce closer to demand in 2021, which was our goal when we introduced our enhanced S&OP process.  
Fourth quarter sales to users declined by 10% versus the previous year. Sales to users for both construction and mining equipment were better than we expected. While fourth quarter 2020 operating margins declined year-on-year, they improved by 230 basis points versus the third quarter. At 12.3%, they were better than we expected, reflecting better operational performance. Restructuring expense was lower than we expected as was the effective tax rate. Profit per share in the fourth quarter was $1.42. Adjusted profit per share was $2.12.  
Regarding our full year results on Slide 5, we said at the start of the pandemic, it would be challenging to achieve the operating margin target we communicated during our 2019 Investor Day due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and supply chain, as well as our intent to continue investing in new products and services to drive long-term profitable growth. So we're pleased that our final operating margin for 2020 was within our targeted range. We finished 2020 with sales and revenues of $41.7 billion and an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8%. 
Our ME&T free cash flow for the full year was $3.1 billion. While we did not achieve our target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion, our free cash flow performance improved as the year progressed. Our decision to hold higher Caterpillar inventory to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and to position ourselves for changes in market demand also impacted our free cash flow generation in 2020, as Andrew will discuss shortly. We remain focused on returning substantially all ME&T free cash to shareholders through the cycles, and we returned $3.4 billion or 110% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases in 2020.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide some comments on our end markets. Market conditions remain fluid due to the pandemic. However, I'll provide some thoughts based on what we see today. In Construction Industries, we see construction in North America benefiting from increased residential demand. We expect a strong selling season in China, including demand for our new GX excavator line. 
We expect continued recovery in the rest of Asia Pacific. The current shutdown in some regions of EAME may constrain construction activity in Europe in the short term. However, we expect improved market conditions due to favorable expansionary policies as well as benefits from higher commodity prices in Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia. In Latin America, we see Brazil's construction sector supportive of machine demand while weakness outside Brazil is expected to continue at least in the short term.  
Turning to Resource Industries. The improvement in mining fundamentals is expected to continue. We anticipate most mine sites to continue operating with limited disruptions and high levels of truck activity. In addition, metal prices are supportive of reinvestment and quoting activity continues to be robust. The number of parked trucks continued to decline. We continue to see strong interest in autonomy. Heavy construction and quarry and aggregate markets remain uncertain. A U.S. infrastructure bill would likely have a positive impact on these end markets.  
Moving to Energy & Transportation, we expect typical seasonality. Although we are encouraged by recent moves in oil prices, we expect oil and gas will continue to reflect conditions in that market. We expect some improvement in power generation supported by data center activity. We expect growth in industrial across all applications, and transportation should grow due to services and higher international rail activity later in the year. 
Overall, we expect our sales in 2021 to be stronger due to the lack of a dealer inventory reduction and improving market conditions, as I've described. We also expect services revenues to increase during the year.  
Given the continuing uncertainty, we're not providing earnings guidance at this time. Andrew will provide several assumptions for the first quarter in a moment, but we expect the first quarter to benefit from stronger year-over-year sales to users and dealer restocking. We also expect modestly higher margins in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.  
You may recall that during our third quarter earnings call, I said that I felt better today than I did a quarter ago, and the same is true today for the reasons I explained earlier concerning our markets. In addition, we're executing well against our strategy for long-term profitable growth. 
We expect to achieve our Investor Day operating margin targets in 2021 despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. We also expect to meet our Investor Day free cash flow targets this year. Given our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders as well as our desire to be in the market on a regular basis, we expect to revisit our current pause in share repurchases later this year.  
We have paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, all decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year.  
We signed an agreement last quarter to acquire Weir's Oil & Gas business. We see a strong fit between Weir and our current offerings. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve our existing customer base while adding services revenue opportunities. We anticipate the acquisition will close very soon.  
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. We're focused on operational excellence and continue to invest in services and expanded offerings during the pandemic. An example of our continued investment in expanded offerings was our new GX line of excavators launched in November in China, which has received a positive response from our customers. The GX series provides the durability, safety and services that customers expect, plus 15% lower fuel consumption than the prior models. It also offers 25% lower maintenance cost. 
Our technology, along with our engineering know-how and global dealer network, has always played a pivotal role in making our customers more successful with Caterpillar.  
For the first time, we displayed some of our technology at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month. We featured Cat MineStar, a suite of technology and solutions that powers our autonomous trucks. With Cat MineStar, customers say their employees are safer, machines are more efficient and operations are more consistent and productive. Customers have realized productivity increases of up to 30% with 0 reportable injuries. We believe our autonomous capabilities provide a competitive advantage in mining.  
We were recently awarded research funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for 2 development projects. The first project, which is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, is a 3-year program for a hydrogen fuel cell system for data center power. The second project is expected to launch in mid-2021 and is a 3-year program related to a flexible natural gas and hydrogen combined heat and power system.  
Caterpillar announced 2020 sustainability goals in 2006, and we're proud of our progress. By 2019, we'd reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 54% from our 2006 baseline exceeding our goal of 50%, and more than 35% of our electrical energy was obtained from renewables or alternative sources exceeding our 2020 goal of 20%. We'll disclose our final 2020 goal attainment in May when we also plan to disclose our new sustainability goals for the next horizon.  
I'll also comment on services, which is an important element of our strategy. As you know, we have a target of doubling our services revenue from 2012 to 2026. Our annual services revenue declined 13% to $16 billion in 2020 versus the prior year. As we expected, services were less cyclical than original equipment and rose as a percentage of sales, representing 41% of ME&T sales in 2020. 
Year-over-year services declines reflected the reduction in machine hours related to the pandemic and customer decisions to delay planned maintenance and rebuilds as they sought to conserve cash. However, we did see an increase in customer value agreements, both in the number and the average length. With over 1 million connected assets, we feel we have critical mass from a connectivity perspective, which will leverage to increase services sales over time.  
In the coming year, we expect to return to growth in services. We did see positive momentum from the third to the fourth quarter of 2020. All 3 segments have detailed plans to increase services by making our customers more successful.  
In summary, we continue executing our strategy, improving operational excellence and investing in expanded offerings and services to help our customers succeed. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and intend to deliver higher margins and free cash flow through the cycles, as outlined during our 2019 Investor Day. 
We're grateful for our team's accomplishments in 2020, including their high level of engagement. We have a great team and we'll emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company well positioned for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key",2751,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key assumptions for the first quarter of 2021.  
Starting with the fourth quarter on Slide 8. Versus last year, sales and revenues declined by 15% to $11.2 billion. Operating profit decreased by 25% to $1.4 billion. Good cost control in the quarter partly offset the impacts of lower volume. Fourth quarter 2020 profit per share was $1.42. That included pretax remeasurement losses of $438 million or $0.63 per share, resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement obligations. Last year's profit per share for the fourth quarter was $1.97. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share was $2.12 compared to $2.71 last year. 
You will have seen from the release that the full year effective tax rate was approximately 28%, excluding discrete items. This was lower than the 31% rate we'd anticipated and added $0.26 to profit per share. We also had a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding restructuring expense, adds another $0.07 per share. The balance of the outperformance reflect a better-than-expected operating results, which saw adjusted operating margins improve by 170 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.  
Since 2019, we have only reported adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter when we had mark-to-market impacts from our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. This change happened because restructuring expense have returned to base levels, which was between $100 million and $200 million per annum. This was not considered material and did not warrant adjusting profit per share. 
However, restructuring expenses risen to $350 million this year as we took additional actions to address certain challenged products. We also expect restructuring expense in 2021 to be similar to or even greater than the 2020 total as we continue to take the necessary actions to improve our cost competitiveness. So we're now reporting adjusted profits per share excluding restructuring charges, and we'll report adjusted profit per share each quarter in the coming year to exclude restructuring. We've also adjusted the prior year numbers, so they're on a comparable basis. Our restructuring efforts in 2020 made good progress, and we expect $150 million benefit in 2021 from these actions.  
As shown on Slide 9, overall sales and revenues finished fairly close to what we anticipated in October as stronger end-user demand was offset by further reductions in dealer inventory. The top line declined by $1.9 billion to $11.2 billion, primarily due to lower volume and a larger year-on-year reduction in dealer inventory. 
As Jim mentioned, sales to users decreased by 10% for the fourth quarter. Sales to users for construction industries declined by 1% versus the prior year. It was a mixed bag geographically as Asia Pacific rose by 16%, benefiting from stimulus spending in China. Latin America also improved up 11%. North America was down 8%, a solid improvement from the third quarter trend. 
Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, had a 3% decline for the quarter. Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 25%. The largest driver of that decline was attributed to lower levels of activity in oil and gas.  
Between earning calls, we've been reporting rolling 3-month sales to users every month. Going forward, we will report to sales to users only once per quarter when we discuss earnings so we can put them in the proper context.  
Machine orders improved in the fourth quarter as dealers began preparing for the spring selling season and the Chinese New Year. Machine orders accelerated by the double-digit percentage terms from the fourth -- third quarter to the fourth, in line with normal trends. 
Dealers decreased inventories by $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. That compares with a decrease of $700 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Improving sales to users enabled dealers to reduce their inventory by about $400 million more than we had anticipated in October. Dealers reduced inventory over the course of 2020 by $2.9 billion. This change brought their inventory levels to the lower end of their normal range for months of sales. As you know, dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions on inventory.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we finished the rollout of our new S&OP process which we believe promoted better alignment between us and our dealers through a volatile year. This dealer inventory reduction positions us well for 2021.  
Reported sales decreased versus the prior year in all 3 primary segments. Energy & Transportation contributed the majority of the decrease in total sales, declining by 19%. This segment had weakness in all 4 applications, led by oil and gas and transportation. Sales in Construction Industries declined by 10% due to lower sales volume associated with the reduction in end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories. Sales in Resource Industries decreased by 9% due to lower end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts.  
I'll now move to Slide 10. Operating profit for the fourth quarter fell by 25% to $1.4 billion, mostly due to volume declines. Similar to the trend we've seen throughout the year, lower manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expense partially mitigated the decline in volume. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%. Restructuring expense for the quarter was flat at $58 million compared with $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
I'll discuss the individual segments results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11 with Construction Industries. For Construction Industries, sales decreased by 10% to $4.5 billion. Volume declines resulted from changes in dealer inventories, led by North America, and lower end-user demand. We also saw lower sales in China, in part due to lower dealer inventory, which included the impact of a later Chinese New Year in 2021. However, sales to users were better than expected, and we're seeing momentum in residential construction, although we're still seeing weakness in pipeline and road construction. 
The segment's fourth quarter profit decreased by 4% to $630 million, driven by lower volume and higher warranty expense. That was partially offset by favorable cost absorption and lower SG&A and R&D expenses, including the absence of short-term incentive compensation. Margins remained resilient, rising 90 basis points versus 2019 to 14.0%. Versus the third quarter, margins were down slightly. This was a smaller seasonal decline than we normally see, reflecting the improvement in the top line quarter-over-quarter.  
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 9% in the fourth quarter to $2.2 billion. We experienced lower engines demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, supporting heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, and to a lesser extent, in mining. As anticipated, sales for Resource Industries improved compared with the third quarter. 
Despite lower sales in the fourth quarter, profit increased to $273 million compared with $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The segment's profit margin of 12.5% rose by 160 basis points compared to 2019 on strong cost controls. Variable labor and burden efficiencies as well as material costs were favorable despite the lower sales volume. SG&A and R&D expenses benefited from lower short-term incentive compensation and other cost-reduction actions, and benefits were realized from prior restructuring programs. Versus the third quarter, the operating improved by 330 basis points, mainly reflecting the higher volume.  
Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales of Energy & Transportation declined by 19% to $4.8 billion. The decline included a 29% sales decrease in oil and gas, mainly due to lower demand in North America for reciprocating engines using gas compression and well servicing. Sales were also lower for turbines and turbine-related services. Power generation sales decreased by 9%. This decline was primarily due to lower sales volume in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services and engine aftermarket parts. 
Transportation and industrial sales decreased by 28% and 19%, respectively. Transportation declines reflected lower locomotive deliveries and related service revenues primarily in North America, as well as lower sales in marine. Profit for the segment decreased by 41% to $687 million due to lower sales volume. That was partially offset by lower SG&A, R&D and period manufacturing costs. 
The segment's operating margin declined to 14.3%, a 530 basis point decrease in comparison to a record quarter a year ago. Versus the third quarter, the operating margin improvement was 250 basis points reflecting the higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by the timing of product development expenses, which we mentioned in the third quarter call.  
Moving to Slide 14 to wrap up the segment commentary. Financial Products revenue decreased by $103 million or 12% to $743 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in North America. The latter reflected lower purchase receivables, which resulted from volume declines. 
Segment profit of $195 million declined by 7% year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher provision for credit losses and lower earning assets. While used prices were flat to up in construction equipment, we also had an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed marine and mining products. 
Our customers remain in good financial condition. Credit applications continued to rebound in the quarter, up 6% compared to the third quarter and up 15% compared to a year ago. Cat Financials supported customers during the year with a streamlined process for loan modifications, but modification activity declined significantly and requests for second modifications remain very limited. 
Past dues were 3.49%, up 35% year-over-year, but an improvement of 32 basis points from the third quarter. As has been the case, Cat Financial will continue to work closely with customers as they manage the impacts of COVID-19 on their business and cash flow, but we are pleased to see that our customers remain in good financial health. 
Now on Slide 15. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was about $1.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $200 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease reflected changes in Caterpillar inventory as our inventories remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a decrease in 2019. As we've mentioned previously, we continue to hold higher Caterpillar inventory, primarily in components and other work in process to ensure that any potential disruptions to supply do not affect our customers and to make sure we're able to respond quickly to improved demand. 
However, free cash flow from ME&T did increase by $800 million versus the third quarter of this year. The sequential improvement was largely due to the higher profit and favorable working capital. We generated $3.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in 2020. Although this was below our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion, we expect to return to our Investor Day cash targets in 2021. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.4 billion in enterprise cash and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
You will recall that we issued $2 billion in debt last year partly to increase liquidity and partly anticipation of $1.4 billion in scheduled maturities this year. Our credit ratings remain strong. We recently declared our normal quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, which translates to around $560 million. As Jim has indicated, we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. All decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year. 
Last year, including the quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases made early in the year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our intention at Investor Day was to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. And in 2020, we returned 110% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, over the past 3 years, on average, we've returned 106% and we've reduced our quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 10% since the first quarter of 2018. 
While share repurchases were paused in April due to uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we aim to be in the market on a regular basis. Given what we're seeing in the business, we expect to revisit the decision to pause our share repurchase program later this year. We also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we can use for compelling M&A opportunities such as our pending agreement to purchase the Weir Group's Oil & Gas business. 
Whilst we're not providing annual guidance, we do have a few thoughts on the first quarter. A summary of our key assumptions is shown on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we expect stronger year-over-year sales to users, due mainly to growth in Construction Industries. We anticipate ongoing strength in China and benefits from the pickup in residential construction in North America, although nonresidential remained subdued. 
We expect Resource Industries, a lumpy business, to begin the year a little lower with a similar year-over-year STU trend to what we saw in Q4. Energy & Transportation is also expected to have a negative start to the year, although the trends are expected to improve versus the sharp drops in sales to users reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a reminder, our sales to users were only impacted marginally in the first quarter of 2020, so we expect stronger STU growth in the remainder of 2021. 
We expect a normal seasonal dealer inventory build in anticipation of the spring selling season. Note that the Chinese New Year is about 3 weeks later this year. So the inventory built for Asia Pacific has shifted more to the first quarter of 2021 rather than occurring in the fourth quarter has happened between 2019 and 2020. 
Our aim this year is to produce closer to end-user demand and we anticipate dealers will remain within their normal range for sales -- months of sales in inventories. Again, we will benefit in 2021 from not having the headwind of the dealer inventory reductions that took place in 2020. 
With respect to operating margins, we expect a sequential improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth, even with the impact of about $225 million from restoring short-term incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis, the benefit of higher volumes will almost entirely offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation, which means we expect operating margins to be about flat versus Q1 2020. 
As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect to deliver margins in the Investor Day range as the benefits of operating leverage and the restructuring cost actions I mentioned earlier will offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation and high expenses that were deferred into 2021. 
Looking at margins by segment. In Construction Industries, stronger sales and leverage on higher volumes are anticipated to drive the sequential margin expansion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter despite the impact of short-term incentive compensation. Resource Industries is also anticipated to have a higher-margin sequentially on higher sales and leverage, along with favorable mix. 
However, from a margin perspective, Energy & Transportation is likely to have a weaker start to the year, which is in line with typical seasonality. This excludes any impact from the Weir acquisition, which we anticipate will close very soon, although we don't expect it to be material to our full year results. 
In addition, we assume a tax rate in the first quarter of about 26% to 28%, consistent with what we project for the full year based on the current U.S. statutory tax rate. This is in line with the tax rate we have reported in 2020. We'd expect normal CapEx at a pace that would translate to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. 
So finally, let's turn to Slide 17 and let me recap today's key points. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while improving operational excellence. In the fourth quarter, trends in sales to users improved compared to the third quarter, dealer inventories declined and we improved adjusted operating margins relative to Q3. 
We expect to see improved margin sequentially and stronger volumes in the first quarter. We're grateful to our employees for ensuring we provided the essential products and services that enable our customers to support a world in need, and then most importantly for doing so safely. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Jason to prepare for the Q&A session."

So Jim, can you provide your thoughts on those 2 issues, particularly the second issue of the portfolio and how we should think of acquisitions, maybe help changing that investor view? I mean, especially given your net debt to EBITDA and that's on a weak 2020 EBITDA, is only 0.4. And if you can tie into that, with the percentage of aftermarket revenues you gave this morning, it does suggest your aftermarket revenues have to grow at a 9.8% CAGR from 2020 to '26 to meet your revenue goal of $28 billion in 2026 for aftermarket. So if you can talk to those issues, it would be helpful as people think about the whole cycle."

Starting with the question about our portfolio and the way we're positioned. I feel quite good about the way we're positioned.

We also, as when you asked the question last quarter, I talked about the fact that we do intend to continue to support our customers both during and after the transition. And so I believe we're well positioned to do that. So again, we continue to work closely with our customers. We continue to invest in new products. 
Again, last quarter, when you asked the question, we talked about some of the things that we're doing in terms of investments with new products. And we have an all-electric switch locomotive. We've done things to help make our oil and gas customers more sustainable, whether it be an engine that allows them to substitute up to 85% natural gas -- substituting natural gas for diesel fuel for well servicing. We're doing things in terms of allowing oil and gas customers to reduce flaring. So again, a whole variety of things that we're doing and we're investing in to support our customers, both during and after the energy transition. 
In terms of your question about services, certainly, our goal is an ambitious goal, and we said that when we introduced that goal, and we certainly recognize that it is ambitious, but we're very focused on this as a business. We've been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities and our -- many of our processes in our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward.

So again, as we look at our autonomous solution, we believe we have a competitive advantage there. And we expect strong activity in new equipment. We expect strong activity in parts.

So again, in my view, that needs to be something that we continually do. And it isn't just our factories in brick-and-mortar, it's also looking at our back-office operations as well. And again, always finding ways to improve our cost structure and be more competitive. So really, the restructuring that we put in, again, is more reflective of our continuous journey to improve our competitiveness."

As I said in my remarks, when we get to a base level, which is between $100 million and $200 million, it is effectively at a level where it's not material and therefore it doesn't warrant us adjusting profit per share for that. Given the size of the spend, the magnitude of the spend, $354 million, and as we say we expect a similar level, maybe slightly higher in 2021, that does require us to be consistent with where we've been in historic periods. And therefore, do exclude it. 
I know it's a -- it causes you guys some challenge in because you have to go back and restate your models. But unfortunately, it is one of those things which, from a disclosure perspective, is a good practice for us to do. As regards what the spend is, obviously, some of the spend will be ongoing programs, as Jim mentioned. But some of those programs actually do have -- or are multiyear program, they're not just a single year, and so some of that spend does recur. So obviously, we're not doing a big restructuring program. We're not announcing anything, which comes to your question about -- on some of the -- back to the questions about are there more structural long-term concerns.

As you see mining RFP activity coming back and customer engagement growing, can you talk about sort of growth trends and potential share gains for autonomous offerings?

We do continue to see a strong pull for automation and autonomy by our mining customers. And again, we believe it delivers tremendous value. We've had customers say publicly that they are seeing productivity increases of 30% against their best man sites. Again, it's got a safety component for them as well. That helps improve the utilization of their equipment, which is so important. 
And we do feel strongly that we have a competitive advantage with our autonomous solution. And generally, it requires a certain size in terms of a mine in terms of number of trucks for the capital investment to make sense, but we're continually working on that as well. So there's a lot of opportunity going forward in mining with autonomy. 
And you make a very good point. Now we are starting to deploy some of those technologies. We have a lot of programs in work to deploy a lot of that technology, whether it's autonomy, semi-autonomy, remote control, many of those same kinds of technologies into Construction Industries. And it isn't one size fits all, it happens over time. But again, we do believe there's applicability of many of those technologies to our construction business over time.

So that helps our free cash flow, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our free cash flow targets in 2021. 
The other thing just to remember, on the working capital and cash flow basis, is obviously, last year, in 2020, we paid about $700 million of short-term incentive compensation. We will not have that in 2021. So that will be, again, a strong boost to our cash position as we go through the year. But the one thing I would say that to me, that has been really remarkable is to remind you again in a year of significant turmoil where we've held sort of additional inventory, we have still been able to generate free cash flow of $3.1 billion.

During our call, we'll be discussing the earnings news release that we issued earlier this morning. Our slides from today, the news release and a video recap are all in the Investors section of caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations.  
The forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. Caterpillar has a copyright of this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without a prior written approval. 
Today, we're reporting profit per share of $1.42 for the quarter and $5.46 for the year. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share of $2.12 for the fourth quarter excluded remeasurement losses of $0.63 per share resulting from the settlement of pension and other postretirement obligations. It also excluded restructuring expenses of $0.07 per share, which Andrew will discuss. 
For the full year, adjusted profit per share of $6.56 excluded $0.55 per share resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and $0.55 per share in restructuring expenses. 
We provide a GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory, backlog, services revenues and full year 2020 numbers in our slides. 
Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Jim?"

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their resilience and performance during 2020, a year of unprecedented challenges. 
The Caterpillar team continued to provide the essential products and services that enabled our customers to support society during the pandemic. In this difficult environment, we leveraged our strong safety culture and had the best year on record for employee safety. Our employees' generous contributions and volunteerism are also notable. We had a record level of support for worldwide relief efforts in 2020 through the Caterpillar Foundation.  
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I plan to briefly cover the following topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Cat's fourth quarter results. I'll then provide comments on our performance for the full year, followed by some high-level thoughts about 2021. I'll close by highlighting several ways we're advancing our strategy.  
Starting on Slide 4, I'll recap fourth quarter results versus 1 year ago. Sales and revenues of $11.2 billion decreased 15%, about as we expected. Lower sales volume drove the decline reflecting lower end-user demand and reductions in dealer inventory. Dealers decreased their inventories by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, roughly $400 million more than we expected. For the full year, dealers reduced their inventories by $2.9 billion. This positions us well to produce closer to demand in 2021, which was our goal when we introduced our enhanced S&OP process.  
Fourth quarter sales to users declined by 10% versus the previous year. Sales to users for both construction and mining equipment were better than we expected. While fourth quarter 2020 operating margins declined year-on-year, they improved by 230 basis points versus the third quarter. At 12.3%, they were better than we expected, reflecting better operational performance. Restructuring expense was lower than we expected as was the effective tax rate. Profit per share in the fourth quarter was $1.42. Adjusted profit per share was $2.12.  
Regarding our full year results on Slide 5, we said at the start of the pandemic, it would be challenging to achieve the operating margin target we communicated during our 2019 Investor Day due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and supply chain, as well as our intent to continue investing in new products and services to drive long-term profitable growth. So we're pleased that our final operating margin for 2020 was within our targeted range. We finished 2020 with sales and revenues of $41.7 billion and an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8%. 
Our ME&T free cash flow for the full year was $3.1 billion. While we did not achieve our target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion, our free cash flow performance improved as the year progressed. Our decision to hold higher Caterpillar inventory to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and to position ourselves for changes in market demand also impacted our free cash flow generation in 2020, as Andrew will discuss shortly. We remain focused on returning substantially all ME&T free cash to shareholders through the cycles, and we returned $3.4 billion or 110% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases in 2020.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide some comments on our end markets. Market conditions remain fluid due to the pandemic. However, I'll provide some thoughts based on what we see today. In Construction Industries, we see construction in North America benefiting from increased residential demand. We expect a strong selling season in China, including demand for our new GX excavator line. 
We expect continued recovery in the rest of Asia Pacific. The current shutdown in some regions of EAME may constrain construction activity in Europe in the short term. However, we expect improved market conditions due to favorable expansionary policies as well as benefits from higher commodity prices in Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia. In Latin America, we see Brazil's construction sector supportive of machine demand while weakness outside Brazil is expected to continue at least in the short term.  
Turning to Resource Industries. The improvement in mining fundamentals is expected to continue. We anticipate most mine sites to continue operating with limited disruptions and high levels of truck activity. In addition, metal prices are supportive of reinvestment and quoting activity continues to be robust. The number of parked trucks continued to decline. We continue to see strong interest in autonomy. Heavy construction and quarry and aggregate markets remain uncertain. A U.S. infrastructure bill would likely have a positive impact on these end markets.  
Moving to Energy & Transportation, we expect typical seasonality. Although we are encouraged by recent moves in oil prices, we expect oil and gas will continue to reflect conditions in that market. We expect some improvement in power generation supported by data center activity. We expect growth in industrial across all applications, and transportation should grow due to services and higher international rail activity later in the year. 
Overall, we expect our sales in 2021 to be stronger due to the lack of a dealer inventory reduction and improving market conditions, as I've described. We also expect services revenues to increase during the year.  
Given the continuing uncertainty, we're not providing earnings guidance at this time. Andrew will provide several assumptions for the first quarter in a moment, but we expect the first quarter to benefit from stronger year-over-year sales to users and dealer restocking. We also expect modestly higher margins in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.  
You may recall that during our third quarter earnings call, I said that I felt better today than I did a quarter ago, and the same is true today for the reasons I explained earlier concerning our markets. In addition, we're executing well against our strategy for long-term profitable growth. 
We expect to achieve our Investor Day operating margin targets in 2021 despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. We also expect to meet our Investor Day free cash flow targets this year. Given our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders as well as our desire to be in the market on a regular basis, we expect to revisit our current pause in share repurchases later this year.  
We have paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, all decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year.  
We signed an agreement last quarter to acquire Weir's Oil & Gas business. We see a strong fit between Weir and our current offerings. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve our existing customer base while adding services revenue opportunities. We anticipate the acquisition will close very soon.  
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. We're focused on operational excellence and continue to invest in services and expanded offerings during the pandemic. An example of our continued investment in expanded offerings was our new GX line of excavators launched in November in China, which has received a positive response from our customers. The GX series provides the durability, safety and services that customers expect, plus 15% lower fuel consumption than the prior models. It also offers 25% lower maintenance cost. 
Our technology, along with our engineering know-how and global dealer network, has always played a pivotal role in making our customers more successful with Caterpillar.  
For the first time, we displayed some of our technology at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month. We featured Cat MineStar, a suite of technology and solutions that powers our autonomous trucks. With Cat MineStar, customers say their employees are safer, machines are more efficient and operations are more consistent and productive. Customers have realized productivity increases of up to 30% with 0 reportable injuries. We believe our autonomous capabilities provide a competitive advantage in mining.  
We were recently awarded research funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for 2 development projects. The first project, which is expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, is a 3-year program for a hydrogen fuel cell system for data center power. The second project is expected to launch in mid-2021 and is a 3-year program related to a flexible natural gas and hydrogen combined heat and power system.  
Caterpillar announced 2020 sustainability goals in 2006, and we're proud of our progress. By 2019, we'd reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 54% from our 2006 baseline exceeding our goal of 50%, and more than 35% of our electrical energy was obtained from renewables or alternative sources exceeding our 2020 goal of 20%. We'll disclose our final 2020 goal attainment in May when we also plan to disclose our new sustainability goals for the next horizon.  
I'll also comment on services, which is an important element of our strategy. As you know, we have a target of doubling our services revenue from 2012 to 2026. Our annual services revenue declined 13% to $16 billion in 2020 versus the prior year. As we expected, services were less cyclical than original equipment and rose as a percentage of sales, representing 41% of ME&T sales in 2020. 
Year-over-year services declines reflected the reduction in machine hours related to the pandemic and customer decisions to delay planned maintenance and rebuilds as they sought to conserve cash. However, we did see an increase in customer value agreements, both in the number and the average length. With over 1 million connected assets, we feel we have critical mass from a connectivity perspective, which will leverage to increase services sales over time.  
In the coming year, we expect to return to growth in services. We did see positive momentum from the third to the fourth quarter of 2020. All 3 segments have detailed plans to increase services by making our customers more successful.  
In summary, we continue executing our strategy, improving operational excellence and investing in expanded offerings and services to help our customers succeed. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and intend to deliver higher margins and free cash flow through the cycles, as outlined during our 2019 Investor Day. 
We're grateful for our team's accomplishments in 2020, including their high level of engagement. We have a great team and we'll emerge from the pandemic as an even stronger company well positioned for long-term profitable growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew."

I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key",2751,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by walking you through the fourth quarter results, including sales to users, changes in dealer inventory and segment performance. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet, before finishing with our key assumptions for the first quarter of 2021.  
Starting with the fourth quarter on Slide 8. Versus last year, sales and revenues declined by 15% to $11.2 billion. Operating profit decreased by 25% to $1.4 billion. Good cost control in the quarter partly offset the impacts of lower volume. Fourth quarter 2020 profit per share was $1.42. That included pretax remeasurement losses of $438 million or $0.63 per share, resulting from the settlements of pension and other postretirement obligations. Last year's profit per share for the fourth quarter was $1.97. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share was $2.12 compared to $2.71 last year. 
You will have seen from the release that the full year effective tax rate was approximately 28%, excluding discrete items. This was lower than the 31% rate we'd anticipated and added $0.26 to profit per share. We also had a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding restructuring expense, adds another $0.07 per share. The balance of the outperformance reflect a better-than-expected operating results, which saw adjusted operating margins improve by 170 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.  
Since 2019, we have only reported adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter when we had mark-to-market impacts from our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. This change happened because restructuring expense have returned to base levels, which was between $100 million and $200 million per annum. This was not considered material and did not warrant adjusting profit per share. 
However, restructuring expenses risen to $350 million this year as we took additional actions to address certain challenged products. We also expect restructuring expense in 2021 to be similar to or even greater than the 2020 total as we continue to take the necessary actions to improve our cost competitiveness. So we're now reporting adjusted profits per share excluding restructuring charges, and we'll report adjusted profit per share each quarter in the coming year to exclude restructuring. We've also adjusted the prior year numbers, so they're on a comparable basis. Our restructuring efforts in 2020 made good progress, and we expect $150 million benefit in 2021 from these actions.  
As shown on Slide 9, overall sales and revenues finished fairly close to what we anticipated in October as stronger end-user demand was offset by further reductions in dealer inventory. The top line declined by $1.9 billion to $11.2 billion, primarily due to lower volume and a larger year-on-year reduction in dealer inventory. 
As Jim mentioned, sales to users decreased by 10% for the fourth quarter. Sales to users for construction industries declined by 1% versus the prior year. It was a mixed bag geographically as Asia Pacific rose by 16%, benefiting from stimulus spending in China. Latin America also improved up 11%. North America was down 8%, a solid improvement from the third quarter trend. 
Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, had a 3% decline for the quarter. Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 25%. The largest driver of that decline was attributed to lower levels of activity in oil and gas.  
Between earning calls, we've been reporting rolling 3-month sales to users every month. Going forward, we will report to sales to users only once per quarter when we discuss earnings so we can put them in the proper context.  
Machine orders improved in the fourth quarter as dealers began preparing for the spring selling season and the Chinese New Year. Machine orders accelerated by the double-digit percentage terms from the fourth -- third quarter to the fourth, in line with normal trends. 
Dealers decreased inventories by $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. That compares with a decrease of $700 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Improving sales to users enabled dealers to reduce their inventory by about $400 million more than we had anticipated in October. Dealers reduced inventory over the course of 2020 by $2.9 billion. This change brought their inventory levels to the lower end of their normal range for months of sales. As you know, dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions on inventory.  
In the first quarter of 2020, we finished the rollout of our new S&OP process which we believe promoted better alignment between us and our dealers through a volatile year. This dealer inventory reduction positions us well for 2021.  
Reported sales decreased versus the prior year in all 3 primary segments. Energy & Transportation contributed the majority of the decrease in total sales, declining by 19%. This segment had weakness in all 4 applications, led by oil and gas and transportation. Sales in Construction Industries declined by 10% due to lower sales volume associated with the reduction in end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories. Sales in Resource Industries decreased by 9% due to lower end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts.  
I'll now move to Slide 10. Operating profit for the fourth quarter fell by 25% to $1.4 billion, mostly due to volume declines. Similar to the trend we've seen throughout the year, lower manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expense partially mitigated the decline in volume. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%. Restructuring expense for the quarter was flat at $58 million compared with $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
I'll discuss the individual segments results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11 with Construction Industries. For Construction Industries, sales decreased by 10% to $4.5 billion. Volume declines resulted from changes in dealer inventories, led by North America, and lower end-user demand. We also saw lower sales in China, in part due to lower dealer inventory, which included the impact of a later Chinese New Year in 2021. However, sales to users were better than expected, and we're seeing momentum in residential construction, although we're still seeing weakness in pipeline and road construction. 
The segment's fourth quarter profit decreased by 4% to $630 million, driven by lower volume and higher warranty expense. That was partially offset by favorable cost absorption and lower SG&A and R&D expenses, including the absence of short-term incentive compensation. Margins remained resilient, rising 90 basis points versus 2019 to 14.0%. Versus the third quarter, margins were down slightly. This was a smaller seasonal decline than we normally see, reflecting the improvement in the top line quarter-over-quarter.  
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 9% in the fourth quarter to $2.2 billion. We experienced lower engines demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, supporting heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, and to a lesser extent, in mining. As anticipated, sales for Resource Industries improved compared with the third quarter. 
Despite lower sales in the fourth quarter, profit increased to $273 million compared with $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The segment's profit margin of 12.5% rose by 160 basis points compared to 2019 on strong cost controls. Variable labor and burden efficiencies as well as material costs were favorable despite the lower sales volume. SG&A and R&D expenses benefited from lower short-term incentive compensation and other cost-reduction actions, and benefits were realized from prior restructuring programs. Versus the third quarter, the operating improved by 330 basis points, mainly reflecting the higher volume.  
Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales of Energy & Transportation declined by 19% to $4.8 billion. The decline included a 29% sales decrease in oil and gas, mainly due to lower demand in North America for reciprocating engines using gas compression and well servicing. Sales were also lower for turbines and turbine-related services. Power generation sales decreased by 9%. This decline was primarily due to lower sales volume in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services and engine aftermarket parts. 
Transportation and industrial sales decreased by 28% and 19%, respectively. Transportation declines reflected lower locomotive deliveries and related service revenues primarily in North America, as well as lower sales in marine. Profit for the segment decreased by 41% to $687 million due to lower sales volume. That was partially offset by lower SG&A, R&D and period manufacturing costs. 
The segment's operating margin declined to 14.3%, a 530 basis point decrease in comparison to a record quarter a year ago. Versus the third quarter, the operating margin improvement was 250 basis points reflecting the higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by the timing of product development expenses, which we mentioned in the third quarter call.  
Moving to Slide 14 to wrap up the segment commentary. Financial Products revenue decreased by $103 million or 12% to $743 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in North America. The latter reflected lower purchase receivables, which resulted from volume declines. 
Segment profit of $195 million declined by 7% year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher provision for credit losses and lower earning assets. While used prices were flat to up in construction equipment, we also had an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed marine and mining products. 
Our customers remain in good financial condition. Credit applications continued to rebound in the quarter, up 6% compared to the third quarter and up 15% compared to a year ago. Cat Financials supported customers during the year with a streamlined process for loan modifications, but modification activity declined significantly and requests for second modifications remain very limited. 
Past dues were 3.49%, up 35% year-over-year, but an improvement of 32 basis points from the third quarter. As has been the case, Cat Financial will continue to work closely with customers as they manage the impacts of COVID-19 on their business and cash flow, but we are pleased to see that our customers remain in good financial health. 
Now on Slide 15. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was about $1.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $200 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease reflected changes in Caterpillar inventory as our inventories remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a decrease in 2019. As we've mentioned previously, we continue to hold higher Caterpillar inventory, primarily in components and other work in process to ensure that any potential disruptions to supply do not affect our customers and to make sure we're able to respond quickly to improved demand. 
However, free cash flow from ME&T did increase by $800 million versus the third quarter of this year. The sequential improvement was largely due to the higher profit and favorable working capital. We generated $3.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in 2020. Although this was below our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion, we expect to return to our Investor Day cash targets in 2021. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.4 billion in enterprise cash and maintained a strong liquidity position. 
You will recall that we issued $2 billion in debt last year partly to increase liquidity and partly anticipation of $1.4 billion in scheduled maturities this year. Our credit ratings remain strong. We recently declared our normal quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, which translates to around $560 million. As Jim has indicated, we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. All decisions concerning the dividend are made by our Board of Directors, but we anticipate recommending an increase in the current year. 
Last year, including the quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases made early in the year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our intention at Investor Day was to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. And in 2020, we returned 110% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, over the past 3 years, on average, we've returned 106% and we've reduced our quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 10% since the first quarter of 2018. 
While share repurchases were paused in April due to uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we aim to be in the market on a regular basis. Given what we're seeing in the business, we expect to revisit the decision to pause our share repurchase program later this year. We also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we can use for compelling M&A opportunities such as our pending agreement to purchase the Weir Group's Oil & Gas business. 
Whilst we're not providing annual guidance, we do have a few thoughts on the first quarter. A summary of our key assumptions is shown on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we expect stronger year-over-year sales to users, due mainly to growth in Construction Industries. We anticipate ongoing strength in China and benefits from the pickup in residential construction in North America, although nonresidential remained subdued. 
We expect Resource Industries, a lumpy business, to begin the year a little lower with a similar year-over-year STU trend to what we saw in Q4. Energy & Transportation is also expected to have a negative start to the year, although the trends are expected to improve versus the sharp drops in sales to users reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a reminder, our sales to users were only impacted marginally in the first quarter of 2020, so we expect stronger STU growth in the remainder of 2021. 
We expect a normal seasonal dealer inventory build in anticipation of the spring selling season. Note that the Chinese New Year is about 3 weeks later this year. So the inventory built for Asia Pacific has shifted more to the first quarter of 2021 rather than occurring in the fourth quarter has happened between 2019 and 2020. 
Our aim this year is to produce closer to end-user demand and we anticipate dealers will remain within their normal range for sales -- months of sales in inventories. Again, we will benefit in 2021 from not having the headwind of the dealer inventory reductions that took place in 2020. 
With respect to operating margins, we expect a sequential improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth, even with the impact of about $225 million from restoring short-term incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis, the benefit of higher volumes will almost entirely offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation, which means we expect operating margins to be about flat versus Q1 2020. 
As Jim mentioned in his comments, we do expect to deliver margins in the Investor Day range as the benefits of operating leverage and the restructuring cost actions I mentioned earlier will offset the impact of short-term incentive compensation and high expenses that were deferred into 2021. 
Looking at margins by segment. In Construction Industries, stronger sales and leverage on higher volumes are anticipated to drive the sequential margin expansion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter despite the impact of short-term incentive compensation. Resource Industries is also anticipated to have a higher-margin sequentially on higher sales and leverage, along with favorable mix. 
However, from a margin perspective, Energy & Transportation is likely to have a weaker start to the year, which is in line with typical seasonality. This excludes any impact from the Weir acquisition, which we anticipate will close very soon, although we don't expect it to be material to our full year results. 
In addition, we assume a tax rate in the first quarter of about 26% to 28%, consistent with what we project for the full year based on the current U.S. statutory tax rate. This is in line with the tax rate we have reported in 2020. We'd expect normal CapEx at a pace that would translate to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. 
So finally, let's turn to Slide 17 and let me recap today's key points. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while improving operational excellence. In the fourth quarter, trends in sales to users improved compared to the third quarter, dealer inventories declined and we improved adjusted operating margins relative to Q3. 
We expect to see improved margin sequentially and stronger volumes in the first quarter. We're grateful to our employees for ensuring we provided the essential products and services that enable our customers to support a world in need, and then most importantly for doing so safely. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Jason to prepare for the Q&A session."

So Jim, can you provide your thoughts on those 2 issues, particularly the second issue of the portfolio and how we should think of acquisitions, maybe help changing that investor view? I mean, especially given your net debt to EBITDA and that's on a weak 2020 EBITDA, is only 0.4. And if you can tie into that, with the percentage of aftermarket revenues you gave this morning, it does suggest your aftermarket revenues have to grow at a 9.8% CAGR from 2020 to '26 to meet your revenue goal of $28 billion in 2026 for aftermarket. So if you can talk to those issues, it would be helpful as people think about the whole cycle."

We also, as when you asked the question last quarter, I talked about the fact that we do intend to continue to support our customers both during and after the transition. And so I believe we're well positioned to do that. So again, we continue to work closely with our customers. We continue to invest in new products. 
Again, last quarter, when you asked the question, we talked about some of the things that we're doing in terms of investments with new products. And we have an all-electric switch locomotive. We've done things to help make our oil and gas customers more sustainable, whether it be an engine that allows them to substitute up to 85% natural gas -- substituting natural gas for diesel fuel for well servicing. We're doing things in terms of allowing oil and gas customers to reduce flaring. So again, a whole variety of things that we're doing and we're investing in to support our customers, both during and after the energy transition. 
In terms of your question about services, certainly, our goal is an ambitious goal, and we said that when we introduced that goal, and we certainly recognize that it is ambitious, but we're very focused on this as a business. We've been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities and our -- many of our processes in our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward.

You look at Resource and Construction, your margins improved year-on-year despite sales declines. You look at your margins for the total year, they were about 11%, which is above the low end of your targeted range. And taking into account, you said you didn't think you'd be able to hit your targeted range when COVID first started. So clearly, it looks like the margin performance of the business is doing better than you originally anticipated. 
So can -- is there any way you can help us understand what's happening there? I'm just trying to figure out if the margin targets that you laid out at the Analyst Day, if there's some upside there, if there's a reason structurally why margins are performing better, in particular given some of the headwinds that we faced this year with COVID, dealer inventory, et cetera."

And certainly, we are very proud of our team and the fact that we were able to achieve our Investor Day targets this year despite the fact that we continue to invest in services and expanded offerings and new products and positioning ourselves for long-term profitable growth. As we said in Investor Day, our measure of profitable growth is absolute OPEB dollars. And we believe that by growing absolute OPEB dollars, that will drive long-term TSR. 
So certainly, we're always looking across the business to find ways to improve our competitiveness, to improve our footprint, to improve cost of our back office operations. So that's a never-ending journey that we're on. But we really are growing -- attempting to grow long term absolute OPEB dollars as opposed to just squeezing higher margins out. Again, margins will fluctuate over time. But again, keep in mind 2 things. One is we're very focused on meeting those Investor Day targets in terms of margins and free cash flow. And we're also very focused on growing absolute OPEB dollars to grow long-term TSR."

But Cat spent about 60% of depreciation on CapEx in 2020. You've underspent depreciation by a pretty wide measure. I think every year going back to 2013, R&D spends down about $500 million from where it was at the trough of the last cycle. 
Should we be expecting some catch-up years on CapEx and R&D in the next several years? And if not, why not? And just with that, what are you baking in for R&D and CapEx in 2021?"

But we're very committed. And we talked about the GX product line. We talked about some of the other investments that we're making in new products, and that's something that we will continue to do. We talked about the fact that we recognize there is an energy transition occurring, and we are investing in and we'll continue to invest in new technologies that allow us to support our customers moving forward. 
In terms of CapEx, one of the things we worked very hard on is lean operations to get more production out of existing bricks and mortar. So rather than build -- continue to build factories we may not need at certain points in the cycle, we're really focused on manufacturing flexibility, working across that value chain, reducing lead times, becoming more lean to try to meet those fluctuations in demand in a cost-effective manner."

As I said in my remarks, when we get to a base level, which is between $100 million and $200 million, it is effectively at a level where it's not material and therefore it doesn't warrant us adjusting profit per share for that. Given the size of the spend, the magnitude of the spend, $354 million, and as we say we expect a similar level, maybe slightly higher in 2021, that does require us to be consistent with where we've been in historic periods. And therefore, do exclude it. 
I know it's a -- it causes you guys some challenge in because you have to go back and restate your models. But unfortunately, it is one of those things which, from a disclosure perspective, is a good practice for us to do. As regards what the spend is, obviously, some of the spend will be ongoing programs, as Jim mentioned. But some of those programs actually do have -- or are multiyear program, they're not just a single year, and so some of that spend does recur.

And we do feel strongly that we have a competitive advantage with our autonomous solution. And generally, it requires a certain size in terms of a mine in terms of number of trucks for the capital investment to make sense, but we're continually working on that as well. So there's a lot of opportunity going forward in mining with autonomy. 
And you make a very good point. Now we are starting to deploy some of those technologies. We have a lot of programs in work to deploy a lot of that technology, whether it's autonomy, semi-autonomy, remote control, many of those same kinds of technologies into Construction Industries.

So that helps our free cash flow, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our free cash flow targets in 2021. 
The other thing just to remember, on the working capital and cash flow basis, is obviously, last year, in 2020, we paid about $700 million of short-term incentive compensation. We will not have that in 2021. So that will be, again, a strong boost to our cash position as we go through the year. But the one thing I would say that to me, that has been really remarkable is to remind you again in a year of significant turmoil where we've held sort of additional inventory, we have still been able to generate free cash flow of $3.1 billion.

During our call today, we'll be discussing the earnings news release we issued earlier this morning. You can find our slides, the news release and a video recap at investors.caterpillar.com, by clicking on Events & Presentations. Also please note that we've published a new Caterpillar 2020 data book for investors, which you can also find today on the homepage of the IR website.

We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate, could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. Caterpillar has copyrighted this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without the prior written approval of the company. 
Today, we reported profit per share of $2.77 for the first quarter compared with $1.98 in the first quarter of 2020. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.87 for the first quarter. That compares with first quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share of $1.65.  Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs. The first quarter of 2020 also excluded a remeasurement gain of $0.38 per share, resulting from the settlement of a non-U.S. pension obligation.
We provide a non-GAAP reconciliation in the Appendix of this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory and backlog in our earnings call slides.
Speaking of slides. Before I turn it to Jim, there have been a few questions this morning on Slide 16, key thoughts on the second quarter, the final bullet. We expect the operating profit margin percentage in the second quarter of 2021 to be moderately below the margin in the first quarter of 2021.
Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3, and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby."

I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for continuing to safely provide the essential products and services that enable our customers to support society during the pandemic. Our engaged team continues to execute our strategy, which is demonstrated by our first quarter results. I'll begin with my perspectives on the first quarter and our supply chain before discussing our end markets.
Starting with the top line on Slide 4. We're pleased with the strong sales and profit performance in the first quarter. Sales increased 12% on better-than-expected growth in the end-user demand and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventory. The decision to hold extra Caterpillar inventory to prepare for a potential increase in market demand served us well.
Total sales to users rose about 8%. Sales to users have trended better for the last 3 quarters from a year-over-year comparative perspective. Machine sales to users increased 13% in the quarter as Construction Industries and Resource Industries were stronger than we expected. Within Construction Industries, Asia Pacific was particularly strong, led by robust growth in.
Resource Industry sales to users were flat as market conditions continue to improve in mining. While sales to users for Energy & Transportation declined by 5% for the quarter, these results were roughly in line with our expectation and reflected industry trends. Dealer inventory increased about $700 million, which was about the seasonal build we expected, that compares with an increase of about $100 million in last year's first quarter. Operating profit in the quarter increased 29% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by higher volume, effective cost control and financial products. We delivered an operating margin of 15.3%. Adjusted operating margin came in at 15.8%, an improvement of 230 basis points versus a year ago and 300 basis points higher than our fourth quarter of last year, which had a lower level of sales. Operating margins expanded in all 3 primary segments, with the largest increase coming from Construction Industries. Andrew will provide more color concerning our margin performance in a few minutes.
ME&T free cash flow was very strong at approximately $1.7 billion a quarter. Our quarterly dividend was unchanged and share repurchases remained paused in the first quarter.
I'll now provide a few additional comments about the external environment. As Andrew will discuss, we're not providing annual earnings guidance at this time. We're pleased with our strong start to the year, and there are positive signs in a number of our end markets. However, we're monitoring a variety of external factors that could moderate the positive impact of continuing improvement in market conditions. These include the pandemic's recent acceleration in several overseas markets, the potential for supply chain disruptions and cost pressures. Areas of particular focus include semiconductors, transportation and raw materials. While none of these has significantly impacted our operations, they ramp the potential for impact later this year. The situation remains very fluid.
Our team has been developing contingency plans, including workarounds in our factories that may lead to increased costs. We're working very hard to avoid or minimize having supply chain issues lead to production shortfalls that might impact our ability to fully meet improving customer demand.
And now moving to Slide 5, I'll share some thoughts on our end markets based on what we see today. Starting with Construction Industries. North America will continue to benefit from strong residential demand. We see nonresidential construction recovering at a gradual pace, with infrastructure recovering faster than nonresidential building. We expect growth in Asia/Pacific to remain robust through the first half, driven by China. Government spending on infrastructure in China has fueled strong excavator demand, including strong demand for our new GX excavator line. We see improving demand in EAME and continued recovery in Latin America as well, although we are monitoring the recent acceleration of COVID in some Latin American countries.
Turning to Resource Industries. We anticipate continued improvement in demand, particularly in mining. Favorable commodity prices support higher CapEx from mining customers. We continue to feel optimistic about mining. We have a strong value proposition, particularly in autonomy-enabled products. We also expect growth in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates off a low base.
In Energy & Transportation, we expect strengthening across a number of applications. Oil and gas should continue to slowly improve from low levels as customers remain disciplined with our CapEx spend. The power generation market should benefit from continued strength in data centers. Industrial is expected to see growth, with activity strengthening across most applications. In transportation, rail and marine are expected to see slight improvements from the first quarter, although from a low base. We expect the company's top line to reflect normal seasonality in the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. We expect to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margins in 2021. As we stated before, our target is 300 to 600 basis points of improvement in our adjusted operating margins versus the 2010 to 2016 period. We've delivered at this level for 4 straight years now, including during the pandemic, which is a testament to our talented team and focused execution of our strategy.
Machine, Energy & Transportation's free cash flow was strong in the first quarter. These results strengthened our confidence that we'll meet our Investor Day target for ME&T free cash flow in 2021. The target is $4 billion to $8 billion or $1 billion to $2 billion higher than we generated in the 2010 to 2016 period.
We paid annual higher dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We're working with our Board of Directors on decisions concerning the potential dividend increase later this year.
We're also discussing with our board the appropriate time to recommence share repurchases. It remains our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. 
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. This strategy is focused on services, expanded offerings and operational excellence to drive long-term profitable growth. We continue to invest in expanded offerings, new technologies and services as we did throughout 2020.
In February, we closed on our acquisition of the Oil and Gas division of the Weir Group PLC and launched SPM Oil & Gas. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve existing customers by enabling us to offer a more complete integrated solution from engine to wellhead. In fact, to lower their carbon footprint, some customers have placed orders for SPM 5000-horsepower pumps, paired with CAT G 3520 natural gas power generator sets, for use in electrified pumping applications.
We also continue to invest in our digital capabilities to allow us to leverage our more than 1 million connected assets. We're developing proprietary algorithms called prioritized service events, or PSEs, that provide qualified services leads to our global dealer network. Our leads range from repair options that are asset serial member specific to complete fleet level solutions. We continue to make it easy for customers to have more predictable maintenance costs through customer value agreements, or CVAs.
During the past quarter, we've released our first diversity and inclusion report. The report describes our journey to build a more globally diverse workforce and inclusive environment to support our employees and the communities where we live and work. We value diverse perspectives and strive to ensure our global team reflects the many communities and customers we serve around the world. We're currently preparing our 2020 sustainability report, which will highlight progress against our 2020 goals and introduce new sustainability goals. We're committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future by continuing to reduce Caterpillar's greenhouse gas emissions and helping customers achieve their climate-related objectives.
In summary, I'm pleased with our strong start to the year and proud of the performance by our global team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I will start out with an overview of our first quarter results, then I will discuss segment performance and the balance sheet before concluding with some comments on the second quarter and remainder of 2021.
As we reported this morning and shown on Slide 8, sales of revenues for the first quarter increased by 12% to $11.9 billion on higher volumes. Operating profit of $1.8 billion rose by 29%, reflecting margin expansion, primarily due to higher volumes. First quarter profit per share was $2.77 compared to $1.98 in 2020. Adjusted profit per share was $2.87. 
It was a strong quarter. End-user demand was better than our expectations, primarily in Construction Industries, which also led to higher operating margins than we anticipated. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 15.8%. The higher operating profit reflected higher volume, solid execution, good cost management and strength in the financial products portfolio. These benefits more than offset the impact of reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program.
Looking more closely at the top line on Slide 9, the 12% increase in reported sales and revenues reflected strong growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and EAME. North America was about flat. In aggregate, sales to users increased by 8%. Dealer inventory rose as is seasonally typical led by Construction Industries. It increased by about $700 million versus an increase of about $100 million last year.
Sales for users for Construction Industries increased by 17% versus the prior year as end user demand, principally in North America, was better than our expectations. All geographic regions improved. Asia Pacific rose 36%, Latin America rose 38% and EAME rose 11%. North America increased 5%, marking its third straight quarter of sequential improvement in quarter-over-quarter end-user demand. 
Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, was flat, whereas we had expected a modest decline. Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 5%, which is broadly in line with our expectations. Amid stronger demand, availability remained within our normal ranges for the vast majority of our products. However, we've had some isolated instances impacting a handful of products, such as 2 compact product families in their building construction products portfolio. In these cases, we haven't been able to ramp up production as quickly as we'd like, mostly due to isolated issues with a small number of specific suppliers and/or labor availability. We are working hard to resolve these issues.
Now moving to Slide 10. Operating profit increased to $1.8 billion. The 29% improvement reflected better volume in our 3 primary segments and higher profits from financial products. That was partly offset by the impact of restoring short-term incentive compensation and some unfavorable price. Excluding the impact of short-term incentive compensation, manufacturing costs were favorable. We did see some benefit from lower material and warranty costs. We also had benefits from higher absorption of our manufacturing costs due to the level of Caterpillar inventory we built ahead of our second quarter selling season.
Obviously, certain spending, such as travel and consulting, is still being impacted by the lingering effects of COVID-19, which further improves our overall margins. In total, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 15.8%. The effective tax rate is 26%, which is the lower end of the range we anticipated in January. That excludes discrete tax benefits of $43 million or $0.08 per share in the first quarter.
Now let me discuss the individual segment's results for the first quarter beginning on Slide 11. For Construction Industries, sales increased by 27% to $5.5 billion compared to the prior year. Volume improved due to higher end-user demand and the impact from increases in dealer inventories. End user demand increased across all regions, and was especially pronounced in Asia Pacific. This was led by China, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, while supported in the first quarter of this year by government infrastructure spend.
In North America, high end-user demand was primarily fueled by residential construction. In total, dealers increased inventories by more this quarter compared to the prior year, principally in the Asia Pacific region, which benefited from a later Chinese New Year. The segment's first quarter profit increased by 62% to $1.035 billion due to the leverage on higher sales volume. Unfavorable price realization reflected geographic mix as the mix of sales shifted towards the Asia Pacific region. This and the impact of reinstating our short-term incentive plan partly offset the volume benefits. The segment operating margin increased by 410 basis points to 19%. 
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales increased by 6% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion. The most significant drivers were changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. End-user demand increases were driven by mining. Commodity prices, coupled with increased mine site activity, were both supportive. Demand in heavy construction and quarrying aggregates remained subdued. Sales increased in Latin America and EAME were about flat in Asia Pacific and decreased in North America.
The segment's first quarter profit increased by 8% to $328 million. The improvement was mainly due to lower manufacturing costs and higher sales volumes. Manufacturing costs reflected benefits from cost absorption, lower warranty cost expense and improvements in efficiency.
Price realization was a past set in the quarter due to several large strategic deals. These deals support a higher fuel population and services growth in the future, making them attractive over the long term. These benefits were partly offset by the impact of reinstating our short-term incentive plan. The segment's operating margin rose by 20 basis points to 14.8%. 
Now turning to Slide 13. First quarter sales of Energy & Transportation increased by 4% to $4.5 billion. That included a 6% sales increase in oil and gas, largely due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts in North America. Power generation sales improved by 13% due to increased sales for turbines and turbine-related services as well as large reciprocating engine applications as data center activity remains strong. 
Industrial sales were about flat. Transportation declined by 12%, mostly due to lower deliveries of locomotives and related services in North America as well as lower activity in marine. E&T's first quarter profit increased by 11% to $666 million. The improvement was led by higher sales volume, including intersegment sales and favorable variable manufacturing costs. That was partially offset by the impact of short-term incentive compensation expense. The segment's operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 14.8%. 
As Jim mentioned, we closed on our acquisition of SPM Oil & Gas in early February, and the integration is going well. The impact was not material to either sales or earnings for the quarter.
Moving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue decreased by $53 million or 7% to $761 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates and lower average earning assets in North America. However, segment profit improved on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Segment profit of $244 million increased 132% year-over-year, led by the mark-to-market impact on equity securities in our insurance services portfolio, in addition to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. The provision was favorable due to in part the absence of forecasted COVID-19-related impacts, which reduced our allowance for credit losses.
Beyond these impacts, Financial Products profit was relatively flat in the quarter. Past dues at the end of the first quarter were 2.9%, down 123 basis points year-over-year and down 59 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Credit applications remained strong as well, up 25% compared with the first quarter of 2020. While credit applications in the first quarter decreased compared to the fourth quarter, the sequential reduction was much smaller than normal seasonality would suggest, which bodes well for the future. Loan modifications were generally in line with historical trends, aside from a few countries where government -- the government is still mandating modifications due to COVID-19. We're pleased to see that overall, our customers remain in good financial health.
Now on Slide 15. As Jim mentioned, we expect to achieve our Investor Day target for Machinery, Energy & Transportation free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion this year. Free cash flow from ME&T was about $1.7 billion in the quarter versus about 0 in the first quarter last year. The increase reflects higher profit, the absence of a short-term incentive compensation payout and favorable working capital, the latter being due to higher payables.
In the first quarter, Caterpillar inventory rose about $700 million versus the fourth quarter as we increase production to meet improving end user demand. We are happy with our decision to hold higher levels of inventory as we exited 2020 as this has enabled us to ramp up production in the first quarter to meet our demand signals.
As Jim said, there is potential for supply chain disruptions and cost pressures on the horizon, and we're working hard to meet those challenges. We maintained a strong liquidity position and ended the first quarter with $11.3 billion in enterprise cash. Our balance sheet remains strong. We now have mid-A credit ratings across all of the major rating agencies as Moody's upgraded its rating on Caterpillar last week.
Our intention continues to be to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles via dividends and share repurchases. In the last 3 years, we have returned 106% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. We recently declared our normal quarterly on dividend of $1.03 per share or $560 million per quarter. We expect the Board will review a potential dividend increase later this year. We also expect to recommence share repurchases later this year.
We are not providing guidance for 2021, and I'll explain the reason why. At the current time, we are positive about the improving market conditions. On the other hand, there are some known risks, which are hard to quantify and the impact of such that the range of possible outcomes for 2021, while still positive, is actually quite wide at the stage of the year.
Turning to Slide 16. Overall, we expect second quarter sales to follow normal seasonality. We also expect overall growth in sales to users versus the prior year's quarterly comparative to be a significantly higher percentage than we saw in the first quarter. That is mainly due to easier comparisons.
A reminder that the second and third quarters saw the biggest impacts from the pandemic on total sales to users in 2020. We also don't expect to see a significant change in dealer inventories compared to the end of the first quarter of this year.
In Construction Industries, we expect sales to users to show continued positive growth as strength in residential construction in North America continues. Nonresidential construction is expected to recover at a gradual pace throughout the year. We expect China construction to remain strong, although the comparators with China become more challenging in the second half of 2021 versus the prior year as China recovered more quickly from the effects of the pandemic.
We expect strong end-user demand in Resource Industries compared to the prior year's quarter as demand in both mining and heavy construction and quarry in aggregates are expected to increase due to supported commodity prices and the restart of investments that were delayed last year. We expect to see continued improvement in end-user demand over the rest of the year as orders are strong amidst increasing minor CapEx spend. We also expect the recovery of heavy construction and aggregates from their low levels in 2020.
We expect Energy & Transportation sales to increase versus the second quarter of 2020. We expect oil and gas sales to have a slight growth, but customers will remain disciplined with CapEx. Solar had a strong second quarter in 2020 due to the timing of deliveries, which will make the comparisons tougher. Power Generation and Industrial are expected to grow versus the prior year. We expect slight improvement in transportation sales. Marine should improve, but remain at low levels, and rail is expected to be relatively flat.
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect a modest recovery through the year. Sales in E&T increase across all applications. Recovery in oil and gas should be slower as excess capacity and inventory overhang could limit upside.
In power generation, data centers should lead in an overall improving industry. Our expectations for solar have not changed, so we expect a relatively flat year. Industrial should grow moderately. Transportation should improve on strengthened rail services and international business, while expect marine to remain at lower levels.
Dealer inventory remains near the low end of the normal range. Changes in dealer inventories going forward will depend on a number of factors, including their views of future demand as well as supply chain limitations. At this stage, we do not expect a significant benefit from restocking in 2021.
As I discussed earlier, first quarter adjusted operating margins were particularly strong, improving by 230 basis points despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. There are a number of reasons why we expect the margin improvement to moderate as we go through the second quarter and the rest of the year.
We saw positive material costs in the first quarter as the benefits of holding more inventory in 2020 flow through the P&L. With the supply chain pressures and rising commodity costs, we expect material costs to become a headwind starting with the second quarter.
Freight costs were negative in the quarter. The constraints on freight are well known and will continue to impact us as we go through the year. Specific to the second quarter, we do expect absorption to be a headwind as we built Caterpillar inventory in the first quarter ahead of the selling season.
On the other side of the equation, we expect price to become favorable as we go through the year as geographic mix improves and the impact of price increases increasingly flow through, particularly in the second half. R&D expenses increased in the first quarter due to short-term incentive compensation expense. As we progress through the year, we expect spend in these areas to accelerate. COVID-related restrictions, on things like travel, are impacting spend, and we are also anticipating ramping up R&D project spending to support our services growth strategy as well as new product development. Investments in R&D can be comfortably managed within our Investor Day margin targets.
As Jim mentioned, we remain positive, but we're diligently monitoring the risks and their potential impact going forward. It's a fluid situation in terms of potential supply challenges, raw material cost pressures and pandemic-related concerns, areas where we have varying levels of control. Our aim is to minimize the impact of these factors and maximize factory uptime so we can satisfy improving customer demand.
Looking at some of our technical guidance, we had approximately $350 million in restructuring expense in 2020 and we still expect about $400 million in restructuring expense for 2021. The headwind from incentive compensation will now be approximately $325 million per quarter versus the $225 million estimated in January. We now anticipate a tax rate of 26% for the full year, which is at the lower end of our prior range. Our estimate for CapEx this year remains about $1.3 billion.
Turning to Slide 17. In summary, we expect to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margin and ME&T free cash flow in 2021. We continue to execute our strategy by investing in services and expanding offerings. These help us achieve a strong top line growth and solid margin expansion in our 3 primary segments as well as higher profits from financial products. It was a strong start to the year. There are some risks, but we have to deal with this move forward, particularly around the supply chain, but we are positive about the year and our team's ability to meet improving customer demand. 
With that, we're happy to take questions."

And then talking about overall margins, as I indicated a few moments ago, I mean, we actually saw material cost favorability in the first quarter. That's for a couple of reasons.
Obviously, the inventory we hold at the end of 2020 flow through the P&L now. And also, as we do buy steel forward, we have about a 3- to 6-month full contract normally on steel purchases. So we do expect material cost to move from positive to negative as we move forward. However, we are pricing accordingly. And with geo mix as well becoming favorable, we hope to be able to offset the 2. 
Obviously, there is continued risk, obviously, a material inflation as we look out. Overall, though, as we always remind you, commodity increases are net positive for us at Caterpillar because it helps our customers buy more.
On SG&A and R&D, spend was relatively low in Q1. Part of that, obviously, although, obviously, we did have short-term incentive comp increases. Part of that, obviously, is in the environment we're still working in They're still ramping up going on in projects. Obviously, if you've got a new project, we ended a lot of projects at the end of last year. Starting them becomes a lot more difficult in an environment where people aren't altogether. We expect that to accelerate as we go through the year, that particularly will impact R&D spend. And then obviously, travel will impact SG&A as we get people back out on the road and people want to go out and meet customers, that will impact us as we go forward. So those are the sort of bits.
As far as the top line is concerned, I mean, obviously, that's going to depend on, as we talked about, the ability to meet the demand profile out there and how actually customers feel as we go through the year, as we indicated, demand signals are improving. And obviously, that's going to be something we'll continue to monitor and may impact overall how the quarters trend out from a top line perspective."

And we've been talking about this for the last few quarters that we're having very positive conversations with our mining customers. Certainly, they're being disciplined in their capital expenditures, but things are improving. So our orders are improving.
There's a number of projects that we're tendering that are multiyear in nature. We feel very positive about our competitive position because of our autonomous solution across a number of products. So again, as I talked about earlier, we're not expecting a very fast ramp-up or a spike. We're seeing more of a gradual improvement, and that's continuing. And so again, we're quite encouraged by what we see. 
Now you just have to think about how Caterpillar is positioned from a mining perspective as the energy transition occurs with the growth of EVs, with just the amount of demand that will be created by that, Caterpillar is very well positioned to take advantage of that and to serve our customers, make them more successful, and it will be good for us and our dealers as well."

Caterpillar has copyrighted this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without the prior written approval of the company. 
Today, we reported profit per share of $2.77 for the first quarter compared with $1.98 in the first quarter of 2020. We're showing adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. 
Our adjusted profit per share was $2.87 for the first quarter. That compares with first quarter 2020 adjusted profit per share of $1.65. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs. 
The first quarter of 2020 also excluded a remeasurement gain of $0.38 per share, resulting from the settlement of a non-U.S. pension obligation. 
We provide a non-GAAP reconciliation in the appendix of this morning's news release. You can also find information on dealer inventory and backlog in our earnings call slides. 
Speaking of slides. Before I turn it to Jim, there have been a few questions this morning on Slide 16, key thoughts on the second quarter, the final bullet. We expect the operating profit margin percentage in the second quarter of 2021 to be moderately below the margin in the first quarter of 2021. 
Now with that, let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby."

I'd like to begin by thanking our global team for continuing to safely provide the essential products and services that enable our customers to support society during the pandemic. Our engaged team continues to execute our strategy, which is demonstrated by our first quarter results. I'll begin with my perspective on the first quarter and our supply chain before discussing our end markets. 
Starting with the top line on Slide 4. We're pleased with the strong sales and profit performance in the first quarter. Sales increased 12% on better-than-expected growth in end-user demand and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventory. The decision to hold extra Caterpillar inventory to prepare for a potential increase in market demand served us well. 
Total sales to users rose about 8%. Sales to users have trended better for the last 3 quarters from a year-over-year comparative perspective. Machine sales to users increased 13% in the quarter as Construction Industries and Resource Industries were stronger than we expected. Within Construction Industries, Asia/Pacific was particularly strong, led by robust growth in China. 
Resource Industries sales to users were flat as market conditions continued to improve in mining. 
While sales to users for Energy & Transportation declined by 5% for the quarter, these results were roughly in line with our expectations and reflected industry trends. 
Dealer inventory increased about $700 million, which was about the seasonal build we expected. That compares with an increase of about $100 million in last year's first quarter. 
Operating profit in the quarter increased 29% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by higher volume, effective cost control and financial products. We delivered an operating margin of 15.3%. 
Adjusted operating margin came in at 15.8%, an improvement of 230 basis points versus a year ago and 300 basis points higher than our fourth quarter of last year, which had a lower level of sales. 
Operating margins expanded in all 3 primary segments with the largest increase coming from Construction Industries. Andrew will provide more color concerning our margin performance in a few minutes. 
ME&T free cash flow was very strong at approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter. 
Our quarterly dividend was unchanged, and share repurchases remained paused in the first quarter. 
I'll now provide a few additional comments about the external environment. As Andrew will discuss, we're not providing annual earnings guidance at this time. We're pleased with our strong start to the year and there are positive signs in a number of our end markets. However, we're monitoring a variety of external factors that could moderate the positive impact of continuing improvement in market conditions. These include the pandemic's recent acceleration in several overseas markets, the potential for supply chain disruptions and cost pressures. Areas of particular focus include semiconductors, transportation and raw materials. While none of these has significantly impacted our operations, there remains the potential for impact later this year. The situation remains very fluid. 
Our team has been developing contingency plans, including workarounds in our factories that may lead to increased costs. We're working very hard to avoid or minimize having supply chain issues lead to production shortfalls that might impact our ability to fully meet improving customer demand. 
And now moving to Slide 5, I'll share some thoughts on our end markets based on what we see today. Starting with Construction Industries, North America will continue to benefit from strong residential demand. We see nonresidential construction recovering at a gradual pace with infrastructure recovering faster than nonresidential building. We expect growth in Asia/Pacific to remain robust through the first half, driven by China. 
Government spending on infrastructure in China has fueled strong excavator demand, including strong demand for our new GX excavator line. We see improving demand in EAME and continued recovery in Latin America as well, although we are monitoring the recent acceleration of COVID in some Latin American countries. 
Turning to Resource Industries. We anticipate continued improvement in demand, particularly in mining. Favorable commodity prices support higher CapEx from mining customers. We continue to feel optimistic about mining. We have a strong value proposition, particularly in autonomy-enabled products. We also expect growth in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates off a low base. 
In Energy & Transportation, we expect strengthening across a number of applications. Oil and gas should continue to slowly improve from low levels as customers remain disciplined with their CapEx spend. The power generation market should benefit from continued strength in data centers. Industrial is expected to see growth, with activity strengthening across most applications. In transportation, rail and marine are expected to see slight improvements from the first quarter, although from a low base. We expect the company's top line to reflect normal seasonality in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. We expect to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margins in 2021. As we stated before, our target is 300 to 600 basis points of improvement in our adjusted operating margins versus the 2010 to 2016 period. We've delivered at this level for 4 straight years now, including during the pandemic, which is a testament to our talented team and focused execution of our strategy. 
Machine, Energy & Transportation's free cash flow was strong in the first quarter. These results strengthened our confidence that we'll meet our Investor Day target for ME&T free cash flow in 2021. The target is $4 billion to $8 billion or $1 billion to $2 billion higher than we generated in the 2010 to 2016 period. 
We paid annual higher dividends to shareholders for 27 consecutive years, and we're proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We're working with our Board of Directors on decisions concerning the potential dividend increase later this year. 
We're also discussing with our Board the appropriate time to recommence share repurchases. It remains our intention to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles.  
Turning to Slide 7. We remain committed to our strategy, which we launched in 2017. This strategy is focused on services, expanded offerings and operational excellence to drive long-term profitable growth. We continue to invest in expanded offerings, new technologies and services as we did throughout 2020. 
In February, we closed on our acquisition of the Oil & Gas division of the Weir Group PLC and launched SPM Oil & Gas. This strategic transaction enhances our ability to serve existing customers by enabling us to offer a more complete integrated solution from engine to wellhead. In fact, to lower their carbon footprint, some customers have placed orders for SPM 5000-horsepower pumps, paired with Cat G3520 natural gas power generator sets for use in electrified pumping applications. 
We also continued to invest in our digital capabilities to allow us to leverage our more than 1 million connected assets. We're developing proprietary algorithms called Prioritized Service Events, or PSEs, that provide qualified services leads to our global dealer network. Our leads range from repair options that are asset serial number-specific to complete fleet level solutions. We continue to make it easy for customers to have more predictable maintenance costs through customer value agreements or CVAs. 
During the past quarter, we've released our first diversity and inclusion report. The report describes our journey to build a more globally diverse workforce and inclusive environment to support our employees in the communities where we live and work. We value diverse perspectives and strive to ensure our global team reflects the many communities and customers we serve around the world. 
We're currently preparing our 2020 sustainability report, which will highlight progress against our 2020 goals and introduce new sustainability goals. We're committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future by continuing to reduce Caterpillar's greenhouse gas emissions and helping customers achieve their climate-related objectives. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our strong start to the year and proud of the performance by our global team. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

I will start out with an overview of our first quarter results then I will discuss segment performance and the balance sheet before concluding with some comments on the second quarter and remainder of 2021. 
As we reported this morning and shown on Slide 8, sales of revenues for the first quarter increased by 12% to $11.9 billion on higher volumes. Operating profit of $1.8 billion rose by 29%, reflecting margin expansion primarily due to higher volumes. First quarter profit per share was $2.77 compared to $1.98 in 2020. Adjusted profit per share was $2.87.  
It was a strong quarter. End-user demand was better than our expectations, primarily in Construction Industries, which also led to higher operating margins than we anticipated. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 15.8%. The higher operating profit reflected higher volume, solid execution, good cost management and strength in the financial products portfolio. These benefits more than offset the impact of reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program. 
Looking more closely at the top line on Slide 9, the 12% increase in reported sales and revenues reflected strong growth in Asia/Pacific, Latin America and EAME. North America was about flat. In aggregate, sales to users increased by 8%. 
Dealer inventory rose as is seasonally typical led by Construction Industries. It increased by about $700 million versus an increase of about $100 million last year. 
Sales for users for Construction Industries increased by 17% versus the prior year as end-user demand, principally in North America, was better than our expectations. All geographic regions improved. Asia/Pacific rose 36%, Latin America rose 38% and EAME rose 11%. North America increased 5%, marking its third straight quarter of sequential improvement in quarter-over-quarter end-user demand.  
Resource Industries, which tends to be lumpy, was flat, whereas we had expected modest decline. 
Energy & Transportation sales to users decreased by 5%, which is broadly in line with our expectations. 
Amid stronger demand, availability remained within our normal ranges for the vast majority of our products. However, we've had some isolated instances impacting a handful of products, such as 2 compact product families in their building construction products portfolio. In these cases, we haven't been able to ramp up production as quickly as we'd like mostly due to isolated issues with a small number of specific suppliers and/or labor availability. We are working hard to resolve these issues. 
Now moving to Slide 10. Operating profit increased to $1.8 billion. The 29% improvement reflected better volume in our 3 primary segments and higher profits from Financial Products. That was partly offset by the impact of restoring short-term incentive compensation and some unfavorable price. Excluding the impact of short-term incentive compensation, manufacturing costs were favorable. We did see some benefit from lower material and warranty costs. We also had benefits from higher absorption of our manufacturing costs due to the level of Caterpillar inventory we built ahead of our second quarter selling season. 
Obviously, certain spending, such as travel and consulting, is still being impacted by the lingering effects of COVID-19, which further improves our overall margins. 
In total, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 15.8%. 
The effective tax rate is 26%, which is at the lower end of the range we anticipated in January. That excludes discrete tax benefits of $43 million or $0.08 per share in the first quarter. 
Now let me discuss the individual segment's results for the first quarter beginning on Slide 11. For Construction Industries, sales increased by 27% to $5.5 billion compared to the prior year. 
Volume improved due to higher end-user demand and the impact from increases in dealer inventories. 
End-user demand increased across all regions and was especially pronounced in Asia/Pacific. This was led by China, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 while supported in the first quarter of this year by government infrastructure spend. 
In North America, high end-user demand was primarily fueled by residential construction. 
In total, dealers increased inventories by more this quarter compared to the prior year, principally in the Asia/Pacific region, which benefited from a later Chinese New Year. 
The segment's first quarter profit increased by 62% to $1.035 billion due to the leverage on higher sales volume. Unfavorable price realization reflected geographic mix as the mix of sales shifted towards the Asia/Pacific region. This and the impact of reinstating our short-term incentive plan partly offset the volume benefits. The segment operating margin increased by 410 basis points to 19%.  
As shown on Slide 12, Resource Industries sales increased by 6% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion. The most significant drivers were changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. 
End-user demand increases were driven by mining. Commodity prices, coupled with increased mine site activity, were both supportive. Demand in heavy construction and quarrying aggregates remained subdued. Sales increased in Latin America and EAME, were about flat in Asia/Pacific and decreased in North America. 
The segment's first quarter profit increased by 8% to $328 million. The improvement was mainly due to lower manufacturing costs and higher sales volumes. Manufacturing costs reflected benefits from cost absorption, lower warranty cost expense and improvements in efficiency. 
Price realization was a partial offset in the quarter due to several large strategic deals. These deals support a higher fuel population and services growth in the future, making them attractive over the long term. These benefits were partly offset by the impact of reinstating our short-term incentive plan. The segment's operating margin rose by 20 basis points to 14.8%.  
Now turning to Slide 13. First quarter sales of Energy & Transportation increased by 4% to $4.5 billion. That included a 6% sales increase in oil and gas, largely due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts in North America. Power generation sales improved by 13% due to increased sales for turbines and turbine-related services as well as large reciprocating engine applications as data center activity remained strong. Industrial sales were about flat. Transportation declined by 12%, mostly due to lower deliveries of locomotives and related services in North America as well as lower activity in marine. 
E&T's first quarter profit increased by 11% to $666 million. The improvement was led by higher sales volume, including intersegment sales and favorable variable manufacturing costs. That was partially offset by the impact of short-term incentive compensation expense. The segment's operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 14.8%.  
As Jim mentioned, we closed on our acquisition of SPM Oil & Gas in early February and the integration is going well. The impact was not material to either sales or earnings for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue decreased by $53 million or 7% to $761 million. The decline was due to lower average financing rates and lower average earning assets in North America. 
However, segment profit improved on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Segment profit of $244 million increased 132% year-over-year led by the mark-to-market impact on equity securities in our insurance services portfolio, in addition to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. The provision was favorable due to, in part, the absence of forecasted COVID-19-related impacts, which reduced our allowance for credit losses. Beyond these impacts, Financial Products profit was relatively flat in the quarter. 
Past dues at the end of the first quarter were 2.9%, down 123 basis points year-over-year and down 59 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Credit applications remained strong as well, up 25% compared with the first quarter of 2020. While credit applications in the first quarter decreased compared to the fourth quarter, the sequential reduction was much smaller than normal seasonality would suggest, which bodes well for the future. Loan modifications were generally in line with historical trends aside from a few countries where government -- the government is still mandating modifications due to COVID-19. We're pleased to see that, overall, our customers remained in good financial health. 
Now on Slide 15. As Jim mentioned, we expect to achieve our Investor Day target for Machinery, Energy & Transportation free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion this year. Free cash flow from ME&T was about $1.7 billion in the quarter versus about 0 in the first quarter last year. The increase reflects higher profit, the absence of a short-term incentive compensation payout and favorable working capital, the latter being due to higher payables. 
In the first quarter, Caterpillar inventory rose about $700 million versus the fourth quarter as we increased production to meet improving end-user demand. We are happy with our decision to hold higher levels of inventory as we exited 2020 as this has enabled us to ramp up production in the first quarter to meet our demand signals. 
As Jim said, there is potential for supply chain disruptions and cost pressures on the horizon and we're working hard to meet those challenges. 
We maintained a strong liquidity position and ended the first quarter with $11.3 billion in enterprise cash. 
Our balance sheet remained strong. We now have mid-A credit ratings across all of the major rating agencies as Moody's upgraded its rating on Caterpillar last week. 
Our intention continues to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles via dividends and share repurchases. In the last 3 years, we have returned 106% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. 
We recently declared our normal quarterly on dividend of $1.03 per share or $560 million per quarter. We expect the Board will review a potential dividend increase later this year. 
We also expect to recommence share repurchases later this year. 
We are not providing guidance for 2021, and I'll explain the reason why. At the current time, we are positive about the improving market conditions. On the other hand, there are some known risks, which are hard to quantify and the impact of such to the range of possible outcomes for 2021, while still positive, is actually quite wide at the stage of the year. 
Turning to Slide 16. Overall, we expect second quarter sales to follow normal seasonality. We also expect overall growth in sales to users versus the prior year's quarterly comparative to be a significantly higher percentage than we saw in the first quarter. That is mainly due to easier comparisons. 
A reminder that the second and third quarters saw the biggest impacts from the pandemic on total sales to users in 2020. 
We also don't expect to see a significant change in dealer inventories compared to the end of the first quarter of this year. 
In Construction Industries, we expect sales to users to show continued positive growth as strength in residential construction in North America continues. Nonresidential construction is expected to recover at a gradual pace throughout the year. We expect China construction to remain strong, although the comparators with China become more challenging in the second half of 2021 versus the prior year as China recovered more quickly from the effects of the pandemic. 
We expect strong end-user demand in Resource Industries compared to the prior year's quarter as demand in both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates are expected to increase due to supported commodity prices and the restart of investments that were delayed last year. We expect to see continued improvement in end-user demand over the rest of the year as orders are strong amidst increasing minor CapEx spend. We also expect the recovery of heavy construction and quarry and aggregates from their low levels in 2020. 
We expect Energy & Transportation sales to increase versus the second quarter of 2020. We expect oil and gas sales to have a slight growth, but customers will remain disciplined with CapEx. Solar had a strong second quarter in 2020 due to the timing of deliveries, which will make the comparisons tougher. Power generation and industrial are expected to grow versus the prior year. We expect slight improvement in transportation sales. Marine should improve, but remain at low levels. And rail is expected to be relatively flat. 
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect a modest recovery through the year as sales in E&T increase across all applications. Recovery in oil and gas should be slower as excess capacity and inventory overhang could limit upside. 
In power generation, data centers should lead in an overall improving industry. Our expectations for solar have not changed, so we expect a relatively flat year. Industrial should grow moderately. Transportation should improve on strengthened rail services and international business, while expect marine to remain at lower levels. 
Dealer inventory remains near the low end of the normal range. Changes in dealer inventories going forward will depend on a number of factors, including their views of future demand as well as supply chain limitations. At this stage, we do not expect a significant benefit from restocking in 2021. 
As I discussed earlier, first quarter adjusted operating margins were particularly strong, improving by 230 basis points despite the impact of reinstating short-term incentive compensation. There are a number of reasons why we expect the margin improvement to moderate as we go through the second quarter and the rest of the year. 
We saw positive material costs in the first quarter as the benefits of holding more inventory in 2020 flowed through the P&L. With the supply chain pressures and rising commodity costs, we expect material costs to become a headwind starting with the second quarter. 
Freight costs were negative in the quarter. The constraints on freight are well known and will continue to impact us as we go through the year. Specific to the second quarter, we do expect absorption to be a headwind as we built Caterpillar inventory in the first quarter ahead of the selling season. 
On the other side of the equation, we expect price to become favorable as we go through the year as geographic mix improves and the impact of price increases increasingly flow through, particularly in the second half. 
SG&A and R&D expenses increased in the first quarter due to short-term incentive compensation expense. As we progress through the year, we expect spend in these areas to accelerate. COVID-related restrictions, on things like travel are impacting spend, and we are also anticipating ramping up R&D project spending to support our services growth strategy as well as new product development. Investments in R&D can be comfortably managed within our Investor Day margin targets. 
As Jim mentioned, we remain positive, but we're diligently monitoring the risks and their potential impact going forward. It's a fluid situation in terms of potential supply challenges, raw material cost pressures and pandemic-related concerns, areas where we have varying levels of control. Our aim is to minimize the impact of these factors and maximize factory uptime so we can satisfy improving customer demand. 
Looking at some of our technical guidance, we had approximately $350 million in restructuring expense in 2020 and we still expect about $400 million in restructuring expense for 2021. The headwind from incentive compensation will now be approximately $325 million per quarter versus the $225 million estimated in January. 
We now anticipate a tax rate of 26% for the full year, which is at the lower end of our prior range. 
Our estimate for CapEx this year remains about $1.3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 17. In summary, we expect to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margin and ME&T free cash flow in 2021. We continue to execute our strategy by investing in services and expanding offerings. These help us achieve a strong top line growth and solid margin expansion in our 3 primary segments as well as higher profits from Financial Products. 
It was a strong start to the year. There are some risks that we have to deal with as move forward, particularly around the supply chain, but we are positive about the year and our team's ability to meet improving customer demand.  
With that, we're happy to take questions."

And then talking about our overall margins, as I indicated a few moments ago, I mean, we actually saw material cost favorability in the first quarter. 
That's for a couple of reasons. Obviously, the inventory we hold at the end of 2020 flowed through the P&L now. And also, as we do buy steel forward, we have about a 3- to 6-month full contract normally on steel purchases. So we do expect material cost to move from positive to negative as we move forward. However, we are pricing accordingly And with geo mix as well becoming favorable, we hope to be able to offset the two. Obviously, there is continued risk, obviously on material inflation as we look out. 
Overall, though, as we always remind you, commodity increases are net positive for us at Caterpillar because it helps our customers buy more. 
On SG&A and R&D, spend was relatively low in Q1. Part of that, obviously -- although, obviously, we did have short-term incentive comp increases, part of that, obviously, is in the environment we're still working in. There's still ramping up going on in projects. Obviously, if you've got a new project -- we ended a lot of projects at the end of last year. Starting them becomes a lot more difficult in an environment where people aren't all together. We expect that to accelerate as we go through the year, that particularly will impact R&D spend. 
And then obviously, travel will impact SG&A as we get people back out on the road and people want to go out and meet customers, that will impact us as we go forward. So those are the sort of bits. 
As far as the top line is concerned, I mean, obviously, that's going to depend on, as we talked about, the ability to meet the demand profile out there and how actually customers feel as we go through the year. As we indicated, demand signals are improving. And obviously, that's going to be something we'll continue to monitor and may impact overall how the quarters trend out from a top line perspective."

There's a number of projects that we're tendering that are multi-year in nature. We feel very positive about our competitive position because of our autonomous solution across a number of products. 
So again, as I've talked about earlier, we're not expecting a very fast ramp-up or a spike. We're seeing more of a gradual improvement, and that's continuing. And so again, we're quite encouraged by what we see.

We talked about having 300 to 600 basis points better on operating margin regardless of where we were in that cycle compared to the historical past, which we defined as 2010 to 2016; and also producing $1 billion to $2 billion of incremental ME&T free cash flow at all points of the cycle.
So that's what really -- what we're really focused on. So again, as we sit here today, we are optimistic about what we see that things are improving in some markets that have been depressed. We've talked about the strength in mining. But again, it's just very difficult to try to judge what will happen 2 or 3 years out. There are so many factors that could impact it."

And obviously, that sets up a very positive '22 for your machine production even if retail sales were just flat.

As we close out the first half of 2021, I'd like to thank our global team for their strong performance in a challenging dynamic environment. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth and remain focused on the safety of our employees. We're encouraged by higher end year demand in the majority of our end markets. 
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I'll briefly cover 3 topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Caterpillar's second quarter results. I'll then review our end markets before discussing the sustainability report, including our new climate and energy statement that we published during the second quarter. 
On Slide 4, we're pleased with the strong sales and profit performance during the second quarter. Sales and revenues increased 29% primarily due to higher sales volume. The 2 main drivers of our top line were strong end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventory. Compared to the second quarter of last year, sales to users rose roughly 15% and changes in dealer inventories provided about a $1 billion tailwind. 
During our first quarter call, we mentioned that growth in sales to users would be significantly higher than the 8% we saw in the first quarter. Sales to users rose about 15% versus the second quarter of last year and trended better for the fourth consecutive quarter. We had gains in all 3 of our primary segments. 
Machines rose 20% with similar increases in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries with improved improvement in all regions. Demand from residential construction remained strong and demand related to nonresidential improved. Mining was also up. Quotation activity for miners remain strong, and we've seen a significant improvement in orders through the first 2 quarters. We were also pleased that heavy construction and aggregate strengthened as did several end markets within Energy & Transportation. 
Energy & Transportation sales to users turned positive, rising 1%. The Keep in mind that the slowdown in end user demand in 2020 affected Energy & Transportation later than the other segments as some of the applications are impacted by timing of large products. 
From a geographic perspective, we had strength in sales across all regions. North America was quite strong as expected. EMEA and Latin America also showed double-digit sales growth. Asia Pacific saw good growth in most areas outside of China. China declined modestly in the quarter after rebounding strongly beginning in the second quarter of 2020, leading to a tougher comparison. We also had modest benefits to sales this quarter from currency and price. 
As we noted in our first quarter call, second quarter 2020 saw a decline in dealer inventory of $1.4 billion. but we did not expect a significant change during 2021. Dealer inventory declined $400 million during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter of this year, dealer inventory remains near the low end of the normal range. 
I'll now provide an update on Caterpillar's supply chain. In spite of the unprecedented challenges impacting the industrial sector, I'm proud of the work by our team to minimize disruptions, which were relatively modest during the second quarter. For the majority of our products, availability remains within our normal ranges. We mentioned on the last earnings call that the supply chain situation, including transportation, was challenging and that our team was preparing contingency plans such as alternative assembly processes at our facilities. During the quarter, our team implemented some of those plans and continued to work closely with our suppliers to mitigate supply chain impacts on production. We still anticipate that supply chain challenges will remain throughout the year, and our goal is to minimize the impact on our ability to meet improving customer demand. In addition, as we mentioned during our last earnings call, we do not expect a significant benefit from dealer restocking during 2021. 
Operating profit in the second quarter increased 128% to $1.8 billion. Volume growth, price realization and strong results from Financial Products drove the improvement. We did have some favorable price flow-through this quarter, mostly in Construction Industries. We also saw higher short-term incentive compensation expense and some higher material costs including steel and other commodities as expected. Andrew will discuss margins in more detail. 
The adjusted operating profit margin improved to 14.1% versus 9.3% in the second quarter of 2020, as we expected. Operating margins increased in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries despite headwinds from short-term incentive compensation and supply chain challenges. Profit per share was $2.56 versus $0.84 in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share was $2.60 versus $1.27 in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 5. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was another highlight of the quarter. We generated $1.7 billion of ME&T free cash flow with higher profit partly offset by an increase in Caterpillar inventory. 
We resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. We also announced we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.11 per share. We paid a higher dividend annually for 27 consecutive years. We returned about $800 million to shareholders in the second quarter via the dividend and share repurchases. We expect to repurchase sufficient shares between now and the end of the year to at least offset absolute dilution from shares issued this year. 
In light of the highly fluid environment, we will continue our practice of not providing profit per share guidance. However, we'll share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter and the full year. For 2021, as we said on the last earnings call, we expect to achieve the targets for adjusted operating profit margin that we set out at our 2019 Investor Day of 300 to 600 basis points of improvement versus our performance during the 2010 to 2016 period at similar sales -- similar levels of sales and revenues. We also expect to achieve the free cash flow targets we set for ME&T at Investor Day of an incremental $1 billion to $2 billion at all points in the cycle. Andrew will elaborate with a few of our assumptions for the upcoming quarter in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll walk through our expectations by end market. Overall, we're becoming more optimistic about our end markets since our last earnings call. We're pleased that many end markets continue to improve and demand continues to strengthen. Global demand is strong and the outlook is positive. 
In Construction Industries, for example, we're optimistic about the industry as we expect end market demand to show continued positive growth. Residential and nonresidential construction demand is expected to remain strong led by North America. In China, we expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to be about flat in 2021 compared to a very strong 2020. Please keep in mind that demand was very strong in this market during the first quarter. Our newly introduced GX models continue to perform well, and we're still receiving positive customer feedback. In the balance of Asia Pacific, we believe stronger-than-expected commodity prices, housing strength and government infrastructure expenditures will support continued sales growth. In the EAME we see end market demand regaining momentum on strong construction activity higher commodity prices and improved confidence. Latin America should also show continued strengthening due to increased construction activity. 
Switching to Resource Industries. In mining, we continue to expect improvement in minor CapEx as commodity prices remain supportive of growth. Parked large mining trucks decreased in the quarter and remain at relatively low levels in all regions as utilization increases. Customer interest in Caterpillar's autonomous mining solution remains high and customers now autonomously operate or are deploying CAT machines on 18 sites around the world. While our mining customers continue to display capital discipline, we expect mining to continue to improve over the long term as the energy transition drives higher demand for commodities. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we've seen improvement in the second quarter, particularly in North America and the EAME. We expect continued strengthening in this part of the portfolio. 
Finally, in Energy & Transportation, we expect oil and gas to continue to strengthen gradually. We expect customers to continue to demonstrate capital discipline, and pockets of excess capacity remain. In power generation, strength in data center should continue. Industrial demand is expected to improve along with the global economic recovery. Transportation should see strength in rail services and growth in international deliveries for locomotives. In, marine demand is projected to grow modestly, while remaining at low levels. 
Now on Slide 7. Since our last quarterly earnings call, we published our 2020 sustainability report to establish and report progress against our environmental, social and governance goals. We also released a new climate and energy statement. Caterpillar shares the concerns of governments and the public about the risks of climate change and supports global efforts to mitigate its impact. We are committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future. 
This commitment is reflected in our sustainability vision to improve the quality of the environment and our communities. Some of the ways we do this are by further reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and helping customers meet their climate-related objectives by investing in innovative new products, technologies and services. 
Our 2020 sustainability report highlights 7 new environmental, social and governance goals we've set to achieve by 2030. These goals, which address issues most relevant to our customers and other stakeholders, are focused on the climate and environment in addition to safety. One of these goals is to ensure that 100% of Caterpillar's new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. 
It's an inspiring time to be a Caterpillar employee. I'm pleased with all the good work already underway across the company. We're developing products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increased operational efficiency and reduced emissions to help communities thrive and to help our customers achieve their environmental goals. By establishing and reporting progress on our ESG targets, we provide transparency about our progress and innovation. In order to further increase transparency, we will strive to provide an update, for example, during our earnings calls. 
This quarter, I'll close with an example. Recently, Nouveau Monde Graphite, or NMG, announced a collaboration with us to fully power their Matawinie  graphite mine with zero emissions machines by 2028. Caterpillar will be the exclusive equipment, technology and service provider for NMG. We'll be developing, testing and producing cat zero-emission machines for the project in Saint-Michel-des-Saints in Quebec, Canada. 
In conclusion, we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth by investing in services, expanding our offerings and improving operational excellence. It was a strong quarter from a financial and operational perspective and a good first half. Looking forward, we're optimistic about our ability to mitigate supply chain challenges and are encouraged by customer demand that's strengthening and is broad-based across all regions. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
259378,1674249906,2356434,"Caterpillar Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Caterpillar Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking you through second quarter results, including some color on the segment performance. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and our thoughts for the third quarter. Beginning on Slide 8. As J",2333,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking you through second quarter results, including some color on the segment performance. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and our thoughts for the third quarter. 
Beginning on Slide 8. As Jim noted, sales for the second quarter increased by 29% to $12.9 billion due to higher volumes. Operating profit of $1.8 billion increased by 128%, reflecting margin expansion primarily due to higher volumes. Second quarter profit per share was $2.56 compared with $0.84 in 2020. Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to $2.60 compared with $1.27 last year. 
I'll start with the top line on Slide 9, where we continue to see strong volume gains. Sales and revenue growth was in the double digits percent for all 3 of our primary segments and on a consolidated basis for every region. Growth in North America, our largest region, is up 30%, reflecting strong results in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Growth in the EAME was also robust, up 33%. Latin America rose by 67%, albeit off a low base, and Asia Pacific sales grew by 12%. 
Overall, sales to users increased by 15%. The acceleration from the 8% rate of growth in the first quarter was in line with our expectations of a significantly higher percentage as we discussed last quarter. Sales to users in Construction Industries rose by 20% led by North America. Residential construction continued to be strong in North America and EAME. Nonresidential construction in North America is recovering well as well. Latin America showed very good growth in sales to users off a low base. Asia Pacific was lower due to a modest decline in China. As Jim mentioned, the Chinese market started to recover earlier in 2020 than other countries, leading to a tougher comparative. Overall, we still expect China to have another strong year with the industry in the above 10 tonne excavator market about flat retaining last year's large gain. 
Sales to users in Resource Industries increased by 21%, reflecting growth from heavy construction and quarrying aggregates. Demand for equipment and mining also improved this quarter. And as Jim mentioned, we remain encouraged about the upside potential in mining. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users rose by 1%, in positive territory, despite the fact that E&T sales to users were impacted to a lesser extent than other segments in the second quarter of last year due to the timing of large deals. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating profit increased to $1.8 billion. The 128% improvement reflected higher volume in our 3 primary segments, favorable price and higher profits from financial products. That was partly offset by the impact of restoring short-term incentive compensation. 
The assumption for short-term incentive compensation in the quarter was also raised by about $100 million compared to the first quarter to reflect our strengthening results. We now expect our full year -- to be about $1.5 billion. This quarter, we had $25 million in restructuring expense, over $100 million lower than a year ago. We now expect around $250 million in restructuring expenses this year. We also had a full quarter impact of SPM Oil & Gas, including some M&A-related costs which I'll cover in a bit more detail when we discuss Energy & Transportation. 
The adjusted operating profit margin rose 480 basis points to 14.1%. As we expected, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses rose. These increases reflected not only the impact of incentive compensation but also investments in key priorities such as growing services and investing in product development to help our customers achieve their climate objectives. 
As we explained in April, we did expect a sequential decline in margins versus the first quarter. Margins were broadly in line with our expectations. As we said, price realization turned positive in the quarter, while material and freight costs were a negative. We did see a lower margin reduction than expected from absorption as production rates remain strong. However, the increase in short-term incentive compensation more than offset that. 
The global tax rate remains about 26%. Adjusted profit per share of $2.60 excludes $0.04 of restructuring expense versus $0.24 of restructuring expense as well as $0.19 for the settlement of pension obligations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. Let's take a look at segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 40% to $5.7 billion primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to higher end user demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in end user demand was led by North America, where residential construction remained strong and nonresidential construction strengthened. Overall, dealers reduced their construction equipment inventories less than the second quarter of 2021 than in the second quarter of 2020. 
The segment's second quarter profit increased by 98% to $1 billion. The near doubling came from higher sales volume and favorable price realization, including geographic mix. Cost absorption and efficiencies were positive in the quarter. That was partly offset by 2 items: the impact to short-term incentive compensation, and we started to see the impact of unfavorable material costs, although this was modest in the quarter. The segment operating margin increased by 530 basis points to 18.1%. 
Turning to Slide 12, Resource Industries sales increased by 41% in the second quarter to $2.6 billion. The increase was mostly due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and changes in dealer inventories. As we expected, heavy construction and quarry and aggregates began to improve, and we expect continued improvement from here. End user demand and mining also continued to improve. Sales were up in all regions. Second quarter profit for Resource Industries more than doubled, increasing by 138% to $361 million. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume partially offset by the impact of our short-term incentive compensation expense. 
Price was slightly negative mostly due to changes in prices for Australian dollar-denominated aftermarket parts. These were reduced to reflect currency movements versus the U.S. dollar. The operating margin increased by 570 basis points to 14%. 
Now on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 20% to $5 billion. That included an 11% sales increase in oil and gas, largely due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts, driven in part by the addition of SPM Oil & Gas. Power generation sales improved by 18%, reflecting increased sales for large reciprocating engine applications primarily for data centers. Industrial sales increased by 33% with demand across all regions. Transportation rose by 10% on higher rail services and marine sales. 
Profit for E&T increased by 17% to $731 million. The improvement was due to the higher sales volume. That was partially offset by a couple of factors, including the impact of short-term incentive compensation and acquisition-related expenses primarily for SPM Oil & Gas. Higher freight costs were offset by manufacturing efficiencies. The segment's operating margin declined by 30 basis points to 14.7%. With regards to SPM Oil and gas, we do expect this to be a modest drag on margins for E&T for the remainder of the year. This was the first full quarter since the acquisition, and it will take some time for the synergies to be realized. We're very pleased with the acquisition and expect to see the full benefits of the acquisition as we move forward. 
On Slide 14, Financial Products revenue increased by 1% to $774 million as the portfolio remained relatively constant. Segment profit remained strong, increasing by 64% year-over-year to $243 million, which was about flat compared to the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year profit increase was due to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial compared to the year ago quarter, which reflected the absence of forecast of COVID-19-related impacts. 
In addition, we had a higher net yield on average earning assets due to a favorable change in weighted average interest rates and a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment benefiting from higher demand for used equipment. 
Our credit portfolio remains in good shape as indicators of customer health are all positive. Past dues continued to improve to 2.58%, down 116 basis points year-on-year and down 32 basis points compared to the first quarter. Credit applications remained strong as well, up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9% compared to the first quarter. New business volume continues to trend up, led by North America. Requests for loan modifications have returned to historical trends. 
Moving to Slide 15. We're confident that, in 2021, we'll achieve our Investor Day target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion. ME&T free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the second quarter compared to $500 million last year. The increase in ME&T free cash flow reflected higher profit, offset in part by a $500 million sequential increase in Caterpillar inventory in the second quarter of 2021. The inventory increase is primarily in components and work-in-process inventory and reflects strengthening end-user demand and our response to supply chain challenges. 
ME&T free cash flow has been $3.4 billion year-to-date, benefiting from higher profits as well as the absence of paying short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position in support of our strong mid-day credit rating. The company ended the period with $10.8 billion of enterprise cash. 
We've said that we intend to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. We've said that we will do it through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, preserving our balance sheet to fund additional growth initiatives and mergers and acquisitions. 
In the past 3 years, we've returned on average 106% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. This quarter, we announced we'll increase our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.11 per share, which is about $600 million a quarter. I'm happy to say we expect to extend our status as a dividend aristocrat for another year. 
We repurchased about $250 million of our common shares this quarter. We have about $4.6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second half and intend to at least offset absolute dilution from shares issued during the year. 
As Jim mentioned, there's no change to our current practice relating to guidance. However, as we've been doing, we are providing color on the upcoming quarter to give you a sense of what we're expecting to happen. 
Moving to Slide 16. Again, we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins in 2021 despite reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program. That's now projected to be a headwind of $1.5 billion for the year or about 300 basis points of pressure on margins. We expect stronger sales than normal seasonality would imply. The growth rate in sales to users should continue to accelerate in the third quarter when compared to the prior year and should be significantly higher than the 15% rate we saw in the current quarter. 
In Construction Industries, we expect improvement in residential and nonresidential construction demand to continue. As we discussed last quarter, we see tougher comparisons in China. Resource Industries end user demand should see support from both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. We also expect Energy & Transportation sales to increase on stronger underlying demand. All of this is expected to lead to good volume growth in the third quarter, even while we manage supply chain challenges. As we told you last quarter, and as Jim mentioned today, whilst dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions about their inventory, we don't expect a significant benefit from restocking in 2021. 
Third quarter margins are expected to be stronger than the prior year with leverage from strong volume more than offsetting the impact of green stating short-term incentive compensation. However, we anticipate third quarter margins to moderate versus the second quarter as we see some cost headwinds in the second half of the year. Within machines, we currently expect price to offset higher manufacturing costs in 2021. 
In the second quarter, price was strongly positive, reflecting strong geographic mix benefits and higher price realization. We did put through price increases from machines at the end of the second quarter, which will be positive, but geographic mix will be less of a benefit. Although we did take pricing actions, we do expect higher manufacturing costs, which means that our gross margin percentage will be moderately lower in the second half of the year versus the first half. 
We should also see accelerated spend in SG&A and R&D in the back half of the year as business gets back to normal. Specifically within Energy & Transportation, we expect some margin headwinds in the second half of the year. As E&T is a lumpy business with varying margin structures across these applications, we expect variability in both price and mix, particularly as larger deals were recognized into revenue. 
In addition, as many of the E&T applications are expecting -- experiencing different levels of demand, we did not put through additional price increases in the second half -- second quarter. So this means material and freight cost increases will be a headwind for that segment. 
In summary, on Slide 17. Demand continued to strengthen in the quarter, leading to strong volume growth. Adjusted operating profit margins improved by 480 basis points driven by higher volumes, which more than offset the nearly 300 basis headwind of short-term incentive compensation and the small headwinds of supply chain disruption and material cost inflation. 
Adjusted profit per share more than doubled in the quarter. We are confident in the outlook for our own markets and expect to achieve our Investor Day margin and free cash flow targets. And with that, we'll take your questions."

And first, we really appreciate the efforts of our employees to manage the challenges in the supply chain. And one of the things that we're seeing, of course, is improving end-user demand is adding pressure in the supply chain and on freight as well. And some of the supply chain challenges are more broad-based that occurs in a normal upturn. I mean you think about the last upturn, we had casting issues and some other individual component issues. This time, it's more broad-based than is typical. 
Having said that, again, as we said in the last call, our team is working very hard to avoid or minimize those supply chain challenges that would impact our ability to meet -- to fully meet improving customer demand. We think that the impact to the second quarter was modest. And again, we're working very hard to try to limit them. We haven't had some of the large factory shutdowns for weeks that you've read about with some other industrial companies. 
We've also taken some actions to do things like, with resins, we changed our material spec due to shortages that were out there, and that helped us keep production going. Again, the majority of our products for end users are delivered within the normal range of availability. Some of the bigger challenges have been on the smaller products, BCP. A lot of those products are used in residential in North America. So those are some of the bigger challenges we're having in terms of availability. But again, the majority of our products for our end users are within the normal ranges. And we're working very closely with our dealers to try to ensure that we meet actual customer demand."

You mentioned autonomy and the demand for autonomous products continues to be quite strong, a lot of quotation activity going on.

And so again, we believe that will continue to grow at a rapid pace. We're also expanding our autonomous solutions to other support equipment like dozers, drills, underground equipment and water trucks as well. 
In terms of zero emissions products, we're very focused and working closely with our customers to meet their needs. We talked about the NMG announcement during the call here already this morning. That's a great example of one where a customer has a need. They have a date they have to meet, and we're working very closely with them as their exclusive supplier with product and technologies to make it happen. So again, we're working very closely to develop products to meet customer demand. And as you can imagine, it's a big topic of discussion and focus by our leadership team and something we'll continue to do moving forward. 
And some of the goals we put out in our sustainability report, we talked about 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation in some manner, and we're very focused on doing that. So again, if you look at our Climate and Energy statement, it talks more about some of our approaches and our specific goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations.

As far as the margin, yes, E&T will moderate. That's an impact, as we said, of not putting price through. Within CI and RI within the machines businesses, obviously, we've seen price benefit. Part of that price benefit is geo mix. Geo mix will come off a little bit. So there will be an offset between geo-mix and price, and that's really due to the mix of sales between the different geographies, which impacts geo-mix. So price won't improve, but obviously, you will start seeing some material cost increases and probably some increasing freight costs based on what we're seeing in the market today.

And most of that is obviously -- if you remember last year, when we looked at geo mix, there was a big move between -- obviously, China in the second half of the year was very strong recovery. The U.S., we saw inventory reductions and softer demand. So there was a negative drag on geo mix. 
First quarter, obviously, China was very strong in CI. The U.S. is slightly weaker. Obviously, now in the second quarter, we've seen that turn around quite significantly, and that gave us a big benefit of geo mix in Q2. That will moderate because the [ relative ] gap of North America versus the other geographies will actually diminish. So that's how it works, and that's why we think it will actually still be a benefit but will be less positive than it was in Q2. However, we do expect the price increases we put through to offset that. So we'll see other price realization mitigate that impact."

So it is a moving part. There's lots of bits of moving parts within there. Absorption rates have an impact and so forth as well. So overall, though, yes, they are increasing. They are pressured. However, probably, we don't see -- it's more that we saw such strong favorability. Remember, Q1, we actually had material costs -- manufacturing costs were favorable. And also, we saw very minimal price. We saw stronger price in Q2, and the small increase in manufacturing costs. That just means that the manufacturing cost will get greater and more sort of mitigate, offset some of that price we've seen. So that gives you a sort of range to work to."

As we close out the first half of 2021, I'd like to thank our global team for their strong performance in a challenging dynamic environment. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth and remain focused on the safety of our employees. We're encouraged by higher end year demand in the majority of our end markets. 
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I'll briefly cover 3 topics this morning. I'll share my perspectives on Caterpillar's second quarter results. I'll then review our end markets before discussing the sustainability report, including our new climate and energy statement that we published during the second quarter. 
On Slide 4, we're pleased with the strong sales and profit performance during the second quarter. Sales and revenues increased 29% primarily due to higher sales volume. The 2 main drivers of our top line were strong end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventory. Compared to the second quarter of last year, sales to users rose roughly 15% and changes in dealer inventories provided about a $1 billion tailwind. 
During our first quarter call, we mentioned that growth in sales to users would be significantly higher than the 8% we saw in the first quarter. Sales to users rose about 15% versus the second quarter of last year and trended better for the fourth consecutive quarter. We had gains in all 3 of our primary segments. 
Machines rose 20% with similar increases in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries with improved improvement in all regions. Demand from residential construction remained strong and demand related to nonresidential improved. Mining was also up. Quotation activity for miners remain strong, and we've seen a significant improvement in orders through the first 2 quarters. We were also pleased that heavy construction and aggregate strengthened as did several end markets within Energy & Transportation. 
Energy & Transportation sales to users turned positive, rising 1%. The Keep in mind that the slowdown in end user demand in 2020 affected Energy & Transportation later than the other segments as some of the applications are impacted by timing of large products. 
From a geographic perspective, we had strength in sales across all regions. North America was quite strong as expected. EMEA and Latin America also showed double-digit sales growth. Asia Pacific saw good growth in most areas outside of China. China declined modestly in the quarter after rebounding strongly beginning in the second quarter of 2020, leading to a tougher comparison. We also had modest benefits to sales this quarter from currency and price. 
As we noted in our first quarter call, second quarter 2020 saw a decline in dealer inventory of $1.4 billion. but we did not expect a significant change during 2021. Dealer inventory declined $400 million during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter of this year, dealer inventory remains near the low end of the normal range. 
I'll now provide an update on Caterpillar's supply chain. In spite of the unprecedented challenges impacting the industrial sector, I'm proud of the work by our team to minimize disruptions, which were relatively modest during the second quarter. For the majority of our products, availability remains within our normal ranges. We mentioned on the last earnings call that the supply chain situation, including transportation, was challenging and that our team was preparing contingency plans such as alternative assembly processes at our facilities. During the quarter, our team implemented some of those plans and continued to work closely with our suppliers to mitigate supply chain impacts on production. We still anticipate that supply chain challenges will remain throughout the year, and our goal is to minimize the impact on our ability to meet improving customer demand. In addition, as we mentioned during our last earnings call, we do not expect a significant benefit from dealer restocking during 2021. 
Operating profit in the second quarter increased 128% to $1.8 billion. Volume growth, price realization and strong results from Financial Products drove the improvement. We did have some favorable price flow-through this quarter, mostly in Construction Industries. We also saw higher short-term incentive compensation expense and some higher material costs including steel and other commodities as expected. Andrew will discuss margins in more detail. 
The adjusted operating profit margin improved to 14.1% versus 9.3% in the second quarter of 2020, as we expected. Operating margins increased in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries despite headwinds from short-term incentive compensation and supply chain challenges. Profit per share was $2.56 versus $0.84 in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share was $2.60 versus $1.27 in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 5. Free cash flow from Machinery, Energy & Transportation was another highlight of the quarter. We generated $1.7 billion of ME&T free cash flow with higher profit partly offset by an increase in Caterpillar inventory. 
We resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. We also announced we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.11 per share. We paid a higher dividend annually for 27 consecutive years. We returned about $800 million to shareholders in the second quarter via the dividend and share repurchases. We expect to repurchase sufficient shares between now and the end of the year to at least offset absolute dilution from shares issued this year. 
In light of the highly fluid environment, we will continue our practice of not providing profit per share guidance. However, we'll share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter and the full year. For 2021, as we said on the last earnings call, we expect to achieve the targets for adjusted operating profit margin that we set out at our 2019 Investor Day of 300 to 600 basis points of improvement versus our performance during the 2010 to 2016 period at similar sales -- similar levels of sales and revenues. We also expect to achieve the free cash flow targets we set for ME&T at Investor Day of an incremental $1 billion to $2 billion at all points in the cycle. Andrew will elaborate with a few of our assumptions for the upcoming quarter in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll walk through our expectations by end market. Overall, we're becoming more optimistic about our end markets since our last earnings call. We're pleased that many end markets continue to improve and demand continues to strengthen. Global demand is strong and the outlook is positive. 
In Construction Industries, for example, we're optimistic about the industry as we expect end market demand to show continued positive growth. Residential and nonresidential construction demand is expected to remain strong led by North America. In China, we expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to be about flat in 2021 compared to a very strong 2020. Please keep in mind that demand was very strong in this market during the first quarter. Our newly introduced GX models continue to perform well, and we're still receiving positive customer feedback. In the balance of Asia Pacific, we believe stronger-than-expected commodity prices, housing strength and government infrastructure expenditures will support continued sales growth. In the EAME, we see end market demand regaining momentum on strong construction activity, higher commodity prices and improved confidence. Latin America should also show continued strengthening due to increased construction activity. 
Switching to Resource Industries. In mining, we continue to expect improvement in minor CapEx as commodity prices remain supportive of growth. Parked large mining trucks decreased in the quarter and remain at relatively low levels in all regions as utilization increases. Customer interest in Caterpillar's autonomous mining solution remains high and customers now autonomously operate or are deploying CAT machines on 18 sites around the world. While our mining customers continue to display capital discipline, we expect mining to continue to improve over the long term as the energy transition drives higher demand for commodities. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we've seen improvement in the second quarter, particularly in North America and the EAME. We expect continued strengthening in this part of the portfolio. 
Finally, in Energy & Transportation, we expect oil and gas to continue to strengthen gradually. We expect customers to continue to demonstrate capital discipline, and pockets of excess capacity remain. In power generation, strength in data center should continue. Industrial demand is expected to improve along with the global economic recovery. Transportation should see strength in rail services and growth in international deliveries for locomotives. In, marine demand is projected to grow modestly, while remaining at low levels. 
Now on Slide 7. Since our last quarterly earnings call, we published our 2020 sustainability report to establish and report progress against our environmental, social and governance goals. We also released a new climate and energy statement. Caterpillar shares the concerns of governments and the public about the risks of climate change and supports global efforts to mitigate its impact. We are committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future. 
This commitment is reflected in our sustainability vision to improve the quality of the environment and our communities. Some of the ways we do this are by further reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and helping customers meet their climate-related objectives by investing in innovative new products, technologies and services. 
Our 2020 sustainability report highlights 7 new environmental, social and governance goals we've set to achieve by 2030. These goals, which address issues most relevant to our customers and other stakeholders, are focused on the climate and environment in addition to safety. One of these goals is to ensure that 100% of Caterpillar's new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation. 
It's an inspiring time to be a Caterpillar employee. I'm pleased with all the good work already underway across the company. We're developing products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increased operational efficiency and reduced emissions to help communities thrive and to help our customers achieve their environmental goals. By establishing and reporting progress on our ESG targets, we provide transparency about our progress and innovation. In order to further increase transparency, we will strive to provide an update, for example, during our earnings calls. 
This quarter, I'll close with an example. Recently, Nouveau Monde Graphite, or NMG, announced a collaboration with us to fully power their Matawinie  graphite mine with zero-emissions machines by 2028. Caterpillar will be the exclusive equipment, technology and service provider for NMG. We'll be developing, testing and producing CAT zero-emission machines for the project in Saint-Michel-des-Saints in Quebec, Canada. 
In conclusion, we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth by investing in services, expanding our offerings and improving operational excellence. It was a strong quarter from a financial and operational perspective and a good first half. Looking forward, we're optimistic about our ability to mitigate supply chain challenges and are encouraged by customer demand that's strengthening and is broad-based across all regions. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and our thoughts for the third quarter. 
Beginning on Slide 8. As Jim noted, sales for the second quarter increased by 29% to $12.9 billion due to higher volumes. Operating profit of $1.8 billion increased by 128%, reflecting margin expansion primarily due to higher volumes. Second quarter profit per share was $2.56 compared with $0.84 in 2020. Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to $2.60 compared with $1.27 last year. 
I'll start with the top line on Slide 9, where we continue to see strong volume gains. Sales and revenue growth was in the double digits percent for all 3 of our primary segments and on a consolidated basis for every region. Growth in North America, our largest region, is up 30%, reflecting strong results in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Growth in the EAME was also robust, up 33%. Latin America rose by 67%, albeit off a low base, and Asia Pacific sales grew by 12%. 
Overall, sales to users increased by 15%. The acceleration from the 8% rate of growth in the first quarter was in line with our expectations of a significantly higher percentage as we discussed last quarter. Sales to users in Construction Industries rose by 20% led by North America. Residential construction continued to be strong in North America and EAME. Nonresidential construction in North America is recovering well as well. Latin America showed very good growth in sales to users off a low base. Asia Pacific was lower due to a modest decline in China. As Jim mentioned, the Chinese market started to recover earlier in 2020 than other countries, leading to a tougher comparative. Overall, we still expect China to have another strong year with the industry in the above 10 tonne excavator market about flat retaining last year's large gain. 
Sales to users in Resource Industries increased by 21%, reflecting growth from heavy construction and quarrying aggregates. Demand for equipment and mining also improved this quarter. And as Jim mentioned, we remain encouraged about the upside potential in mining. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users rose by 1%, in positive territory, despite the fact that E&T sales to users were impacted to a lesser extent than other segments in the second quarter of last year due to the timing of large deals. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Operating profit increased to $1.8 billion. The 128% improvement reflected higher volume in our 3 primary segments, favorable price and higher profits from financial products. That was partly offset by the impact of restoring short-term incentive compensation. 
The assumption for short-term incentive compensation in the quarter was also raised by about $100 million compared to the first quarter to reflect our strengthening results. We now expect our full year  charge to be about $1.5 billion. This quarter, we had $25 million in restructuring expense, over $100 million lower than a year ago. We now expect around $250 million in restructuring expenses this year. We also had a full quarter impact of SPM Oil & Gas, including some M&A-related costs, which I'll cover in a bit more detail when we discuss Energy & Transportation. 
The adjusted operating profit margin rose 480 basis points to 14.1%. As we expected, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses rose. These increases reflected not only the impact of incentive compensation but also investments in key priorities such as growing services and investing in product development to help our customers achieve their climate objectives. 
As we explained in April, we did expect a sequential decline in margins versus the first quarter. Margins were broadly in line with our expectations. As we said, price realization turned positive in the quarter, while material and freight costs were a negative. We did see a lower margin reduction than expected from absorption as production rates remain strong. However, the increase in short-term incentive compensation more than offset that. 
The global tax rate remains about 26%. Adjusted profit per share of $2.60 excludes $0.04 of restructuring expense versus $0.24 of restructuring expense as well as $0.19 for the settlement of pension obligations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. Let's take a look at segment performance, starting with Construction Industry. Sales increased by 40% to $5.7 billion, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to higher end-user demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in end-user demand was led by North America, where residential construction remained strong and nonresidential construction strengthened. Overall, dealers reduced their construction equipment inventories less than the second quarter of 2021 than in the second quarter of 2020. 
The segment's second quarter profit increased by 98% to $1 billion. The near doubling came from higher sales volume and favorable price realization, including geographic mix. Cost absorption and efficiencies were positive in the quarter. That was partly offset by 2 items: the impact to short-term incentive compensation, and we started to see the impact of unfavorable material costs, although this was modest in the quarter. The segment operating margin increased by 530 basis points to 18.1%. 
Turning to Slide 12, Resource Industries sales increased by 41% in the second quarter to $2.6 billion. The increase was mostly due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and changes in dealer inventories. As we expected, heavy construction and quarry and aggregates began to improve, and we expect continued improvement from here. End user demand and mining also continued to improve. Sales were up in all regions. Second quarter profit for Resource Industries more than doubled, increasing by 138% to $361 million. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume partially offset by the impact of our short-term incentive compensation expense. 
Price was slightly negative mostly due to changes in prices for Australian dollar-denominated aftermarket parts. These were reduced to reflect currency movements versus the U.S. dollar. The operating margin increased by 570 basis points to 14%. 
Now on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 20% to $5 billion. That included an 11% sales increase in oil and gas, largely due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts, driven in part by the addition of SPM Oil & Gas. Power generation sales improved by 18%, reflecting increased sales for large reciprocating engine applications primarily for data centers. Industrial sales increased by 33% with demand across all regions. Transportation rose by 10% on higher rail services and marine sales. 
Profit for E&T increased by 17% to $731 million. The improvement was due to the higher sales volume. That was partially offset by a couple of factors, including the impact of short-term incentive compensation and acquisition-related expenses primarily for SPM Oil & Gas. Higher freight costs were offset by manufacturing efficiencies. The segment's operating margin declined by 30 basis points to 14.7%. With regards to SPM Oil and gas, we do expect this to be a modest drag on margins for E&T for the remainder of the year. This was the first full quarter since the acquisition, and it will take some time for the synergies to be realized. We're very pleased with the acquisition and expect to see the full benefits of the acquisition as we move forward. 
On Slide 14, Financial Products revenue increased by 1% to $774 million as the portfolio remained relatively constant. Segment profit remained strong, increasing by 64% year-over-year to $243 million, which was about flat compared to the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year profit increase was due to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial compared to the year ago quarter, which reflected the absence of forecast of COVID-19-related impacts. 
In addition, we had a higher net yield on average earning assets due to a favorable change in weighted average interest rates and a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment benefiting from higher demand for used equipment. 
Our credit portfolio remains in good shape as indicators of customer health are all positive. Past dues continued to improve to 2.58%, down 116 basis points year-on-year and down 32 basis points compared to the first quarter. Credit applications remained strong as well, up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9% compared to the first quarter. New business volume continues to trend up, led by North America. Requests for loan modifications have returned to historical trends. 
Moving to Slide 15. We're confident that, in 2021, we'll achieve our Investor Day target for ME&T free cash flow of $4 billion to $8 billion. ME&T free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the second quarter compared to $500 million last year. The increase in ME&T free cash flow reflected higher profit, offset in part by a $500 million sequential increase in Caterpillar inventory in the second quarter of 2021. The inventory increase is primarily in components and work-in-process inventory and reflects strengthening end-user demand and our response to supply chain challenges. 
ME&T free cash flow has been $3.4 billion year-to-date, benefiting from higher profits as well as the absence of paying short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position in support of our strong mid-day credit rating. The company ended the period with $10.8 billion of enterprise cash. 
We've said that we intend to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles. We've said that we will do it through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, preserving our balance sheet to fund additional growth initiatives and mergers and acquisitions. 
In the past 3 years, we've returned on average 106% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. This quarter, we announced we'll increase our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.11 per share, which is about $600 million a quarter. I'm happy to say we expect to extend our status as a dividend aristocrat for another year. 
We repurchased about $250 million of our common shares this quarter. We have about $4.6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second half and intend to at least offset absolute dilution from shares issued during the year. 
As Jim mentioned, there's no change to our current practice relating to guidance. However, as we've been doing, we are providing color on the upcoming quarter to give you a sense of what we're expecting to happen. 
Moving to Slide 16. Again, we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins in 2021 despite reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program. That's now projected to be a headwind of $1.5 billion for the year or about 300 basis points of pressure on margins. We expect stronger sales than normal seasonality would imply. The growth rate in sales to users should continue to accelerate in the third quarter when compared to the prior year and should be significantly higher than the 15% rate we saw in the current quarter. 
In Construction Industries, we expect improvement in residential and nonresidential construction demand to continue. As we discussed last quarter, we see tougher comparisons in China. Resource Industries end user demand should see support from both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. We also expect Energy & Transportation sales to increase on stronger underlying demand. All of this is expected to lead to good volume growth in the third quarter, even while we manage supply chain challenges. As we told you last quarter, and as Jim mentioned today, whilst dealers are independent businesses and make their own decisions about their inventory, we don't expect a significant benefit from restocking in 2021. 
Third quarter margins are expected to be stronger than the prior year with leverage from strong volume more than offsetting the impact of green stating short-term incentive compensation. However, we anticipate third quarter margins to moderate versus the second quarter as we see some cost headwinds in the second half of the year. Within machines, we currently expect price to offset higher manufacturing costs in 2021. 
In the second quarter, price was strongly positive, reflecting strong geographic mix benefits and higher price realization. We did put through price increases from machines at the end of the second quarter, which will be positive, but geographic mix will be less of a benefit. Although we did take pricing actions, we do expect higher manufacturing costs, which means that our gross margin percentage will be moderately lower in the second half of the year versus the first half. 
We should also see accelerated spend in SG&A and R&D in the back half of the year as business gets back to normal. Specifically within Energy & Transportation, we expect some margin headwinds in the second half of the year. As E&T is a lumpy business with varying margin structures across these applications, we expect variability in both price and mix, particularly as larger deals were recognized into revenue. 
In addition, as many of the E&T applications are expecting -- experiencing different levels of demand, we did not put through additional price increases in the second half -- second quarter. So this means material and freight cost increases will be a headwind for that segment. 
In summary, on Slide 17. Demand continued to strengthen in the quarter, leading to strong volume growth. Adjusted operating profit margins improved by 480 basis points driven by higher volumes, which more than offset the nearly 300 basis headwind of short-term incentive compensation and the small headwinds of supply chain disruption and material cost inflation. 
Adjusted profit per share more than doubled in the quarter. We are confident in the outlook for our own markets and expect to achieve our Investor Day margin and free cash flow targets. And with that, we'll take your questions."

And first, we really appreciate the efforts of our employees to manage the challenges in the supply chain. And one of the things that we're seeing, of course, is improving end-user demand is adding pressure in the supply chain and on freight as well. And some of the supply chain challenges are more broad-based that occurs in a normal upturn. I mean you think about the last upturn, we had casting issues and some other individual component issues. This time, it's more broad-based than is typical. 
Having said that, again, as we said in the last call, our team is working very hard to avoid or minimize those supply chain challenges that would impact our ability to meet -- to fully meet improving customer demand. We think that the impact to the second quarter was modest. And again, we're working very hard to try to limit them. We haven't had some of the large factory shutdowns for weeks that you've read about with some other industrial companies. 
We've also taken some actions to do things like, with resins, we changed our material spec due to shortages that were out there, and that helped us keep production going. Again, the majority of our products for end users are delivered within the normal range of availability. Some of the bigger challenges have been on the smaller products, BCP. A lot of those products are used in residential in North America. So those are some of the bigger challenges we're having in terms of availability. But again, the majority of our products for our end users are within the normal ranges. And we're working very closely with our dealers to try to ensure that we meet actual customer demand."

And so again, we believe that will continue to grow at a rapid pace. We're also expanding our autonomous solutions to other support equipment like dozers, drills, underground equipment and water trucks as well. 
In terms of zero emissions products, we're very focused and working closely with our customers to meet their needs. We talked about the NMG announcement during the call here already this morning. That's a great example of one where a customer has a need. They have a date, they have to meet, and we're working very closely with them as their exclusive supplier with product and technologies to make it happen. So again, we're working very closely to develop products to meet customer demand. And as you can imagine, it's a big topic of discussion and focus by our leadership team and something we'll continue to do moving forward. 
And yet some of the goals we put out in our sustainability report, we talked about 100% of our new products through 2030 will be more sustainable than the previous generation in some manner, and we're very focused on doing that.

We don't give specific guidance on absolute revenue numbers, but obviously, we're giving you a little bit of color there. 
As far as the margin, yes, E&T will moderate. That's an impact, as we said, of not putting price through. Within CI and RI within the machines businesses, obviously, we've seen price benefit. Part of that price benefit is geo-mix. Geo mix will come off a little bit. So there will be an offset between geo mix and price, and that's really due to the mix of sales between the different geographies, which impacts geo-mix. So price won't improve, but obviously, you will start seeing some material cost increases and probably some increasing freight costs based on what we're seeing in the market today. That will be where the margin pressure is on the machine side, both CI and RI. 
Also, in addition, obviously, as I said, we do expect some increases in the underlying SG&A and R&D spend as the return to work normalizes and some of the things like travel start opening up and we start seeing some of those expenses come back."

The U.S., we saw inventory reductions and softer demand. So there was a negative drag on geo-mix. 
First quarter, obviously, China was very strong in CI. The U.S. is slightly weaker. Obviously, now in the second quarter, we've seen that turn around quite significantly, and that gave us a big benefit of geo-mix in Q2. That will moderate because the relative gap of North America versus the other geographies will actually diminish. So that's how it works, and that's why we think it will actually still be a benefit but will be less positive than it was in Q2. However, we do expect the price increases we put through to offset that. So we'll see other price realization mitigate that impact."

And also, we saw very minimal price. We saw stronger price in Q2, and the small increase in manufacturing costs.

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for another good quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth, while working to mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges as we serve our customers. 
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I'll briefly cover 3 topics this morning. I'll start with my perspective on the quarter's results, including an update on the supply chain. I'll then provide a few comments on market conditions. I'll finish with an update on recent developments concerning Caterpillar's sustainability journey. 
Sales and revenues were higher in all segments and in all regions during the quarter. Customer demand and order rates were strong. We experienced supply chain challenges, like many other industrial companies. We believe our sales in the third quarter would have been higher, if not for these issues. We are, however, pleased by our global team's ability to continue to execute in a challenging environment. 
Turning to Slide 4. The top line increased by 25%, primarily due to higher volumes, which was driven by strong end-user demand. Compared with the third quarter of 2020, sales to users rose about 14%. Sales to users rose in the 3 primary segments and in most regions. For machines, sales to users increased by 17%. For Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased 8%. 
Our assumption had been that third quarter growth in year-over-year sales to users would be significantly higher than the 15% growth reported in the second quarter. The growth rate in sales to users was less than we assumed at 14%, as construction industries grew a bit slower than the second quarter pace. This price, primarily due to constraints in the supply chain, which I'll cover in a moment. 
In Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation, the growth rate in sales to users accelerated on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, sales to users grew in all segments, in all regions, except Asia Pacific, driven by China, which was a bright spot in the third quarter of last year. We remain optimistic about demand in our 3 primary segments for the remainder of the year. 
Dealers, each of whom are independent businesses, decreased inventory by $300 million in the third quarter versus a decrease of $600 million in last year's third quarter. To put it in context, dealer inventory is about flat versus year-end 2020. Reported revenues for the quarter also benefited from growth in services, favorable price and currency. 
Turning to the supply chain. Our global team worked to mitigate the challenges we encountered in the third quarter, which were more significant than we expected. Our suppliers also experienced availability issues and freight delays, leading to pressure on production in our facilities. We put control towers in place to spotlight areas of concern across our operations and our value chain. We've proactively redirected components and altered our assembly processes as much as possible to keep output flowing. 
In addition, Caterpillar inventory grew by about $1 billion in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. Of the $1 billion increase, over half was an increase in production inventory. Our team continues to work closely with our suppliers to mitigate supply chain impacts on production. We experienced rising material and freight costs during the quarter. We continue to take appropriate price actions in response to rising costs and our monitoring situation. 
Operating profit for the third quarter increased by 69% to $1.7 billion. The increase in operating profit came from higher volume, favorable price and restructuring costs that were lower than last year. The adjusted operating profit margin improved to 13.7%, up 260 basis points, versus 11.1% in the third quarter of last year. That's despite the reinstatement of short-term incentive compensation this year. 
Margins were slightly stronger than we expected. Compared to the prior year, operating profit margins expanded in each of the 3 primary segments. Our profit per share was $2.60 versus $1.22 in the third quarter of 2020. The adjusted profit per share was $2.66 versus $1.52 in the third quarter of last year. 
Now on Slide 5. ME&T free cash flow for the quarter of around $800 million reflected higher volumes. Those benefits were partly offset by the increase in Caterpillar inventory. We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases this quarter. We also returned about $600 million in dividends to shareholders, reflecting the 8% dividend increase we announced in June. We paid a higher dividend annually for 27 consecutive years, and we remain proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let me share a few high-level assumptions about the full year. Looking at 2021 as a whole, we still expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins of 300 to 600 basis points of improvement versus our performance during the reference period of 2010 to 2016 at a similar level of sales. We also expect to achieve the free cash flow targets we set of an incremental $1 billion to $2 billion annually versus our cash flow performance during 2010 to 2016. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Overall, we remain optimistic about global demand, which has remained strong. However, supply chain challenges may impact our ability to fully meet customer demand. In Construction Industries, we remain positive as we've seen end-market demand increase in most regions. In North America, residential construction continues to be a strong driver of industry growth. Nonresidential is also improving, although activity remains below pre-pandemic levels. We are hopeful that Congress passes the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which could boost customer confidence and help support future demand. 
In China, we continue to expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to be about flat in 2021, with declines in the second half of the year offsetting growth in the first half. 
Outside of China, we expect the Asia Pacific region to remain strong in the fourth quarter, backed by strong housing activity, favorable commodity prices and the benefits of government stimulus. 
In EAME, fundamentals remain positive as stimulus actions continue and construction confidence improves. We expect the industry in Latin America to be supported by construction activity and continued -- and the continued mining recovery. 
Turning to Resource Industries. Elevated commodity prices and strong minor CapEx expectations support continued improvement in customer demand. The number of marked of parked trucks in the field remains low, and utilization has been improving. We also remain optimistic in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, where we continue to see improving demand. 
Finally, in Energy & Transportation, we expect demand to improve during the fourth quarter compared to last year. In oil and gas, we expect services growth and a focus on sustainability to drive demand for new equipment in the form of repowers. We expect that to be balanced, though, by continued capital discipline by our oil and gas customers. Recent power generation is expected to remain strong, with strength in data centers. Industrial is expected to see continued strength across all applications. A modest increase is anticipated in transportation with improvement in rail, primarily in services and international locomotives. 
Now on Slide 8. Sustainability remains an important element of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Recently, we took 3 actions that advance our sustainability efforts. We named Julie Legacy as our first Chief Sustainability and Strategy Officer. We committed to incorporate ESG performance into our 2022 incentive plan for executives. And we announced our plan to analyze the disclosure recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, and to utilize the TCFD framework to enhance our sustainability reporting starting in 2023. 
This past May, we disclosed our sustainability goals for 2030. Caterpillar is committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future. We demonstrate this in many ways, including through our significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and our continued investment in new products, technologies and services to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives as they build a better, more sustainable world. 
This quarter, our customers announced some exciting news in cooperation with Caterpillar. BHP and Caterpillar have agreed to test zero emissions, battery-powered large mining trucks at BHP sites to reduce their operational greenhouse gas emissions. We also signed an agreement with Rio Tinto for the world's first fleet of [ 793 zero ] emissions autonomous haul trucks to support its mining operations in Western Australia. This agreement helps support Rio Tinto's sustainability goals. This mine is also home to the world's first fully autonomous water truck, the CAT 789D. 
Enhancing grid stability is also critical for our customers. Our battery energy storage and bidirectional power inverters are built to provide continuous, reliable electric power and oil and gas sites. They can also be leveraged at remote mining sites, such as Barrick Gold Corporation's Kibali Gold mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo; collaborating with our customer and our local dealer, Tractor free. The battery energy storage capacity for the mines microgrid saves Barrick an estimated 3 million liters of diesel fuel annually. We displayed this solution in our MINExpo exhibit in Las Vegas in September, and it's a great example of how our technologies apply across our segments to provide customers with full site solutions. 
In summary, we continue executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while driving operational excellence. We continue to remain focused on sustainability. We're developing products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increase operational efficiency and reduce emissions to help our customers achieve their environmental and carbon-reduction goals. 
We had a strong third quarter overall with volume growth in all 3 primary segments and sales gains in every region. Operating profit margin expanded due largely to the volume gains. While material costs and freight have risen, so has price realization. With strong performance year-to-date, we remain on track to meet our Investor Day targets for ME&T margins and free cash flow for the year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Andrew."
259378,1682865708,2415530,"Caterpillar Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Caterpillar Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9 with my thoughts on Caterpillar's third quarter results, including the performance of each segment. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and conclude with a few assumptions about the fourth",1934,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9 with my thoughts on Caterpillar's third quarter results, including the performance of each segment. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and conclude with a few assumptions about the fourth quarter and full year. 
As Jim noted, our sales and revenues for the third quarter rose by 25% or $2.5 billion to $12.4 billion. This was primarily due to higher volumes. Operating profit increased by 69% to $1.7 billion. Third quarter profit per share was $2.60 compared to $1.22 in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share increased by 75% to $2.66 compared to $1.52 last year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Third quarter sales and revenues grew by double-digit percentage points for the 3 primary segments. Volume gains were the main growth driver with higher sales to users leading the way. In addition, dealer inventory provided a tailwind, declining by $300 million this quarter versus a $600 million decrease last year. Services revenues, favorable price and currency also contributed to the top line gain. Looking at it sequentially, sales in the third quarter were around 4% lower than in the second quarter, which is in line with normal seasonality. 
Third quarter sales and revenues increased in every region. In North America, our largest region, sales increased by 28%, with strong growth in all 3 primary segments. In EAME, sales rose by 23% as infrastructure spending supported higher demand. Latin America sales grew by 72% from a low base. Asia Pacific sales increased by 8%, with gains in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation more than offsetting lower revenues in Construction Industries. As Jim mentioned, China was a bright spot in the third quarter of 2020. So the decline in construction industry sales in China was in line with our expectations. 
As usual, we have separately reported our quarterly sales to users. Globally, sales to users increased by around 14% versus the year ago. As Jim previously commented, the 14% growth rate was below our expectations, primarily due to supply chain constraints. Sales for users and Construction Industries rose by 12%, with double-digit growth in North America, EAME and Latin America. Asia Pacific sales to users declined by 10%, reflecting the expected moderation in China, following the strong growth earlier this year. We still anticipate that the above 10-ton escalator industry will be about flat for the full year when compared to last year's very strong performance. 
Sales to users rose by 33% in Resource Industries. Growth was consistent across the segment as both mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates saw strong gains. 
In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 8%, reflecting gains in industrial and oil and gas applications, partially offset by reductions in both power generation and transportation. 
Now let's review the bottom line on Slide 11. Third quarter operating profit increased by $679 million or 69%. The higher volume was the principal driver of the increase in operating profit for the quarter. Volume gains and favorable price realization were partly offset by higher SG&A, R&D and manufacturing costs, which included both short-term incentive compensation expense as well as higher material and freight costs. 
Year-over-year, the adjusted operating profit margin rose by 260 basis points to 13.7%. Versus the second quarter, the adjusted operating profit margin declined by about 40 basis points, which was slightly better than we had anticipated. The main reason was a stronger gross margin due to better price and slightly lower material costs than we had expected. 
Our global effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25% versus the 26% we have assumed previously. Restructuring expenses of $35 million decreased by $77 million compared to last year. Adjusted profit per share of $2.66 was higher than we expected, reflecting the strong operational performance as well as the lower-than-expected global tax rate and discrete tax benefits. These accounted for about $0.14 per share in aggregate for the quarter. We also saw some currency benefits from hedging in the quarter, primarily related to the euro. 
Moving to Slide 12. Let's take a look at the segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 30% in the third quarter to $5.3 billion, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories. The increase in end-user demand was led by North America, where nonresidential construction demand continued to improve, and we also saw continued strength in residential construction. Overall, dealers reduced their construction equipment inventories less in the third quarter of 2021 than they did in the third quarter of 2020. 
The segment's third quarter profit went up by 47% to $859 million. The increase came from higher sales volume and federal price realization. This was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, which largely reflected higher freight and material costs. The segment's operating margin increased by 190 basis points versus last year to 16.3%. 
Turning to Slide 13. Resource Industries' sales increased by 32% in the third quarter to $2.4 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket products in both mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. This was partially offset by changes in dealer inventories. Third quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 78% to $297 million. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher freight and material costs. The segment's operating margin of 12.3% increased by 310 basis points when compared to 2020. 
Now on Slide 14. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 22% to approximately $5.1 billion. That included a 48% sales increase in oil and gas, which came off a low base and also included the addition of SPM Oil & Gas. Here, we saw higher sales in both reciprocating engines and turbines. Power generation sales declined slightly as turbines and related services were unfavorably impacted by the timing of customer projects. 
Industrial sales rose by 30%, with demand higher across all regions. Transportation rose by 12% or below base on higher rail services and marine sales. Profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 41% to $696 million. The improvement reflected higher sales volume. That was partially offset by a couple of factors: unfavorable manufacturing costs, including freight material; the impact of short-term incentive compensation; and acquisition-related expenses, primarily SPM Oil & Gas. Keep in mind that the third quarter of 2020 included an unfavorable impact from inventory write-downs and asset impairments. The segment's operating margin increased year-over-year by 190 basis points to 13.7%. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we do expect SPM Oil & Gas to modestly impact margins for Energy & Transportation this year, as it will take some time for the synergies to be realized. We remain very pleased with how the integration is going and expected to see the full benefits of the transaction as we move forward. 
On Slide 15, Financial Products revenue increased by 5% to $762 million. Segment profit increased by 22% year-over-year to $173 million. The year-over-year profit increase was partly due to favorability in returned or repossessed equipment, as the [ mean ] for used equipment remains very strong. We also benefited from a lower provision for credit losses, along with a higher net yield on average earning assets due to a favorable change in weighted average interest rates. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher short-term incentive compensation expense. 
Our credit portfolio remains in good shape as customer health indicators are positive. Past dues continue to improve across all portfolio segments to 2.41%. That's down 140 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points compared to the second quarter. This is below our 10-year average. 
New business volume also continued to improve. In fact, the third quarter of 2021 was the highest new business volume in the third quarter for 10 years. 
On Slide 16, ME&T free cash flow was $837 million in the quarter, slightly lower than we saw in the third quarter of last year. Higher profits were partly offset by a $1 billion increase in Caterpillar inventory in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. The growth in Caterpillar inventory reflected an increase in production inventory due to shortage of certain components and higher end-user demand. The company ended the quarter with $9.4 billion in enterprise cash. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position as we prioritize our strong mid-A credit ratings. 
ME&T has generated free cash flow of $4.2 billion year-to-date. We said at our 2019 Investor Day that we intended to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time, using a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We've repurchased about $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter, which brings the total to $1.6 billion year-to-date. We paid a dividend in the third quarter of $1.11 per share or about $600 million in aggregate, reflecting the 8% increase we announced in June. Through the end of the third quarter, we've returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now on Slide 17. In light of the highly fluid environment, we'll continue not providing guidance for our annual profit per share. To assist you with your modeling, though, we'll continue to share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter. 
We expect a stronger top line in the fourth quarter compared to the third, which would follow our normal seasonable pattern. As we said before, we do not expect a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2021. We expect our adjusted operating profit margin in the fourth quarter to generally follow the seasonal pattern of lower margins versus the third quarter. Sequentially, we see continued pressure from higher material and freight costs, which accelerated during the quarter and are likely to remain elevated in the fourth quarter. We anticipate this will be partly offset by price realization. We continue to expect price to offset higher manufacturing costs for machines in 2021, although further disruptions in the supply chain can make that more difficult. 
As we said previously, price realization will not offset manufacturing costs within Energy & Transportation. But as the fourth quarter is typically a stronger sales quarter in this segment, that will help its overall operating margin. 
As Jim mentioned, based on our results to date, we continue to anticipate meeting our Investor Day target for adjusted operating profit margins in 2021, despite the nearly 300 basis points of pressure from reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program. We currently anticipate 2021 restructuring expense of $150 million to $200 million compared with our previous estimate of $250 million. This compares to restructuring expenses of $354 million in 2020. We now expect the global effective tax rate for the year to be 25%, down from 26% earlier. We anticipate capital expenditures for the year of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion versus our previous estimate of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We also continue to anticipate reaching our target for ME&T free cash flow in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 18. In summary, demand remains strong, and we performed well in the quarter that presented additional complexity due to the challenges within the supply chain. Our operating performance was strong, with sales up 25% and adjusted profit per share up 75% versus the prior year. We remain on track to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margins and free cash flow for the year. 
With that, we'll now take your questions."

So within the quarter, as I mentioned, the gross margin did come in slightly better than we expected. Price was strong and a little bit better than we expected.

And obviously, we'll probably will see just as we talked about the fact that for the full year, we expect the machines price to offset manufacturing cost increases, including -- that's including short-term incentive compensation. We will expect to see a slight negative in Q4 as a result. 
Jim will -- with regard to future pricing, obviously, we continue to monitor the environment. We've taken appropriate price actions as we've gone through the year. And we will be taking -- obviously, looking at taking price actions as well within E&T, Energy and Transportation, as well as part of those actions. Those end markets are starting to recover as well.

The fundamentals are there. Commodity prices are generally supportive of reinvestment. Our mining customers are displaying capital discipline, as we've talked about before.

And one of the things to keep in mind is, if, in fact, the customer decides to keep a [ truck ] running longer than they normally would, that's not a bad thing for us either because we have the opportunity to repower and have services and parts, and that's good as well.

As we think about that maybe in the near term, my understanding is there was some additional price actions taken, at least in North America here in the last month or so. But obviously, just given these long lead times, that will take some time to come into effect. So how should we think about just maybe the near-term path of pricing again in your largest segment, not just in the fourth quarter, but how that maybe dovetails into next year as you start to ship some of these orders?"

Obviously, there will -- there's a lag, but it's not a huge drag that will come through. 
With regards to pricing as we move into 2022, I think we've indicated what we expect for the rest of the year. Obviously, we're in the middle of our planning process, that you should expect that we will continue to take the appropriate actions, both from a cost perspective to try and reduce costs, where possible, and some of those cost headwinds and also from a pricing perspective to make sure, at the same time, that we price competitively to make sure we continue to grow the business and meet customer demand. So it's a balancing act, but that will be something we'll continue to work on, as we say, as we go through 2022."

I'd like to start by thanking our global team for another good quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth, while working to mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges as we serve our customers.  
Before turning over the call to Andrew for a detailed review of our results, I'll briefly cover 3 topics this morning. I'll start with my perspective on the quarter's results, including an update on the supply chain. I'll then provide a few comments on market conditions. I'll finish with an update on recent developments concerning Caterpillar's sustainability journey.  
Sales and revenues were higher in all segments and in all regions during the quarter. Customer demand and order rates were strong. We experienced supply chain challenges, like many other industrial companies. We believe our sales in the third quarter would have been higher, if not for these issues. We are, however, pleased by our global team's ability to continue to execute in a challenging environment.  
Turning to Slide 4. The top line increased by 25%, primarily due to higher volumes, which was driven by strong end-user demand. Compared with the third quarter of 2020, sales to users rose about 14%. Sales to users rose in the 3 primary segments and in most regions. For machines, sales to users increased by 17%. For Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased 8%.  
Our assumption had been that third quarter growth in year-over-year sales to users would be significantly higher than the 15% growth reported in the second quarter. The growth rate in sales to users was less than we assumed at 14%, as construction industries grew a bit slower than the second quarter pace. This price primarily due to constraints in the supply chain, which I'll cover in a moment.  
In Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation, the growth rate in sales to users accelerated on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, sales to users grew in all segments, in all regions, except Asia Pacific, driven by China, which was a bright spot in the third quarter of last year. We remain optimistic about demand in our 3 primary segments for the remainder of the year.  
Dealers, each of whom are independent businesses, decreased inventory by $300 million in the third quarter versus a decrease of $600 million in last year's third quarter. To put it in context, dealer inventory is about flat versus year-end 2020.  Reported revenues for the quarter also benefited from growth in services, favorable price and currency.  
Turning to the supply chain. Our global team worked to mitigate the challenges we encountered in the third quarter, which were more significant than we expected. Our suppliers also experienced availability issues and freight delays, leading to pressure on production in our facilities. We put control towers in place to spotlight areas of concern across our operations and our value chain. We've proactively redirected components and altered our assembly processes as much as possible to keep output flowing.  
In addition, Caterpillar inventory grew by about $1 billion in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. Of the $1 billion increase, over half was an increase in production inventory. Our team continues to work closely with our suppliers to mitigate supply chain impacts on production. We experienced rising material and freight costs during the quarter. We continue to take appropriate price actions in response to rising costs and our monitoring situation.  
Operating profit for the third quarter increased by 69% to $1.7 billion. The increase in operating profit came from higher volume, favorable price and restructuring costs that were lower than last year. The adjusted operating profit margin improved to 13.7%, up 260 basis points, versus 11.1% in the third quarter of last year. That's despite the reinstatement of short-term incentive compensation this year.  
Margins were slightly stronger than we expected. Compared to the prior year, operating profit margins expanded in each of the 3 primary segments. Our profit per share was $2.60 versus $1.22 in the third quarter of 2020. The adjusted profit per share was $2.66 versus $1.52 in the third quarter of last year.  
Now on Slide 5. ME&T free cash flow for the quarter of around $800 million reflected higher volumes. Those benefits were partly offset by the increase in Caterpillar inventory. We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases this quarter. We also returned about $600 million in dividends to shareholders, reflecting the 8% dividend increase we announced in June. We paid a higher dividend annually for 27 consecutive years, and we remain proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.  
Turning to Slide 6. Let me share a few high-level assumptions about the full year. Looking at 2021 as a whole, we still expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins of 300 to 600 basis points of improvement versus our performance during the reference period of 2010 to 2016 at a similar level of sales. We also expect to achieve the free cash flow targets we set of an incremental $1 billion to $2 billion annually versus our cash flow performance during 2010 to 2016.  
Please turn to Slide 7. Overall, we remain optimistic about global demand, which has remained strong. However, supply chain challenges may impact our ability to fully meet customer demand. In Construction Industries, we remain positive as we've seen end-market demand increase in most regions. In North America, residential construction continues to be a strong driver of industry growth. Nonresidential is also improving, although activity remains below pre-pandemic levels. We are hopeful that Congress passes the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which could boost customer confidence and help support future demand.  
In China, we continue to expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to be about flat in 2021, with declines in the second half of the year offsetting growth in the first half.  
Outside of China, we expect the Asia Pacific region to remain strong in the fourth quarter, backed by strong housing activity, favorable commodity prices and the benefits of government stimulus.  
In EAME, fundamentals remain positive as stimulus actions continue and construction confidence improves. We expect the industry in Latin America to be supported by construction activity and continued -- and the continued mining recovery. 
Turning to Resource Industries. Elevated commodity prices and strong minor CapEx expectations support continued improvement in customer demand. The number of marked -- of parked trucks in the field remains low, and utilization has been improving. We also remain optimistic in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, where we continue to see improving demand. 
Finally, in Energy & Transportation, we expect demand to improve during the fourth quarter compared to last year. In oil and gas, we expect services growth and a focus on sustainability to drive demand for new equipment in the form of repowers. We expect that to be balanced, though, by continued capital discipline by our oil and gas customers. Recent power generation is expected to remain strong, with strength in data centers. Industrial is expected to see continued strength across all applications. A modest increase is anticipated in transportation with improvement in rail, primarily in services and international locomotives. 
Now on Slide 8. Sustainability remains an important element of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Recently, we took 3 actions that advance our sustainability efforts. We named Julie Lagacy as our first Chief Sustainability and Strategy Officer. We committed to incorporate ESG performance into our 2022 incentive plan for executives, and we announced our plan to analyze the disclosure recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, and to utilize the TCFD framework to enhance our sustainability reporting starting in 2023. 
This past May, we disclosed our sustainability goals for 2030. Caterpillar is committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future. We demonstrate this in many ways, including through our significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and our continued investment in new products, technologies and services to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives as they build a better, more sustainable world. 
This quarter, our customers announced some exciting news in cooperation with Caterpillar. BHP and Caterpillar have agreed to test zero emissions, battery-powered large mining trucks at BHP sites to reduce their operational greenhouse gas emissions. We also signed an agreement with Rio Tinto for the world's first fleet of 793 zero emissions autonomous haul trucks to support its mining operations in Western Australia. This agreement helps support Rio Tinto's sustainability goals. This mine is also home to the world's first fully autonomous water truck, the CAT 789D. 
Enhancing grid stability is also critical for our customers. Our betterish energy storage and bidirectional power inverters are built to provide continuous, reliable electric power at oil and gas sites. They can also be leveraged at remote mining sites, such as Barrick Gold Corporation's Kibali Gold mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo; collaborating with our customer and our local dealer, [ Tractor free ]. The battery energy storage capacity for the mines microgrid saves Barrick an estimated 3 million liters of diesel fuel annually. We displayed this solution in our MINExpo exhibit in Las Vegas in September, and it's a great example of how our technologies apply across our segments to provide customers with full site solutions. 
In summary, we continue executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth. We're investing in services and expanded offerings while driving operational excellence. We continue to remain focused on sustainability. We're developing products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increase operational efficiency and reduce emissions to help our customers achieve their environmental and carbon-reduction goals. 
We had a strong third quarter overall with volume growth in all 3 primary segments and sales gains in every region. Operating profit margin expanded due largely to the volume gains. While material costs and freight have risen, so has price realization. With strong performance year-to-date, we remain on track to meet our Investor Day targets for ME&T margins and free cash flow for the year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Andrew."
259378,1682865708,2415960,"Caterpillar Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Caterpillar Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9 with my thoughts on Caterpillar's third quarter results, including the performance of each segment. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and conclude with a few assumptions about the fourth",1937,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9 with my thoughts on Caterpillar's third quarter results, including the performance of each segment. Then I'll turn to the balance sheet and conclude with a few assumptions about the fourth quarter and full year. 
As Jim noted, our sales and revenues for the third quarter rose by 25% or $2.5 billion to $12.4 billion. This was primarily due to higher volumes. Operating profit increased by 69% to $1.7 billion. Third quarter profit per share was $2.60 compared to $1.22 in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share increased by 75% to $2.66 compared to $1.52 last year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Third quarter sales and revenues grew by double-digit percentage points for the 3 primary segments. Volume gains were the main growth driver with higher sales to users leading the way. In addition, dealer inventory provided a tailwind, declining by $300 million this quarter versus a $600 million decrease last year. Services revenues, favorable price and currency also contributed to the top line gain. Looking at it sequentially, sales in the third quarter were around 4% lower than in the second quarter, which is in line with normal seasonality. 
Third quarter sales and revenues increased in every region. In North America, our largest region, sales increased by 28%, with strong growth in all 3 primary segments. In EAME, sales rose by 23% as infrastructure spending supported higher demand. Latin America sales grew by 72% from a low base. Asia Pacific sales increased by 8%, with gains in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation more than offsetting lower revenues in Construction Industries. As Jim mentioned, China was a bright spot in the third quarter of 2020. So the decline in construction industry sales in China was in line with our expectations. 
As usual, we have separately reported our quarterly sales to users. Globally, sales to users increased by around 14% versus the year ago. As Jim previously commented, the 14% growth rate was below our expectations, primarily due to supply chain constraints. Sales for users and Construction Industries rose by 12%, with double-digit growth in North America, EAME and Latin America. Asia Pacific sales to users declined by 10%, reflecting the expected moderation in China, following the strong growth earlier this year. We still anticipate that the above 10-ton escalator industry will be about flat for the full year when compared to last year's very strong performance. 
Sales to users rose by 33% in Resource Industries. Growth was consistent across the segment as both mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates saw strong gains. 
In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 8%, reflecting gains in industrial and oil and gas applications, partially offset by reductions in both power generation and transportation. 
Now let's review the bottom line on Slide 11. Third quarter operating profit increased by $679 million or 69%. The higher volume was the principal driver of the increase in operating profit for the quarter. Volume gains and favorable price realization were partly offset by higher SG&A, R&D and manufacturing costs, which included both short-term incentive compensation expense as well as higher material and freight costs. 
Year-over-year, the adjusted operating profit margin rose by 260 basis points to 13.7%. Versus the second quarter, the adjusted operating profit margin declined by about 40 basis points, which was slightly better than we had anticipated. The main reason was a stronger gross margin due to better price and slightly lower material costs than we had expected. 
Our global effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25% versus the 26% we have assumed previously. Restructuring expenses of $35 million decreased by $77 million compared to last year. Adjusted profit per share of $2.66 was higher than we expected, reflecting the strong operational performance as well as the lower-than-expected global tax rate and discrete tax benefits. These accounted for about $0.14 per share in aggregate for the quarter. We also saw some currency benefits from hedging in the quarter, primarily related to the Euro. 
Moving to Slide 12. Let's take a look at the -- at segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 30% in the third quarter to $5.3 billion, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories. The increase in end-user demand was led by North America, where nonresidential construction demand continued to improve, and we also saw continued strength in residential construction. Overall, dealers reduced their construction equipment inventories less in the third quarter of 2021 than they did in the third quarter of 2020. 
The segment's third quarter profit went up by 47% to $859 million. The increase came from higher sales volume and federal price realization. This was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, which largely reflected higher freight and material costs. The segment's operating margin increased by 190 basis points versus last year to 16.3%. 
Turning to Slide 13. Resource Industries' sales increased by 32% in the third quarter to $2.4 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket products in both mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. This was partially offset by changes in dealer inventories. Third quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 78% to $297 million. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher freight and material costs. The segment's operating margin of 12.3% increased by 310 basis points when compared to 2020. 
Now on Slide 14. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 22% to approximately $5.1 billion. That included a 48% sales increase in oil and gas, which came off a low base and also included the addition of SPM Oil & Gas. Here, we saw higher sales in both reciprocating engines and turbines. Power generation sales declined slightly as turbines and related services were unfavorably impacted by the timing of customer projects. 
Industrial sales rose by 30%, with demand higher across all regions. Transportation rose by 12% or below base on higher rail services and marine sales. Profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 41% to $696 million. The improvement reflected higher sales volume. That was partially offset by a couple of factors: unfavorable manufacturing costs, including freight material; the impact of short-term incentive compensation; and acquisition-related expenses, primarily SPM Oil & Gas. Keep in mind that the third quarter of 2020 included an unfavorable impact from inventory write-downs and asset impairments. The segment's operating margin increased year-over-year by 190 basis points to 13.7%. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we do expect SPM Oil & Gas to modestly impact margins for Energy & Transportation this year, as it will take some time for the synergies to be realized. We remain very pleased with how the integration is going and expected to see the full benefits of the transaction as we move forward. 
On Slide 15, Financial Products' revenue increased by 5% to $762 million. Segment profit increased by 22% year-over-year to $173 million. The year-over-year profit increase was partly due to favorability in returned or repossessed equipment, as the [ miron ] for used equipment remains very strong. We also benefited from a lower provision for credit losses, along with a higher net yield on average earning assets due to a favorable change in weighted average interest rates. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher short-term incentive compensation expense. 
Our credit portfolio remains in good shape as customer health indicators are positive. Past dues continue to improve across all portfolio segments to 2.41%. That's down 140 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points compared to the second quarter. This is below our 10-year average. 
New business volume also continued to improve. In fact, the third quarter of 2021 was the highest new business volume in the third quarter for 10 years. 
On Slide 16, ME&T free cash flow was $837 million in the quarter, slightly lower than we saw in the third quarter of last year. Higher profits were partly offset by a $1 billion increase in Caterpillar inventory in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. The growth in Caterpillar inventory reflected an increase in production inventory due to shortage of certain components and higher end-user demand. The company ended the quarter with $9.4 billion in the enterprise cash. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position as we prioritize our strong mid-A credit ratings. 
ME&T has generated free cash flow of $4.2 billion year-to-date. We said at our 2019 Investor Day that we intended to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time, using a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We've repurchased about $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter, which brings the total to $1.6 billion year-to-date. We paid a dividend in the third quarter of $1.11 per share or about $600 million in aggregate, reflecting the 8% increase we announced in June. Through the end of the third quarter, we've returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now on Slide 17. In light of the highly fluid environment, we'll continue not providing guidance for our annual profit per share. To assist you with your modeling, though, we'll continue to share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter. 
We expect a stronger top line in the fourth quarter compared to the third, which would follow our normal seasonable pattern. As we said before, we do not expect a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2021. We expect our adjusted operating profit margin in the fourth quarter to generally follow the seasonable pattern of lower margins versus the third quarter. Sequentially, we see continued pressure from higher material and freight costs, which accelerated during the quarter and are likely to remain elevated in the fourth quarter. We anticipate this will be partly offset by price realization. We continue to expect price to offset higher manufacturing costs for machines in 2021, although further disruptions in the supply chain can make that more difficult. 
As we said previously, price realization will not offset manufacturing costs within Energy & Transportation. But as the fourth quarter is typically a stronger sales quarter in this segment, that will help its overall operating margin. 
As Jim mentioned, based on our results to date, we continue to anticipate meeting our Investor Day target for adjusted operating profit margins in 2021 despite the nearly 300 basis points of pressure from reinstating the short-term incentive compensation program. We currently anticipate 2021 restructuring expense of $150 million to $200 million compared with our previous estimate of $250 million. This compares to restructuring expenses of $354 million in 2020. We now expect the global effective tax rate for the year to be 25%, down from 26% earlier. We anticipate capital expenditures for the year of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion versus our previous estimate of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We also continue to anticipate reaching our target for ME&T free cash flow in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 18. In summary, demand remains strong, and we performed well in the quarter that presented additional complexity due to the challenges within the supply chain. Our operating performance was strong, with sales up 25% and adjusted profit per share up 75% versus the prior year. We remain on track to meet our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating margins and free cash flow for the year. 
With that, we'll now take your questions."

So within the quarter, as I mentioned, the gross margin did come in slightly better than we expected. Price was strong and a little bit better than we expected.

And obviously, we'll probably will see just as we talked about the fact that for the full year, we expect the machines' price to offset manufacturing cost increases, including -- that's including short-term incentive compensation. We will expect to see a slight negative in Q4 as a result. 
Jim will -- with regard to future pricing, obviously, we continue to monitor the environment. We've taken appropriate price actions as we've gone through the year.

So it's a combination of those 2 factors: very strong demand and supply chain challenges. Again, those independent dealers make their own decisions, but those 2 factors do have an impact on that low dealer inventory. And I'm going to ask you to clarify the question again."

And we have a lot of new solutions to help them do that, whether it's dynamic gas blending, where they can substitute upto 80%, 85% diesel fuel natural gas. We have a number of other solutions we had as well, which can help them reduce their carbon footprint. So we are seeing that happening. But again -- and again, I mentioned earlier that Solar tends to go into the trough a bit sooner than other companies and come out of it a bit later, but their services are strong as well.

We're seeing a situation where, let's say, there'll be a shortage in one component. We're very focused on that, that will ease.

So again, it's challenging, but we intend to work our way through it. 
And again, the one thing to keep in mind is, of course, demand. The good news is that what's driving a lot of this is customer demand is so strong. So that's the great news.
