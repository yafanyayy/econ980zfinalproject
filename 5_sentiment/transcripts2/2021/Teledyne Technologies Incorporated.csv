Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best ear",524,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%. Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%. 
For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly. Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of their efforts, I want to congratulate our employees as well as offer my most sincere thank you to them for transforming a difficult year into one of the most rewarding for our stockholders. 
We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses. In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14x sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. 
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021. Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat. 
Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition. We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the space -- space bay infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging. We believe then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary. For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business. Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018. 
While our respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of our end customers is an image or even better, information. This is true for extra imaging, infrared imaging, industrial machine vision and even our underwater marine sonar imaging and software businesses. In other words, there is similarity and synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning and other related technologies across each of our organizations. 
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different. Nevertheless, I have never been more excited about Teledyne's future than I am today with the pending acquisition of FLIR. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year. However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019. In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%. 
Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications. 
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record. 
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and full year 2021 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter, not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared to cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. 
Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly net discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

In Digital Imaging, the theme for Digital Imaging for us is recovery. And even though our revenue only went down 1% this year, we expect next year to recover and go up about 9% in Digital Imaging. Aerospace and Defense, we had a tough year, especially in Aerospace. And we expect some improvement, especially in our Defense businesses, I would say, about 4%. Engineered Systems had a great year, the best year among all of our businesses in terms of improving sales. So there, we expect their sales to improve very modestly less than 1%.

We think year-over-year, our free cash flow is going to be relatively flat, maybe a little down because, as you said, the conversion was phenomenal. There is, of course, we had the benefit of a payroll tax, about $24 million last year. Even though you put that in, it doesn't affect our already outstanding cash flow, so we've got to pay some of that back next year. But having said that, I think absent the onetime charges and expenses that come with the FLIR acquisition, our cash flow would be relatively flat, maybe a little down next year. But it will still be very close to the record that we accomplished this year.
Now with FLIR. What -- the way I can describe that is on an adjusted basis, if I may, because it is -- it's difficult for us to right now determine what that cash flow would be. But based on historical trends, we think, together, we would have an adjusted EBITDA after the acquisition of about $1.2 billion. Ours and theirs.

We have interacted with our banking institutions and we have secured financing for our term loans. First, we have $1.25 billion of term loans, which we have a commitment for. And the remainder of the $4 billion that we need will come in corporate bonds and that we will do after we have -- after we've obtained a rating for ourselves from the rating agencies, Moody's and S&P. And I think we will get an investment-grade rating, after which we will do that financing. 
The other thing that's important is that we have increased our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple to 4.8, and we think this would conveniently put us in a position where we'll have cash on hand after the acquisition. And our covenants are about 4.75% to 4-plus -- about 4.8% in net debt. And the last thing I would say is that we managed to also get a commitment to increase our line of credit from about what it is now $750 million to over $1.1 billion. So that's about the best I can do. 
In terms of rate -- average borrowing rate that you asked about, our best guess at this time, it's going to be  2.25%, maybe 2.3% of that order."

What we'll do, Joe, is we'll take the onetime cost and put it aside, as you know. But that's going to be significant. It's going to be -- I'm going to guess. My guess right now is about $175 million.

It's going to be -- I'm going to guess. My guess right now is about $175 million. It could be a little higher than that. So put that aside because there's nothing we can do about that. Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that two ways. You can look at it with as an adjusted basis. And when I talk adjust that I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year is going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, the cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive. 
So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at '21 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business. So we'll have a table of free cash flow to lay all of that out."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best ear",521,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%. Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%.
For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly. Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of their efforts, I want to congratulate our employees as well as offer my most sincere thank you to them for transforming a difficult year into one of the most rewarding for our stockholders. 
We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses. In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14x sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. 
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021. Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat. 
Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition. We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging. We believed then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary. For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business. Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018. 
While our respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of our end customers is an image or even better, information. This is true for extra imaging, infrared imaging, industrial machine vision and even our underwater marine sonar imaging and software businesses. In other words, there is similarity and synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning and other related technologies across each of our organizations. 
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different. Nevertheless, I have never been more excited about Teledyne's future than I am today with the pending acquisition of FLIR. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year. However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019. In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%.
Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications. 
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record. 
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter, not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared with cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. 
Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.

Engineered Systems had a great year, the best year among all of our businesses in terms of improving sales. So there, we expect their sales to improve very modestly less than 1%. And the way I've laid it out, Greg, so far, it adds up to something like 5.5% to 5.6%. I hope that's helpful."

But having said that, I think absent the onetime charges and expenses that come with the FLIR acquisition, our cash flow would be relatively flat, maybe a little down next year. But it will still be very close to the record that we accomplished this year.
Now with FLIR. What -- the way I can describe that is on an adjusted basis, if I may, because it's difficult for us to right now determine what that cash flow would be. But based on historical trends, we think, together, we would have an adjusted EBITDA after the acquisition of about $1.2 billion, ours and theirs.

And the remainder of the $4 billion that we need will come in corporate bonds and that we will do after we have a -- after we've obtained a rating for ourselves from the rating agencies, Moody's and S&P. And I think we will get an investment-grade rating, after which we will do that financing. 
The other thing that's important is that we have increased our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple to 4.8, and we think this would conveniently put us in a position where we'll have cash on hand after the acquisition. And our covenants are about 4.75% to 4-plus -- about 4.8% in net debt. And the last thing I would say is that we managed to also get a commitment to increase our line of credit from about what it is now $750 million to over $1.1 billion.

On the expansion side, which will keep us hopefully flat year-over-year since we have such a great year in 2020. On the expansion side, we won a number of contracts, multiyear contracts, some of which we put out news releases. And we think that we had about $0.5 billion in total of new contracts or renewal of contracts last year. For example, coming back to the [ Suez ], what we have is, we have our existing programs, which are about, rough numbers, let's say, they'll add up to about $350 million. Then we received a foreign military sales contract for new boats, which is about $35-or-so-million, and put the advance, $40 million. And that's a plus in that business.

Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that two ways. You can look at it with -- as an adjusted basis. And when I talk adjusted, I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year, it's going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive.
So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at 2021 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best ear",521,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%. Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%.
For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly. Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of their efforts, I want to congratulate our employees as well as offer my most sincere thank you to them for transforming a difficult year into one of the most rewarding for our stockholders. 
We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses. In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14x sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. 
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021. Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat. 
Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition. We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging. We believed then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary. For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business. Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018. 
While our respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of our end customers is an image or even better, information. This is true for extra imaging, infrared imaging, industrial machine vision and even our underwater marine sonar imaging and software businesses. In other words, there is similarity and synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning and other related technologies across each of our organizations. 
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different. Nevertheless, I have never been more excited about Teledyne's future than I am today with the pending acquisition of FLIR. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year. However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019. In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%.
Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications. 
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record. 
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and full year 2021 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter, not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared with cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. 
Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

In Digital Imaging, the theme for Digital Imaging for us is recovery. And even though our revenue only went down 1% this year, we expect next year to recover and go up about 9% in Digital Imaging. 
Aerospace and Defense, we had a tough year, especially in Aerospace. And we expect some improvement, especially in our Defense businesses, I would say, about 4%.
Engineered Systems had a great year, the best year among all of our businesses in terms of improving sales. So there, we expect their sales to improve very modestly less than 1%. And the way I've laid it out, Greg, so far, it adds up to something like 5.5% to 5.6%. I hope that's helpful."

But having said that, I think absent the onetime charges and expenses that come with the FLIR acquisition, our cash flow would be relatively flat, maybe a little down next year. But it will still be very close to the record that we accomplished this year.
Now with FLIR. What -- the way I can describe that is on an adjusted basis, if I may, because it's difficult for us to right now determine what that cash flow would be. But based on historical trends, we think, together, we would have an adjusted EBITDA after the acquisition of about $1.2 billion, ours and theirs.

We have interacted with our banking institutions and we have secured financing for our term loans. First, we have $1.25 billion of term loans, which we have a commitment for.

And I think we will get an investment-grade rating, after which we will do that financing. 
The other thing that's important is that we have increased our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple to 4.8, and we think this would conveniently put us in a position where we'll have cash on hand after the acquisition. And our covenants are about 4.75% to 4-plus -- about 4.8% in net debt. And the last thing I would say is that we managed to also get a commitment to increase our line of credit from about what it is now $750 million to over $1.1 billion. So that's about the best I can do. 
In terms of rate -- average borrowing rate that you asked about, our best guess at this time, it's going to be 2.25%, maybe 2.3% of that order."

On the expansion side, which will keep us hopefully flat year-over-year since we have such a great year in 2020. On the expansion side, we won a number of contracts, multiyear contracts, some of which we put out news releases.

For example, coming back to the [ Suez ], what we have is, we have our existing programs, which are about, rough numbers, let's say, they'll add up to about $350 million.

Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that 2 ways. You can look at it with -- as an adjusted basis. And when I talk adjusted, I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year, it's going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive.
So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at 2021 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best ear",521,"Thank you, Jason. Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'll begin by discussing our 2020 results, briefly comment on the outlook for 2021, and of course, comment on the pending acquisition of FLIR. We concluded 2020 with the best earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%. Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%.
For the full year 2020, GAAP operating margin increased slightly. Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million. It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of their efforts, I want to congratulate our employees as well as offer my most sincere thank you to them for transforming a difficult year into one of the most rewarding for our stockholders. 
We entered 2021 with a clear improvement in demand across the majority of our businesses. In fact, we received record orders in the fourth quarter and ended 2020 with record backlog. Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14x sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion. While it's still early in 2021, we're expecting continuing recovery in our commercial businesses as well as growth in our government businesses. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. 
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021. Of course, the largely pre-COVID comparison in the first quarter will be the most difficult with revenue relatively flat. 
Finally, I want to comment on the FLIR acquisition. We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging. We believed then and we believe now that our infrared imaging technologies and market segments are uniquely complementary. As both companies evolved, we've grown to be even more complementary. For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business. Perhaps more importantly, each company exited unattractive businesses, Teledyne in 2011 and FLIR in 2018. 
While our respective sensing technologies and market segments are different, the fundamental desire of our end customers is an image or even better, information. This is true for extra imaging, infrared imaging, industrial machine vision and even our underwater marine sonar imaging and software businesses. In other words, there is similarity and synergy in digitization, imaging algorithms, machine learning and other related technologies across each of our organizations. 
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different. Nevertheless, I have never been more excited about Teledyne's future than I am today with the pending acquisition of FLIR. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments."

Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year. However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter. Compared with last year, sales of certain products, such as wastewater samplers increased. However, this was more than offset by year-over-year declines and sales of selected industrial products, such as ambient air monitoring instrumentation. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million. Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019. In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%.
Now turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications. 
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record. 
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb. The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services. Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the first quarter and full year 2021 outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter, not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our first quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared with cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019. Record free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $144 million in 2019. 
Capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $23.9 million for the same period of 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.3 million for the same period of 2019. 
We ended the quarter with $105.4 million of net debt, that is $778.5 million of debt less cash of $673.1 million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 3.2%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2019. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $11.25 to $11.45. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.3%. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.

In Digital Imaging, the theme for Digital Imaging for us is recovery. And even though our revenue only went down 1% this year, we expect next year to recover and go up about 9% in Digital Imaging. 
Aerospace and Defense, we had a tough year, especially in Aerospace. And we expect some improvement, especially in our Defense businesses, I would say, about 4%.
Engineered Systems had a great year, the best year among all of our businesses in terms of improving sales. So there, we expect their sales to improve very modestly less than 1%. And the way I've laid it out, Greg, so far, it adds up to something like 5.5% to 5.6%. I hope that's helpful."

We think year-over-year, our free cash flow is going to be relatively flat, maybe a little down because, as you said, the conversion was phenomenal. There is, of course, we had the benefit of a payroll tax, about $24 million last year. Even though you put that in, it doesn't affect our, really outstanding cash flow, so we've got to pay some of that back next year.
But having said that, I think absent the onetime charges and expenses that come with the FLIR acquisition, our cash flow would be relatively flat, maybe a little down next year. But it will still be very close to the record that we accomplished this year.
Now with FLIR. What -- the way I can describe that is on an adjusted basis, if I may, because it's difficult for us to right now determine what that cash flow would be. But based on historical trends, we think, together, we would have an adjusted EBITDA after the acquisition of about $1.2 billion, ours and theirs.

We have interacted with our banking institutions and we have secured financing for our term loans. First, we have $1.25 billion of term loans, which we have a commitment for. And the remainder of the $4 billion that we need will come in corporate bonds and that we will do after we have a -- after we've obtained a rating for ourselves from the rating agencies, Moody's and S&P. And I think we will get an investment-grade rating, after which we will do that financing. 
The other thing that's important is that we have increased our net debt-to-EBITDA multiple to 4.8, and we think this would conveniently put us in a position where we'll have cash on hand after the acquisition. And our covenants are about 4.75% to 4-plus -- about 4.8% in net debt. And the last thing I would say is that we managed to also get a commitment to increase our line of credit from about what it is now $750 million to over $1.1 billion. So that's about the best I can do. 
In terms of rate -- average borrowing rate that you asked about, our best guess at this time, it's going to be 2.25%, maybe 2.3% of that order."

So that's on the contraction side.
On the expansion side, which will keep us hopefully flat year-over-year since we have such a great year in 2020. On the expansion side, we won a number of contracts, multiyear contracts, some of which we put out news releases. And we think that we had about $0.5 billion in total of new contracts or renewal of contracts last year. For example, coming back to the [ Suez ], what we have is, we have our existing programs, which are about, rough numbers, let's say, they'll add up to about $350 million. Then we received a foreign military sales contract for new boats, which is about $35-or-so-million, and put the advance, $40 million. And that's a plus in that business.

Then you go to, let's assume, the merger happens, the acquisition happens on July 1. Then what we're looking at is -- you can look at that 2 ways. You can look at it with -- as an adjusted basis. And when I talk adjusted, I'm only speaking about adjustment for intangible amortization, nothing else. If you look at it that way, then the acquisition is going to be accretive almost immediately. And the first full year, it's going to be accretive significantly. It could be as accretive as $2.50. With the $40 million, the tax takeout, cost takeout that we're estimating for the first full year, we think on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive after the first full year, marginally accretive.
So the way we presented is what is the combined revenue going to be? At this point, I would say of the -- if you look at the 2020 pro forma, you're looking at $5 billion. If you look at 2021 plus FLIR for the first full year, you're looking at $5.2 billion in revenue. And then we will work on the free cash flow same as we do now. We'll probably present it on a non-GAAP basis. Only I say that because in our agreement with our lenders, in terms of what they have agreed to in terms of our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA, they're excluding the onetime costs that we're going to incur in that business. So we'll have a table of free cash flow to lay all of that out."

We began 2021 with the best first quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR. Excluding these nonrecurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year.
Operating margin increased 426 basis points and free cash flow nearly doubled. In addition, I'm very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne. Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales. The recovery in our short-cycle commercial business is encoding nicely, and our government businesses are also growing and performing well. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment.
Also in the first quarter, we received all-time record orders with a book-to-bill of 1.15x, resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6%, led by forecasted growth of about 10% in Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR.
And now with respect to the FLIR acquisition. Over the last few months, while transaction certainty progressively increased Teledyne performed in-person visits, covering 90% of all FLIR-owned sites, several on multiple occasions. Most importantly, we were also granted access to the operating management in all key functional areas.
To summarize, FLIR's people, products, technology and manufacturing are outstanding. I am now even more excited about the prospect for FLIR as part of the Teledyne family.
Regarding timing, our respective stockholder votes are scheduled for Thursday, May 13. And pending approval, we expect to close early the following morning. Assuming closing occurs as planned, we expect to update our outlook in the July earnings release and include FLIR. We remain confident of immediate pretax annual synergies greater than $40 million, and we continue to expect EPS accretion, even on a GAAP basis in 2022 with EPS accretion, excluding amortization being substantially greater.

Sales of our electronic test and measurement systems increased 4.8% year-over-year.
Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 6.7% in the quarter. However, Operating profit increased due to aggressive cost management and business simplification and standardization initiatives. Overall, Instruments segment operating margin increased 291 basis points to 20.7%.
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.7%. GAAP segment operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year.
Now turning to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. First quarter sales declined 3.3%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin increased over 1,000 basis points to 18.7% versus 8.6% in 2020.
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 8.5%, primarily due to greater sales from defense and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services products. Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $124.9 million compared with cash flow of $76.4 million for the same period of 2020.
Record first quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $107.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $56.2 million in 2020. Excluding after-tax cash payments related to the FLIR transaction, first quarter free cash flow was $110.1 million.
Capital expenditures were $17.6 million in the first quarter compared to $20.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million for both the first quarters of 2021 and 2020.
We ended the quarter with $9.1 million of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of approximately $3.23 million. With higher cash and debt balances at April 4, 2021, including the proceeds of debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the FLIR Test acquisition. Stock option compensation expense was $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $7.4 million for the same period of 2020.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $12 to $12.20. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.6%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.

So we projected margin improvement of about 10 basis points. We think the margins are now going to be closer to 140 basis points for the year, which is an increase of about 130 basis points.
Moving to the second one, which is Engineered Systems that you mentioned. We had a very strong first quarter, primarily because we shipped all of our turbine engines that were due to finish that production cycle in the first quarter. So our margins were a healthy over 14.2%.
We were initially projecting margins for the year of about 15 basis point improvement. Currently, because primarily of the first quarter, we think overall margins for this segment would increase to about 180 basis points, with the rest of the year moderating closer to the 12% to 12.2% that this business has normally experienced. I think those were the 2 areas that you asked about."

So those would be the synergies that at this time.
In terms of revenue synergies, we haven't really looked at that very closely. And frankly, we operate in different markets, the things that we can obviously look at very quickly would be how do we jointly go to market in areas where we have complementary products."

The reason for that is twofold. One is the savings what I mentioned. The other is, even in last year's revenue and earnings that they had in 2020, their margins -- operating margins after all of those onetime costs on a GAAP basis, were 16.5%, which to us is a very healthy margin. As you know, we -- this quarter, we've been up to 17.5%, but 16.5% is very good. And if we can improve that, then obviously, we'll get substantial accretion. ex-intangibles."

Having said that, in inventory buildup at FLIR, from what we saw in '19 and '20 was substantial and partially because of the elevated scheme temperatures programs that they enjoyed. So they have a significant inventory buildup in that and some other areas that we have to look at very carefully. And we may have to write those up. We may have to write those down, but we see as we get to it. But overall, our projections are that we, ourselves, should have free cash flow that surpasses, slightly surpasses last year.

The recovery is a little slower than we anticipated, but it is there. We're getting some really good orders in that domain, more in the flat panel display with the X-ray sources kind of lagging a little bit, but still coming up.
Going back to the question vis-a-vis regular, the commercial systems, commercial error in Digital Imaging. First, it's small. Second, it's not that dependent on airline traffic is different than anything else. It's primarily in space domain. And we have not seen any deterioration there.

We continue to put new products out. Like last week alone, we announced 3 products in oscilloscope and protocol. But more importantly, what our guys have been able to do is marry those 2 businesses, those 2 products together. So now people can do protocol development and analysis using the oscilloscopes as real-time observation of the signals. And that's going to be a very good for that area.
You also asked me about semi. In Digital Imaging is primarily where we focus on the semi market. And there is mask and wafer inspection. That's been a really good market for us. If you -- if I look at our growth in vision systems, which includes flat panel displays as well as semi inspection, we anticipate that year-over-year to be about 12% to 13% revenue growth. So that kind of speaks for that.
And then lastly, I would point out 1 example of why digital imaging and relevant semiconductor markets are doing so well for us. We do have a product that comes off our MEMS foundry in Canada. These are telecoms, which are very thin, 1/10 of a human hair thickness, but 6 to 8 inches in diameter consumable products that are used in extreme UV lithography for verifying semiconductors. They essentially are screens that protect the wafers below them. And in that area, we've really done well and have not captured that market and we have a wonderful customer there.

So you have to look at it at this time, you have to look at that, excluding interest expenses, related to the FLIR acquisition as well as some of the legal expenses that come above the mine. Now once we acquire FLIR, assuming the shareholders approve the transaction, then what we will do is we'll have to put the interest in the -- for the total company as part of our moving forward normal cost in GAAP. But there are going to be some other costs associated with the transaction that we are going to be substantial. Those would be onetime charges. And as we talked earlier, we call those intangibles. Later on, also would be some inventory write-ups and other things.
Having said all of that, the $12 to $12.20 excludes these FLIR transaction costs, which in the first quarter, were about $39 million, $5.9 million of it was above the line, which was legal fees and also fees for bankers. And the rest of it or about $33 million was interest in getting the bonds and getting the -- redeeming some of the bonds that we already had outstanding. So I hope that answers your question.
Come July, we'll kind of clean this up and do it. What did we say in April as Teledyne stand-alone, how are we looking at flare what we expect to happen there? We learn a lot more about them as they do their own earnings. I think it's May 6. And then we'll project what the combined company would be like with and without the onetime costs. And as I mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be accretive even on a GAAP basis in 2022."

We're a little bit concerned that maybe the projections for them were a little aggressive in the S4. Having said that, we have now looked at their businesses a little differently than the way they reported in the segments, which is the industrial segment and the defense segment, we've gone back, Andrew, I looked at the businesses from a divisional perspective, the way they were in 2014, which were 6 divisions.
So we've gone back and fortunately, they were kindly not and good enough to provide us with the financial data in those divisions. And then they have added 2 new things to it, and I'm going to come to the first question that you asked. One of them is a small vision product that they bought in Canada, Point Grey, which they report as part of their components business. And that business is fairly stable. It's a small business of the order of $80 million.
Now coming to the next area, which is new. So now they have kind of -- if you look at it the way I just mentioned, they have 8 divisions, the way we look at it. The way we look at the Defense segment, it really has 1 part of it that is really new, and that's their unmanned systems, both UAV and ground-based and band systems. And that has enjoyed really good growth primarily because they've made some good acquisitions, And they've also starting with an acquisition they made in 2016 product dynamics, which makes the very small UAVs, and they enjoyed about $260 million in revenue in 2020 in that unmanned segment, which is both ground-based and UAVs. That business, I think, will grow. And I think that business will grow significantly from our perspective. And I'm hoping that we'll grow enough to make up for some of the detriment decrement that we see from the business that they provided elevated skin temperature products that are going to were down maybe last year when over $100 million, go down to less than $20 million or whatever. Having said that, so we're hoping that, as you mentioned, the Defense businesses, because of the acquisition now kicking in 4 years, that those would make up the decrement in the EST business.
I don't know if I've answered your question, but I think that's the best I can do at this time."

We began 2021 with the best first quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the company's history. Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR. Excluding these nonrecurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year. 
Operating margin increased 426 basis points and free cash flow nearly doubled. In addition, I'm very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne. Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category, except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales. The recovery in our short-cycle commercial business is unfolding nicely, and our government businesses are also growing and performing well. In both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. 
Also in the first quarter, we received all-time record orders with a book-to-bill of 1.15x, resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6%, led by forecasted growth of about 10% in Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR. 
And now with respect to the FLIR acquisition. Over the last few months, while transaction certainty progressively increased, Teledyne performed in-person visits, covering 90% of all FLIR-owned sites, several on multiple occasions. Most importantly, we were also granted access to the operating management in all key functional areas. To summarize, FLIR's people, products, technology and manufacturing are outstanding. I am now even more excited about the prospect for FLIR as part of the Teledyne family. 
Regarding timing, our respective stockholder votes are scheduled for Thursday, May 13. And pending approval, we expect to close early the following morning. Assuming closing occurs as planned, we expect to update our outlook in the July earnings release and include FLIR. We remain confident of immediate pretax annual synergies greater than $40 million, and we continue to expect EPS accretion, even on a GAAP basis in 2022 with EPS accretion, excluding amortization being substantially greater. 
Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments. Al?"

Sales of our electronic test and measurement systems increased 4.8% year-over-year. 
Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 6.7% in the quarter. However, operating profit increased due to aggressive cost management and business simplification and standardization initiatives. Overall, instrument's segment operating margin increased 291 basis points to 20.7%. 
Turning to Digital Imaging segment. First quarter sales increased 6.7%. GAAP segment operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. 
Now turning to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. First quarter sales declined 3.3%, as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating margin increased over 1,000 basis points to 18.7% versus 8.6% in 2020. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 8.5%, primarily due to greater sales from defense and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services products. Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year.

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $124.9 million compared with cash flow of $76.4 million for the same period of 2020. Record first quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $107.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $56.2 million in 2020. Excluding after-tax cash payments related to the FLIR transaction, first quarter free cash flow was $110.1 million. 
Capital expenditures were $17.6 million in the first quarter compared to $20.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million for both the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. 
We ended the quarter with $9.1 million of net debt. That is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of approximately $3.23 million. With higher cash and debt balances at April 4, 2021, including the proceeds of debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the FLIR acquisition. 
Stock option compensation expense was $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $7.4 million for the same period of 2020. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95 per share. And for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $12 to $12.20. In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 22.6%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.

So our margins were a healthy over 14.2%. We were initially projecting margins for the year of about 15 basis point improvement.

Of course, again, excluding the intangibles, which is substantial. 
The reason for that is twofold. One is the savings what I mentioned. The other is, even in last year's revenue and earnings that they had in 2020, their margins -- operating margins after all of those onetime costs on a GAAP basis, were 16.5%, which to us is a very healthy margin.

The one area, I think the conversion overall, was it's going to be better than 100%. Having said that, in inventory buildup at FLIR, from what we saw in '19 and '20 was substantial and partially because of the elevated skin temperatures programs that they enjoyed. So they have a significant inventory buildup in that and some other areas that we have to look at very carefully. And we may have to write those up. We may have to write those down, but we see as we get to it. 
But overall, our projections are that we, ourselves, should have free cash flow that surpasses, slightly surpasses last year. And last year was a record year for us at $547 million, $445 million. So if we can exceed that ourselves and do well with the FLIR cash flow, that's very important, Blake, because we intend to pay down our debt as fast as we possibly can over the next 2 years."

The recovery is a little slower than we anticipated, but it is there. We're getting some really good orders in that domain, more in the flat panel display with the X-ray sources kind of lagging a little bit, but still coming up. 
Going back to the question vis-a-vis regular, the commercial systems, commercial aero in Digital Imaging. First, it's small. Second, it's not that dependent on airline traffic. It's different than anything else. It's primarily in space domain. And we have not seen any deterioration there. And actually, we think that on our aerospace and defense in the Digital Imaging domain, we think we'll see about a 7% improvement in revenue this year from $270 million last year to maybe $290 million in this year. So the only area of aerospace that we've taken some punishment is in the aerospace businesses in Teledyne's normal defense and aerospace domain."

If you go to Instrumentation, we did have some significant improvements in margin and environmental and test and measurement in the first quarter, and we expect those to continue for the rest of the year. We also had some improvement in margin in the marine businesses, even though revenue, as Al mentioned, was down somewhat. We think the revenue will catch up the rest of the year. And as that, as the margins there will improve also. So we think overall Instrumentation, we have the best margins in the environmental area by 23%. Second best margins in our test and measurement over 21%. And marine is approaching 19 -- over 19%. 
So when you roll it all up, we're going to get close to 20.9% in Instrumentation. I think that's going to be healthy for us, especially if marine, as we expect because of the oil prices going up to about 65% currently. If that improves, then I think that segment is going to do really well. That's why I said our outlook for the margins has improved 130 basis points since January of this year."

Having said all of that, we're managing it, but we also are getting products from foundries, for example, that come to our wafers that we get. In that case, we're fortunate because the guys who supply us wafers are also our customers. So in some areas, we think we're going to be okay. In other areas, I'm very cautious, be optimistic. But this thing can really spin out of control, and then we'll have to deal with it again."

I think we'll end the year with the book-to-bill in Digital Imaging of 1.08, maybe 1.10. So that's our first area. 
I think in the Instrumentation area, we're right now just over 1, but a lot about this short-cycle business is marine comes back as we expect and the other areas come back as we expect. We think, especially in test and measurement, we could have as much as 8% growth in environment of 6%, 6.5%. And if marine comes back, that would be another 2%. So overall, I think Instrumentation should give us about 5.3%, 5.2% for the year. For us, that's again, very good because those are the highest margin businesses. 
Engineered Systems, I think, would be fairly flat year-over-year. We don't expect aerospace to really come back that much this year. It's probably a 2-year cycle, but our defense businesses are doing okay. So I anticipate in aerospace and defense combined to enjoy a 4% margin -- 4% revenue improvement this year. Roll all of that together, and you're going to end up with about 6% for the company, which would be one of our healthier organic growth rates in revenue in the recent past."

We have 2 -- as you know, we have 2 areas that we focus on there. One of them is oscilloscopes and the other is protocols, which are the rules that chips communicate with one another.
We continue to put new products out. Like last week alone, we announced 3 products in oscilloscope and protocol. But more importantly, what our guys have been able to do is marry those 2 businesses, those 2 products together. So now people can do protocol development and analysis using the oscilloscopes as real-time observation of the signals. And that's going to be a very good for that area.
You also asked me about semi. In Digital Imaging is primarily where we focus on the semi market. And there is mask and wafer inspection. That's been a really good market for us. If you -- if I look at our growth in vision systems, which includes flat panel displays as well as semi inspection, we anticipate that year-over-year to be about 12% to 13% revenue growth. So that kind of speaks for that.
And then lastly, I would point out one example of why Digital Imaging and relevant semiconductor markets are doing so well for us. We do have a product that comes off our MEMS foundry in Canada. These are telecoms, which are very thin, 1/10 of a human hair thickness, but 6 to 8 inches in diameter consumable products that are used in extreme UV lithography for verifying semiconductors. They essentially are screens that protect the wafers below them. And in that area, we've really done well and have not captured that market and we have a wonderful customer there.
So overall, to answer your question, test and measurement, I talked about. And in the semi, the products that we supply to them are doing pretty well."

On the other hand, FLIR also gets wafers and they also make a lot of their own sensors, both on the cooled and the uncooled side.

Now once we acquire FLIR, assuming the shareholders approve the transaction, then what we will do is we'll have to put the interest in the -- for the total company as part of our moving forward normal cost in GAAP. But there are going to be some other costs associated with the transaction that we -- they're going to be substantial. Those would be onetime charges. And as we talked earlier, we call those intangibles. Later on, also would be some inventory write-ups and other things.
Having said all of that, the $12 to $12.20 excludes these FLIR transaction costs, which in the first quarter, were about $39 million, $5.9 million of it was above the line, which was legal fees and also fees for bankers. And the rest of it or about $33 million was interest in getting the bonds and getting the -- redeeming some of the bonds that we already had outstanding. So I hope that answers your question.
Come July, we'll kind of clean this up and do it. What did we say in April as Teledyne stand-alone, how are we looking at FLIR, what we expect to happen there? We learn a lot more about them as they do their own earnings. I think it's May 6. And then we'll project what the combined company would be like with and without the onetime costs.

We're a little bit concerned that maybe the projections for them were a little aggressive in the S-4. Having said that, we have now looked at their businesses a little differently than the way they reported in the 2 segments, which is the industrial segment and the defense segment. We've gone back, Andrew, I looked at the businesses from a divisional perspective, the way they were in 2014, which were 6 divisions.
So we've gone back and, fortunately, they were kind enough and good enough to provide us with the financial data in those divisions. And then they have added 2 new things to it, and I'm going to come to the first question that you asked. One of them is a small vision product that they bought in Canada, Point Grey, which they report as part of their components business. And that business is fairly stable. It's a small business of the order of $80 million.
Now coming to the next area, which is new. So now they have kind of -- if you look at it the way I just mentioned, they have 8 divisions, the way we look at it. The way we look at the defense segment, it really has one part of it that is really new, and that's their unmanned systems, both UAV and ground-based and manned systems. And that has enjoyed really good growth primarily because they've made some good acquisitions, and they've also starting with an acquisition they made in 2016, Prox Dynamics, which makes the very small UAVs, and they enjoyed about $260 million in revenue in 2020 in that unmanned segment, which is both ground-based and UAVs. 
That business, I think, will grow. And I think that business will grow significantly from our perspective. And I'm hoping that we'll grow enough to make up for some of the decrement that we see from the business that they provided, elevated skin temperature products that are going to go down maybe last year where over $100 million, go down to less than $20 million or whatever. Having said that, so we're hoping that, as you mentioned, the defense businesses, because of the acquisition now kicking in 4 years, that those would make up the decrement in the EST business.
I don't know if I've answered your question, but I think that's the best I can do at this time."

For over 2 decades now, we've continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded e",696,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. 
For over 2 decades now, we've continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns. It is worth noting that just over 10 years ago, a major milestone occurred when we divested our aviation piston engine business and all of its associated liabilities. 
While initiated earlier, immediately following that gives picture, we accelerated our pace of change by making increasingly significant and successful acquisitions within our Digital Imaging and Instrumentation businesses. Our recent acquisition of FLIR accelerates Teledyne's evolution into a more attractive, higher-margin industrial technology company, while at the same time, maintaining our balanced portfolio, primarily focused on commercial markets, but with a resilient and predictable backbone of government businesses. 
For example, in the second quarter of 2021, 75% of total company sales were derived from U.S. commercial and international customers and 25% of sales from the U.S. government. 
In the past several weeks, we've made rapid progress integrating FLIR by implementing Teledyne processes such as acceleration of financial forecasting and reporting, increasing visibility of sales and costs across the organization while continuing to enhance players' compliance standards. Furthermore, we've eliminated significant corporate overhead, consultants and other third-party service providers. And as a result, we now expect to achieve our annualized cost savings target of $80 million before the end of 2022, as opposed to 2024, as described in our final merger proxy. 
Turning to the second quarter results. The second quarter was truly a record for Teledyne with sales, operating margin and earnings, that's excluding acquisition-related costs, all of this increased significantly from prior period. We achieved double-digit organic growth for the total company, with sales from Digital Imaging, Environmental and Electronic Test and Measurement, Instrumentation increasing from 17% to nearly 25% year-over-year. 
The operating margin of our legacy businesses collectively was an all-time record. And with FLIR, our non-GAAP operating margin of 22.8% was an all-time record in the second quarter. I should note that very strong non-GAAP margin and earnings performance in Q2 resulted partially from a disproportionate amount of sales from FLIR relative to costs, that is, given FLIR's current lack of linearity shipments, we essentially benefited from 8.5 weeks equivalent of sales volume and contribution margin relative to only 6 weeks of fixed cost. 
In the second half, FLIR's quarterly sales relative to costs were normalized, resulting in somewhat lower margins in all cases, excluding transaction-related expenses. In addition, the average share count in the second quarter only partially reflected the stock issued in connection with the FLIR transaction which will impact EPS in the second half. 
On a full year basis, and after a strong first half, we now think it's reasonable outlook for legacy Teledyne businesses' organic growth in 2021 to be approximately 6.5%, led by forecasted growth of nearly 12% in Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR. With normalized sales for Q3 and Q4, we expect FLIR to contribute sales of just under $1.3 billion in 2021. Collectively, therefore, we now expect reported sales for the year of approximately $4.580 billion. 
Our new outlook, which excludes acquisition-related transactions, transaction and purchase accounting expenses can be summarized as follows. In April, we provided a GAAP earnings outlook for legacy Teledyne businesses of about $12.10. On a comparable basis, our current outlook is approximately $12.40, which is $0.30 above the earlier outlook. Given the 50 basis points increase in organic growth from 6% to 6.5% today versus April and 40 basis points additional margin improvement, that's resulted in the overall $0.30 increase in our guidance. 
Intangible asset amortization from prior to FLIR transactions, divided by the pre-FLIR share count would add around $0.80 to our earnings, resulting in a pre-FLIR outlook of $13.20. 
Now incorporating FLIR, including its unusually strong period -- partial period performance in Q2 and excluding transaction costs, results in full year 2021, accretion of over $2 per share and thus, our current non-GAAP outlook is $15.25 to $15.50. 
I will now just turn the call over to Al who will comment on the performance of our business segments."

In our Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales increased 143.9%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth was 17%. Segment operating margin was 14.6% and 27.5% when adjusting for transaction costs and purchase accounting, although this was unusually high, as Robert mentioned earlier. 
In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 10.6% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 19.6% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased and total quarterly sales were just slightly lower than the peak level before the COVID pandemic. 
Sales of Electronic Test and Measurement Systems were exceptionally strong and increased 24.6% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of our marine instrumentation decreased 4.5% in the quarter. However, orders were the strongest in the last 5 quarters with the second quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 33.2%, with segment operating margin increasing over 360 basis points with or without intangible asset amortization. 
Moving to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. Second quarter sales increased 6.5%, driven by an 8.1% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with flat year-over-year sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 62.3% with margins 640 basis points greater than last year. 
In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue decreased 1.5%, primarily due to greater sales from missile defense and marine manufacturing programs more than offset by lower sales of electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines as we exited the cruise missile engine business at the end of the first quarter. Despite slightly lower sales, segment operating profit and margin increased slightly when compared with last year. 
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our full year 2021 earnings outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $211.3 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax, cash from operations was $278.0 million compared with cash flow of $155.8 million for the same period of 2020. 
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $257.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $139.2 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million in the second quarter compared to $16.6 million for the same period of 2020. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $59.7 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared with $29 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $23.4 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $4.05 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.74 billion of debt less cash of $695.1 million. The higher debt balance at July 4, 2021 included the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the FLIR acquisition. 
Stock option compensation expense was $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $8.05 to $8.45. And on a non-GAAP basis, $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items, is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I will now pass the call back to Robert."

As I mentioned before, we think that on a non-GAAP basis, we'll have an upside of about -- with $2 to $2.20 in terms of earnings. If we can maintain that momentum for next year, where we would enjoy probably the full year benefit of the cost reduction, I would say we may be able to increase that to as high as $2.50 from this year's $2 and $2.20. The only reason I say that is the full year dilution we will experience from share count. Our share count in Q3, Q2 was 43.7%, 44 million shares. Next year, full year, we'll have a a 48 million share count plus as we will have in Q3, Q4 of this year. So there's going to be some of that. 
And frankly, the other side of it to is that we haven't really had an opportunity to put all of our internal cost reduction inside FLIR for next year yet. These cost reductions we spoke about were generally related to corporate expenses, employee expenses, costs and third-party expenses and consultants. The -- I hope that there'll be other opportunities that we can enjoy over the '22, but it's only 8 weeks in. It's a little hard to predict right now."

Specifically, for example, FLIR has, as you know, a pretty strong gray marine business and marine thermal products business. We have a very broad portfolio of marine underwater as well as sonar and other products, so there should be some synergies there. 
There is also going to be synergies in our unmanned products. FLIR is very strong in UAVs and ground-based unmanned vehicles. And of course, we have a tremendous portfolio of underwater vehicles, so we think there might be revenue synergies for both of us there. So that's the beginning, we're kind of looking at it right now. And finally, I'd say FLIR does have an extremely good channel for some of our -- some of their products, which we might be able to enjoy in some of our own infrared products through those channels."

This year, that's gone away, essentially disappeared. So we're making that up with other products, some of it in the solutions business, some of it in marine and some of it in the defense business, especially in the unmanned integrated systems businesses. 
So that kind of sets the tone year-over-year of no growth but being able to offset the $100 million of headwind in UIS -- I mean in ESP. Having said that, I'm going to look forward to just enjoying the same kind of growth that we enjoyed this year, excluding EST. If you take that out of the 1.92, the rest of the portfolio grew about 5% organically.

That's about the best I can do at this time forward this year. We are right now looking at what will happen in the future. Again, let me go back and emphasize one thing. Because of the hockey stick nature of the revenue in Q2 at FLIR, the SG&A for Q2 was significantly lower than it normalized should be.

They've always shipped more in the last 2 weeks of the month than in the first 2 weeks of the month. And the last 2 weeks of the quarter, I should say, in the last 2 weeks of the year. Now we're not exactly totally blameless ourselves. We -- I can't say our revenues are totally linear, but we've worked very, very hard over the years to linearize our revenues within the month and within the quarter, month-over-month, everybody has to report on the revenues and bookings weekly. 
So this is an issue that doesn't have an overnight answer. But we're going to work very hard to introduce some of our own practices, working with the FLIR segment execs, which, by the way, are really outstanding and get that linearize the shipment. The pager of doing that is that you come down to the end of the month or end of the quarter, something happens or something doesn't get shipped, now you've really suffered. You suffered in revenue, you suffered in earnings. So we're going to work on that. 
Let me go back to book-to-bill, the question you asked. In terms of Teledyne, stand-alone first, what I'd call legacy Teledyne at this point. We expect that our book-to-bill in -- will be above 1 especially in instruments, I think it will be about 1.7. That includes very strong orders in marine, as I mentioned, in the second and third quarter. In Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR, it was about 1.16 in Q2. But FLIR is below 1. So combined, we think we'll be slightly over 1 in Q2 by 1.03, 1.04. 
Aerospace and Defense in Teledyne good orders bookings, the book-to-bill is about 1.2. Engineered Systems, which is very lumpy, is about 1.17. So overall, I'd say, including Teledyne FLIR, we're going to be over 1 in Q2, maybe 1.06, 1.07."

In in April, things were started improving with projected organic growth of about 6%. And in this earnings, we've moved that up to 6.6%. That's overall what I would say, legacy Teledyne that excluding the FLIR acquisition. 
If you break that down into its components, instruments, we anticipate with some risks in there, about 6.2%. Digital Imaging, 11.8%, almost 12% for the year, that's our fastest moving business. We think in Aerospace and Defense, especially now, we're seeing a little more recovery in the aerospace businesses. We think that will be about 4.4%, 4.5%. And we see a slight -- decrease in Engineered Systems something of the order of 1.5%, primarily because, as Al said, we don't have the turbine engines for the rest of the year. You roll out of that up, you end up with 6.5%, 6.6%. 
Now if the economy continues to improve at a pace that it's going, especially in our Instrumentation and Digital Imaging businesses, we could improve on that somewhat. But right now, to the best of our ability to project, we're projecting revenue for the year about -- without FLIR, about 3290, and with FLIR about 4582."

The margins were pretty healthy. Overall, Instrumentation margin in Q2, on a non-GAAP basis. The reason I'm doing this non-GAAP is we do have some intangibles that come in all of these groups. And to compare year-over-year, if I do it non-GAAP, excludes Teledyne legacy GAAP -- I mean intangible amortization. Last year, Instrumentation overall margin was 20.4%. This year Q2 is 24%, and we expect to finish the year at 23.2%, which would be almost a 200 basis point improvement, 193 basis point improvement over 2020. 
And I would distribute that to the fact that the mix of businesses are very good. Our environmental businesses are doing very well and our T&M businesses, which have really high margins because of our scopes and, of course, our protocols, those margins are superior. So almost 200 basis point improvement year-over-year in Instruments margin, including Marine is -- we're very happy about that. 
In legacy Digital Imaging, again, our margins for Q2 were really good at 24.4% versus last year's Q2 of 21.5%. We anticipate to end the year, that is excluding Teledyne FLIR, with margins of 23.1% versus last year's of a 21.5%, 21.4%, so an improvement of 175 basis points. FLIR, of course, we had tremendous margin in Q2, just 30%, slightly over. I think that will come down closer to 22% as the year goes on based on the hockey stick nature that I described before. And so overall, Digital Imaging should end up about this year about 22.7% with Teledyne FLIR. 
Our Aerospace and Defense businesses are doing really well. But year-over-year comparisons, we think we will end the year at 18.8% margins, which is 492 basis point improvement over last year. But last year, we took some onetime charges, we took a lot of cost out of that  their aerospace side of the business. But nevertheless, that's almost a 500 basis point improvement in margin, and I expect Engineered Systems to be relatively flat. 
Roll all of that up, we -- from a segment perspective, on a non-GAAP basis, we should enjoy margins of 21.3% based on everything I know right now, versus last year, 18.7%. And if you throw in the corporate expenses, again, I should reiterate on a non-GAAP basis, we'll end up about 20% in margin versus 16.8% last year, which is over 300 basis points improvement. Does that help?"

We are pleasantly impressed with those 3 segments. They have good leadership in the 3 segments with Roger Wells, leading is, or Platen, leading OEM and Components and Roger and Riccard leading to  solution businesses. These are really healthy business. 
From a personal perspective, while I wasn't surprised because we visited them many, many times before the acquisition, I was very pleased, not only with what we've seen, but also their presentations yesterday to the Board were just superb. The fourth subsegment is the one that has some issues. And that's the Surveillance segment, which is about $400 million. 
What's happened there in that segment is that they've had multiple leadership changes, almost annually for the last 4, 5 years. There have been kind of milking that cow for the last few years in terms of cash, and they have not paid attention to new product development as much as they should. In that case, what we've done is we've done something -- we brought in a Teledyne executive that worked for us before back to run that business. We have a Teledyne executive, her name is Gih Fen, G-I-H capital FEN Lei, L-E-I.
We brought her to run the Surveillance business. She used to be one of our executives in in our Digital Imaging business. She went to the government, to DoD, to work in the research and technology groups. She share -- ended up this year as Acting Deputy Secretary for DoD's research and technology programs, which is a huge program. All of the laboratories, all of the businesses. She just joined us 2 weeks ago. I was able to -- fortunate to bring her back. And she has been here 2.5 weeks. She will lead the Surveillance segment, which is the one that we need to work on. And I know she will fix that with Edwin. And we'll get some new products in there and put that on a healthy footing. Having said that, once we solve that, I think the 4 soft segments are going to be superb with the leadership and then -- and with Edwin leading it and then with our combination with the legacy Teledyne with all the synergies we can enjoy. We have great aspirations and hopes for the combined company."

Of course, everybody wants us to give it to them for free so they can test it, but we're not going to do that. So we have high expectations for that. 
But just like, in some ways, a mini version of what we produce the wireless ground many years ago. Overall, on the Aerospace businesses, things are picking up. We are relatively flat quarter -- year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, but things are picking up and we are seeing something like in the second quarter orders, about a 1.2 book-to-bill and that's very healthy for us because that's a high-margin business also.

For over 2 decades now, we've continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded ear",692,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. For over 2 decades now, we've continuously improved our portfolio of businesses, our operations and our financial performance, and along the way, significantly compounded earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns. It is worth noting that just over 10 years ago, a major milestone occurred when we divested our aviation piston engine business and all of its associated liabilities.  
While initiated earlier, immediately following that divestiture, we accelerated our pace of change by making increasingly significant and successful acquisitions within our Digital Imaging and Instrumentation businesses. Our recent acquisition of FLIR accelerates Teledyne's evolution into a more attractive, higher-margin industrial technology company, while at the same time, maintaining our balanced portfolio, primarily focused on commercial markets, but with a resilient and predictable backbone of government businesses. For example, in the second quarter of 2021, 75% of total company sales were derived from U.S. commercial and international customers and 25% of sales from the U.S. government.  
In the past several weeks, we've made rapid progress integrating FLIR by implementing Teledyne processes such as acceleration of financial forecasting and reporting, increasing visibility of sales and costs across the organization, while continuing to enhance FLIR's compliance standards. Furthermore, we've eliminated significant corporate overhead, consultants and other third-party service providers. And as a result, we now expect to achieve our annualized cost savings target of $80 million before the end of 2022 as opposed to 2024, as described in our final merger proxy. 
Turning to the second quarter results. The second quarter was truly a record for Teledyne with sales, operating margin and earnings, that's excluding acquisition-related costs, all of these increased significantly from prior period. We achieved double-digit organic growth for the total company, with sales from Digital Imaging, Environmental and Electronic Test and Measurement, Instrumentation increasing from 17% to nearly 25% year-over-year.  
The operating margin of our legacy businesses collectively was an all-time record. And with FLIR, our non-GAAP operating margin of 22.8% was an all-time record in the second quarter. I should note that very strong non-GAAP margin and earnings performance in Q2 resulted partially from a disproportionate amount of sales from FLIR relative to costs. That is, given FLIR's current lack of linearity shipments, we essentially benefited from 8.5 weeks equivalent of sales volume and contribution margin relative to only 6 weeks of fixed cost.  
In the second half, FLIR's quarterly sales relative to costs were normalized, resulting in somewhat lower margins in all cases, excluding transaction-related expenses. In addition, the average share count in the second quarter only partially reflected the stock issued in connection with the FLIR transaction, which will impact EPS in the second half.  
On a full year basis and after a strong first half, we now think it's reasonable outlook for legacy Teledyne businesses' organic growth in 2021 to be approximately 6.5%, led by forecasted growth of nearly 12% in Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR. With normalized sales for Q3 and Q4, we expect FLIR to contribute sales of just under $1.3 billion in 2021. Collectively, therefore, we now expect reported sales for the year of approximately $4.580 billion.  
Our new outlook, which excludes acquisition-related transactions, transaction and purchase accounting expenses, can be summarized as follows. In April, we provided a GAAP earnings outlook for legacy Teledyne businesses of about $12.10. On a comparable basis, our current outlook is approximately $12.40, which is $0.30 above the earlier outlook. Given the 50 basis points increase in organic growth from 6% to 6.5% today versus April and 40 basis points additional margin improvement, that's resulted in the overall $0.30 increase in our guidance.  
Intangible asset amortization from prior to FLIR transactions divided by the pre-FLIR share count would add around $0.80 to our earnings, resulting in a pre-FLIR outlook of $13.20. Now incorporating FLIR, including its unusually strong partial period performance in Q2 and excluding transaction costs, results in full year 2021 accretion of over $2 per share. And thus, our current non-GAAP outlook is $15.25 to $15.50.  
I will now turn the call over to Al who will comment on the performance of our business segments."

In our Digital Imaging segment, second quarter sales increased 143.9%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth was 17%. Segment operating margin was 14.6% and 27.5% when adjusting for transaction costs and purchase accounting, although this was unusually high, as Robert mentioned earlier. In our Instrumentation segment, overall second quarter sales increased 10.6% versus last year. Sales of environmental instruments increased 19.6% from last year. Sales of most product categories increased and total quarterly sales were just slightly lower than the peak level before the COVID pandemic.  
Sales of Electronic Test and Measurement Systems were exceptionally strong and increased 24.6% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of our marine instrumentation decreased 4.5% in the quarter. However, orders were the strongest in the last 5 quarters with the second quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 33.2%, with segment operating margin increasing over 360 basis points with or without intangible asset amortization.  
Moving to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. Second quarter sales increased 6.5%, driven by an 8.1% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with flat year-over-year sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 62.3% with margins 640 basis points greater than last year. In the Engineered Systems segment, second quarter revenue decreased 1.5%, primarily due to greater sales from missile defense and marine manufacturing programs more than offset by lower sales of electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines as we exited the cruise missile engine business at the end of the first quarter. Despite slightly lower sales, segment operating profit and margin increased slightly when compared with last year.  
I will now turn the call to Sue, who will offer some additional commentary regarding the third quarter and our full year 2021 earnings outlook."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our third quarter and full year 2021 outlook. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $211.3 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs, net of tax, cash from operations was $278.0 million compared with cash flow of $155.8 million for the same period of 2020.  
Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, excluding acquisition-related costs, was $257.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $139.2 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $20.8 million in the second quarter compared to $16.6 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $59.7 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared with $29 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $23.4 million.  
We ended the quarter with approximately $4.05 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.74 billion of debt less cash of $695.1 million. The higher debt balance at July 4, 2021, included the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the FLIR acquisition. Stock option compensation expense was $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2021.  
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $8.05 to $8.45. And on a non-GAAP basis, $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.

As I mentioned before, we think that on a non-GAAP basis, we'll have an upside of about -- with $2 to $2.20 in terms of earnings. If we can maintain that momentum for next year, where we would enjoy probably the full year benefit of the cost reduction, I would say we may be able to increase that to as high as $2.50 from this year's $2 and -- to $2.20. The only reason I say that is the full year dilution we will experience from share count. Our share count in Q3 -- Q2 was 43.7% -- 44 million shares. Next year, full year, we'll have 48 million share count plus as we will have in Q3, Q4 of this year. So there's going to be some of that.  
And frankly, the other side of it, Joe, is that we haven't really had an opportunity to put all of our internal cost reduction inside FLIR for next year yet. These cost reductions we spoke about were generally related to corporate expenses, employee expenses, costs and third-party expenses and consultants. I hope that there'll be other opportunities that we can enjoy over the '22, but it's only 8 weeks in. It's a little hard to predict right now."

Specifically, for example, FLIR has, as you know, a pretty strong gray marine business and marine thermal products business. We have a very broad portfolio of marine underwater as well as sonar and other products, so there should be some synergies there.  
There is also going to be synergies in our unmanned product. FLIR is very strong in UAVs and ground-based unmanned vehicles. And of course, we have a tremendous portfolio of underwater vehicles. So we think there might be revenue synergies for both of us there. So that's the beginning. We're kind of looking at it right now. And finally, I'd say FLIR does have an extremely good channel for some of our -- some of their products, which we might be able to enjoy in some of our own infrared products through those channels."

This year, that's gone away, essentially disappeared. So we're making that up with other products, some of it in the solutions business, some of it in gray marine and some of it in the defense business, especially in the unmanned integrated systems businesses.  
So that kind of sets the tone year-over-year of no growth but being able to offset the $100 million of headwind in UIS -- I mean in ESP. Having said that, if I'm going to look forward to just enjoying the same kind of growth that we enjoyed this year, excluding ESP, if you take that out of the $1.92 billion, the rest of the portfolio grew about 5% organically. So my expectation would be that if everything else being equal and no wheels come off the truck, that we'll be able to enjoy that next year."

That's about the best I can do at this time forward this year. We are right now looking at what will happen in the future. Again, let me go back and emphasize one thing. Because of the hockey stick nature of the revenue in Q2 at FLIR, the SG&A for Q2 was significantly lower than it normalized should be.

They've always shipped more in the last 2 weeks of the month than in the first 2 weeks of the month and the last 2 weeks of the quarter, I should say, than the last 2 weeks of the year. Now we're not exactly totally blameless ourselves. We -- I can't say our revenues are totally linear, but we've worked very, very hard over the years to linearize our revenues within the month and within the quarter, month-over-month. Everybody has to report on the revenues and bookings weekly.  
So this is an issue that doesn't have an overnight answer. But we're going to work very hard to introduce some of our own practices, working with the FLIR segment execs, which, by the way, are really outstanding and get that linearized shipment. The nature of doing that is that you come down to the end of the month or end of the quarter, something happens or something doesn't get shipped, now you've really suffered. You suffered in revenue. You suffered in earnings. So we're going to work on that.  
Let me go back to book-to-bill, the question you asked. In terms of Teledyne, standalone first, what I'd call legacy Teledyne at this point. We expect that our book-to-bill in -- will be above 1. Especially in instruments, I think it will be about 1.07. That includes very strong orders in marine, as Al mentioned, in the second and third quarter. In Digital Imaging, excluding FLIR, it was about 1.16 in Q2. But FLIR is below 1. So combined, we think we'll be slightly over 1 in Q2, about 1.03, 1.04. Aerospace and defense in Teledyne, good orders bookings. The book-to-bill is about 1.2. Engineered Systems, which is very lumpy, is about 1.17. So overall, I'd say, including Teledyne FLIR, we're going to be over 1 in Q2, maybe 1.06, 1.07."

In April, things were started improving with projected organic growth of about 6%. And in this earnings, we've moved that up to 6.6%. That's overall what I would say, legacy Teledyne, excluding the FLIR acquisition. If you break that down into its components, instruments, we anticipate with some risks in there, about 6%, 6.2%. Digital Imaging, 11.8%, almost 12% for the year. That's our fastest moving business. We think in Aerospace and Defense, especially now, we're seeing a little more recovery in our aerospace businesses. We think that will be about 4.4%, 4.5%. 
We see a slight decrease in Engineered Systems, something of the order of 1.5%, primarily because, as Al said, we don't have the turbine engines for the rest of the year. You roll all of that up, you end up with 6.5%, 6.6%. Now if the economy continues to improve at a pace that it's going, especially in our Instrumentation and Digital Imaging businesses, we could improve on that somewhat. But right now, to the best of our ability to project, we're projecting revenue for the year of about -- without FLIR, about $3.290 billion and with FLIR about $4.582 billion."

Yes, marine was a little down, but it was down in revenue. The margins were pretty healthy. Overall, Instrumentation margin in Q2, on a non-GAAP basis -- the reason I'm doing this non-GAAP is we do have some intangibles that come in all of these groups. And to compare year-over-year, if I do it non-GAAP, excludes Teledyne legacy GAAP -- I mean intangible amortization. Last year, Instrumentation overall margin was 20.4%. This year Q2 is 24%, and we expect to finish the year at 23.2%, which would be almost a 200 basis point improvement -- 193 basis point improvement over 2020. And I would distribute that to the fact that the mix of businesses are very good. 
Our environmental businesses are doing very well and our T&M businesses, which have really high margins because of our oscilloscopes and, of course, our protocols, those margins are superior. So almost 200 basis point improvement year-over-year in instruments margin, including marine, is -- we're very happy about that. In legacy Digital Imaging, again, our margins for Q2 were really good at 24.4% versus last year's Q2 of 21.5%. We anticipate to end the year, that is excluding Teledyne FLIR, with margins of 23.1% versus last year's of 21.5%, 21.4%, so an improvement of 175 basis points. FLIR, of course, we had tremendous margin in Q2, just 30%, slightly over. I think that will come down closer to 22% as the year goes on based on the hockey stick nature that I described before. And so overall, Digital Imaging should end up about -- this year about 22.7% with Teledyne FLIR.  
Our Aerospace and Defense businesses are doing really well. But year-over-year comparisons, we think we will end the year at 18.8% margins, which is more a 92 basis point improvement over last year. But last year, we took some onetime charges. We took a lot of cost out of the aerospace side of the business. But nevertheless, that's almost a 500 basis point improvement in margin, and I expect Engineered Systems to be relatively flat. Roll all of that up, we -- from a segment perspective, on a non-GAAP basis, we should enjoy margins of 21.3% based on everything I know right now, versus last year's 18.7%. And if you throw in the corporate expenses, again, I should reiterate on a non-GAAP basis, we'll end up about 20% in margin versus 16.8% last year, which is over 300 basis points improvement.

They have good leadership in the 3 segments with Roger Wells leading UIS, or Clayton leading OEM and Components and Roger -- and Rickard Lindvall leading the solution businesses. These are really healthy businesses. From a personal perspective, while I wasn't surprised because we visited them many, many times before the acquisition, I was very pleased, not only with what we've seen, but also their presentations yesterday to the Board were just superb. 
The fourth subsegment is the one that has some issues. And that's the surveillance segment, which is about $400 million. What's happened there in that segment is that they've had multiple leadership changes, almost annually, for the last 4, 5 years. They have been kind of milking that cow for the last few years in terms of cash, and they have not paid attention to new product development as much as they should. In that case, what we've done is we've done something -- we brought in a Teledyne executive that worked for us before back to run that business. The Teledyne executive -- her name is JihFen, J-I-H-F-E-N, Lei, L-E-I. We brought her to run the surveillance business. She used to be one of our executives in our Digital Imaging business. 
She went to the government to DoD to work in the research and technology groups. She ended up this year as Acting Deputy Secretary for DoD's Research and Technology programs, which is a huge program, all of the laboratories, all of the businesses. She just joined us 2 weeks ago. I was able to -- was fortunate to bring her back. She has been here 2.5 weeks. She will lead the surveillance segment, which is the one that we need to work on. And I know she will fix that with Edwin's help, and we'll get some new products in there and put that on a healthy footing. Having said that, once we solve that, I think the 4 segments are going to be superb with the leadership and with Edwin leading it and then with combination with the legacy Teledyne companies with all the synergies we can enjoy. We have great aspirations and hopes for the combined company."

So we have high expectations for that. Just like in some ways, a mini version of -- I mean to reduce the wireless groundlink many years ago. Overall, on the aerospace businesses, things are picking up. We are relatively flat quarters -- year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, but things are picking up. And we are seeing something like in the second quarter orders, about a 1.3 book-to-bill. And that's very healthy for us because that's a high-margin business also.

Good morning and thank you for joining our earnings call. I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter.

I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter. We achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group but was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter.
Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020.
Cash flow was a third quarter record, allowing repayment of $300 million of debt, while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3% from 3.7% at the end of the second quarter. Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift, and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne.
We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022, as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021.
Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation and other operational challenges. However, to date, we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared with the outlook we presented in July.
On a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in Digital Imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from Digital Imaging, including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments.
In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record, and health care sales returned to pre-pandemic levels. GAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%. But adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting, segment margin was 23.9%.
In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of environmental instruments increased 7.6% from last year, with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter.
Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last 6 quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3%, with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization.
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales, combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year.
Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4%, but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year.
Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin which, excluding acquisition-related charges, is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July.
And now to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook.
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $561.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29; and on a non-GAAP basis, $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020.
I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

Good part of it is we have long-term agreements with some of them. So those would moderate.
As for ourselves, so far this year, we've been able to increase prices on the average about 2%. What that means in some businesses, we can't obviously increase prices because we have long-term contracts, Greg. But in other businesses, we do have the ability to increase prices.
So on the average, we've increased 2%. Our intention is to continue doing that. And perhaps especially next year, we'll start early and see how much elasticity we have in our prices."

Some of the other -- in Digital Imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV, early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our next-generation overhead persistent infrared for FLIR is another one. And the downside, if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MASI, which is the Mission Systems program later this year.

The other thing that we've been successful at is we've combined our oscilloscopes with our protocol analyzers, which saves significant amount of time for engineers that are developing interfaces between products And that's been a real winner for us. So it's a combination. Good market for oscilloscopes, great market for protocol analyzers and an upside when you combine the 2 together with new products."

Yes, I can answer that because we track that one very closely. First, in the quarter, I'd say we probably didn't enjoy about $40 million of revenue that we could have because of shortages. Now we were fortunate because the way our portfolio of business is laid out, as you're very familiar with, we can make some of that up in other places. We have a balanced portfolio, and these shortages are not hitting everything we do.
And by the way, those are not lost sales. They just moved to Q4. We expect to have a similar number in Q4. We're looking at Q1 of next year and see similar issues. So we -- it's kind of a shifting game, but we make it up by pulling in from other parts of our portfolio.
Having said that, we have an extremely active program from our -- the procurement side where we have a major initiative in procurement automation, but we also have procurement working with our -- interestingly, with our suppliers in the Far East who provide us PCBAs. They have access to components that go into those PCBAs, and they're helping us get some of the computer chips and other components that we need. And we also have some dedicated people in the Far East doing the same thing.
So it's a combination. Take the $40 million, push it forward. Then take $40 million from next -- this current quarter, push it forward, pull in some stuff where we can, and kind of, as I said before, we're navigating it. I think so far, we've done okay."

Overall, I think we're holding our own there, and I expect we'd do okay. But again, Andrew, what is -- to me, what's important is even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because [ too focused ] the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our Engineered Systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have, of course, our defense programs in our aerospace and defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3. That may sound modest when you look at the overall growth of 11.9% organic, but I'm happy with that. If we can keep that pace in this time going forward, we should be okay."

I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter. We achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year, driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group but was especially strong in our Commercial Imaging and Electronic Test and Measurement Instrumentation businesses, where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter. 
Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. 
Cash flow was a third quarter record, allowing repayment of $300 million of debt, while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3% from 3.7% at the end of the second quarter. Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift, and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne. 
We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022, as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024 as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021. 
Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation and other operational challenges. However, to date, we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared outlook we presented in July. 
On a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in Digital Imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from Digital Imaging, including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments. 
In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3%, largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record, and health care sales returned to pre-pandemic levels. GAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%. But adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting, segment margin was 23.9%. 
In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test and electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of Environmental Instruments increased 7.6% from last year, with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter. 
Sales of Marine Instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last 6 quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3%, with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points excluding intangible asset amortization. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in Defense, Space and Industrial sales, combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year. 
Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4%, but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year. 
Before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin which, excluding acquisition-related charges, is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July. 
And now to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020. 
Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $561.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29; and on a non-GAAP basis, $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

As for ourselves, so far this year, we've been able to increase prices on the average about 2%. What that means in some businesses, we can't obviously increase prices because we have long-term contracts, Greg. But in other businesses, we do have the ability to increase prices.
So on the average, we've increased 2%. Our intention is to continue doing that. And perhaps especially next year, we'll start early and see how much elasticity we have in our prices."

And then there's the large underwater vehicle that we expect to bid on.
Some of the other -- in Digital Imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV, early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our next-generation overhead persistent infrared for FLIR is another one. And the downside, if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MASI, which is the Mission Systems program later this year.

Yes, I can answer that because we track that one very closely. First, in the quarter, I'd say we probably didn't enjoy about $40 million of revenue that we could have, not because of shortages. No, we were fortunate because the way our portfolio of business is laid out, as you're very familiar with, we can make some of that up in other places. We have a balanced portfolio, and these shortages are not hitting everything we do.
And by the way, those are not lost sales. They just moved to Q4. We expect to have a similar number in Q4. We're looking at Q1 of next year and see similar issues. So we -- it's kind of a shifting game, but we make it up by pulling in from other parts of our portfolio.
Having said that, we have an extremely active program from our -- the procurement side where we have a major initiative in procurement automation, but we also have procurement working with our -- interestingly, with our suppliers in the Far East who provide us PCBAs. They have access to components that go into those PCBAs, and they're helping us get some of the computer chips and other components that we need. And we also have some dedicated people in the Far East doing the same thing.
So it's a combination. Take the $40 million, push it forward. Then take $40 million from next -- this current quarter, push it forward, pull in some stuff where we can, and kind of, as I said before, we're navigating it. I think so far, we've done okay."

Overall, I think we're holding our own there, and I expect we'd do okay. But again, Andrew, what is -- to me, what's important is even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because too focused, the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our Engineered Systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have, of course, our Defense programs in our Aerospace and Defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3. That may sound modest when you look at the overall growth of 11.9% organic, but I'm happy with that. If we can keep that pace in this time going forward, we should be okay."

We achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group, but was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter. 
Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020.

Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift, and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne. 
We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022, as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024, as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021. 
Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation and other operational challenges. However, to date, we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared outlook we presented in July. 
On a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in digital imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from digital imaging, including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments. 
In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3% largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and health care sales returned to prepandemic levels. GAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%, but adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%. 
In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test -- electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of environmental instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last 6 quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year. 
Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4%, but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year. 
But before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin which, excluding acquisition-related charges, is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July. 
And now to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020. 
Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $551.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29 and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

Some of the other -- in digital imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV, early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared OPIR is another one. And the downside -- if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MOSSI, which is the mission systems program.

But again, Andrew, what is -- to me, what's important is, even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because too focused, the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our engineered systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have, of course, our defense programs in our aerospace and defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3.

I'm very pleased with both our operational execution and our financial performance in the third quarter. We achieved record revenue, 75.2% greater than last year driven by organic growth of 11.9% and the remaining 63.3% of sales increase contributed by Teledyne FLIR. Revenue increased organically in every major business group, but was especially strong in our commercial imaging and electronic test and measurement instrumentation businesses, where organic growth for each was greater than 20% in the quarter. 
Furthermore, orders exceeded sales for the fourth consecutive quarter with a third quarter book-to-bill of 1.1. GAAP earnings per share of $2.81 increased 13.3% compared to last year and was $0.03 less than our record GAAP third quarter earnings achieved in 2019. However, excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings were $4.34 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 61.9% on a comparable basis from 2020. 
Cash flow was a third quarter record, allowing repayment of $300 million of debt, while our leverage ratio declined to 3.3x from 3.7x at the end of the second quarter. Teledyne FLIR performed strongly in its first full quarter. Integration efforts have been swift, and we are increasingly excited about the long-term future with Teledyne. 
We continue to accelerate the pace of planned synergies and currently expect to achieve our annualized cost saving target of $80 million before the middle of 2022 as opposed to the end of 2022, as we described in our July earnings call and compared with 2024, as noted when we announced the transaction in January of 2021. 
Regarding our execution in the quarter, Teledyne is not immune to supply chain issues, inflation and other operational challenges. However, to date, we've been successfully navigating and managing these issues. And today, we are pleased to increase our full year sales, margin and earnings outlook compared outlook we presented in July. 
On a full year basis, we now think a reasonable outlook for organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 7% to 7.5%, led by forecasted growth of almost 13% in digital imaging, which excludes Teledyne FLIR. This translates to total sales of $4.59 billion with contribution of $2.4 billion from digital imaging, including FLIR. I will now further comment on the performance of the 4 business segments. 
In our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 217.3% largely due to the FLIR acquisition, but organic growth in our combined commercial and government imaging businesses was also very strong at 17.9%. Sales of industrial and scientific vision systems were a record and health care sales returned to prepandemic levels. GAAP segment operating margin was 12.5%, but adjusted for transaction costs and purchase accounting segment margin was 23.9%. 
In our Instrumentation segment, overall quarter sales increased 9% versus last year. Sales of test -- electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, were exceptionally strong and increased 20.8% year-over-year to record levels. Sales of environmental instruments increased 7.6% from last year with sales related to human health and safety market such as drug discovery and gas and flame detection being strongest in the quarter. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 3.2% in the quarter. In addition, orders were the strongest in the last 6 quarters with a quarter book-to-bill of 1.13. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 24.3% with segment operating margin increasing 270 basis points or 247 basis points, excluding intangible asset amortization. 
In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 11.7% driven by 8.4% growth in defense, space and industrial sales combined with a 27% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products versus last year's pandemic-related tough quarter. GAAP operating profit increased 34.5% with margin 375 basis points greater than last year. 
Finally, in the Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 1.4%, but operating profit and margin declined slightly since we exited the higher-margin turbine engine business earlier this year. 
But before turning the call over to Sue, I want to comment on our margin and earnings outlook. For several years, we've been on a journey to move our overall operating margin from the low teens to over 20%. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made tremendous progress with -- notwithstanding the pandemic and the recent supply chain and inflationary pressures. Today, the approximate $1 increase in our earnings outlook is primarily the result of further improvement in our full year 2021 forecasted operating margin which, excluding acquisition-related charges, is 100 basis points better at approximately 21% from our 20% forecast in July. 
And now to Sue."

I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert, and then I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 outlook. 
In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $192.8 million, including all acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related cash costs net of tax, cash from operations was $194.9 million compared with cash flow of $150.3 million for the same period of 2020. Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures excluding acquisition-related costs, was $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $135.1 million in 2020. 
Capital expenditures were $29.2 million in the third quarter compared to $15.2 million for the same period of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense was $90.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $29.2 million in 2020. In addition, noncash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.89 billion of net debt. That is approximately $4.44 billion of debt less cash of $551.8 million. Stock option compensation expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the same period of 2020. Resulting from the FLIR acquisition, restricted stock unit expense for FLIR employees was $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.53 to $2.69 per share, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. And for the full year 2021, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $9.13 to $9.29 and on a non-GAAP basis $16.35 and to $16.45 compared with our prior outlook of $15.25 to $15.50. The 2021 full year estimated tax rate excluding discrete items is expected to be 23.9%. In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. 
I'll now pass the call back to Robert."

Some of the other -- in digital imaging, we have the wide field of view or what's called WFOV, early warning satellite. That's an opportunity for us. Our Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared OPIR is another one. And the downside -- if there is a downside, is we have to rebid at our NASA program, what we call MOSSI, which is the mission systems program.

I got to tell you that we're holding our own there. Things have moved a little to the right. Probably we’ve got some nice orders especially, for example, in the U.S. border control, where we delivered light vehicle surveillance systems. We have some DARPA program on -- that could lead to other activities in the personal protected biosystems. Overall, I think we're holding our own there, and I expect we'd do okay. 
But again, Andrew, what is -- to me, what's important is, even if you look at our government businesses with FLIR, we have a balanced portfolio. And unfortunately, they may have suffered a little bit because too focused, the portfolio. We have a balanced portfolio between our engineered systems, the FLIR unmanned both ground and air systems and integrated systems. And then we have, of course, our defense programs in our aerospace and defense. So we gained about 3.5% in those programs -- in our government programs in Q3. That may sound modest when you look at the overall growth of 11.9% organic, but I'm happy with that. If we can keep that pace in this time going forward, we should be okay."

But having said that, again, I'll fall back on what we've constructed our portfolio. We get 3% here, 4% there. We get defense. We get energy. We get our short-cycle businesses. And then, of course, digital imaging, we're hitting on all cylinders there. We think we're going to be okay. So there's upside in energy, but I'm not counting on it to move the whole company. The whole company would move because of all the pieces that we have put together that protect us, by the way, on the downside, as you well know, Andrew.

For FLIR today, it's about 24%, which is significantly higher than we've enjoyed historically. And for '21, our overall margin, we expect the non-GAAP margin, which excludes, of course, the intangibles and costs of associated with the purchase accounting.
If you go to 21% and if we can enjoy 50 basis points on top of that, some of the contribution -- serious contribution coming from FLIR, we'd be very happy with that. Again, bear with me on this, Joe. I'm giving you what I'm see in January happening throughout next year. As we get to January, if nothing terrible happens in the world, hopefully, we'll do better.

On the other side, we do have sensors in the A&D segment of FLIR and also especially that -- I meant digital imaging, in general, but we have sensors that are being developed and used computers -- edge computers that are located on various vehicles for detection of high-speed missiles. And if that market starts growing, then we do have a series of products.
And then we have one that I cannot describe too much. We do have a very strong program -- programs, I say, multiple programs in our imaging businesses here in Thousand Oaks, that's the one that locates infrared and other sensors on satellites and space vehicles.
