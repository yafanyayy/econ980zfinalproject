I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles for businesses and communities across the U.S. and globally, and most important, it",1429,"Thanks, Lowell, and hello, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles for businesses and communities across the U.S. and globally, and most important, it has taken a tragic toll on way too many lives. 
Fortunately, there have been some encouraging developments, particularly with the availability of the vaccine. And we're pleased to be doing our part by providing space at Disneyland for one of Southern California's major vaccine distribution sites. To date, more than 100,000 doses have been administered at our location. It's hard to believe nearly a year has passed since the start of the pandemic, which continues to negatively impact the operations of our company. 
For the first quarter, adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.32 a share compared to $1.53 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. During this difficult time, we have made significant changes while finding new and innovative ways to conduct our businesses. But at the same time, we have chartered a course for an even more deliberate and aggressive DTC push for Disney+, ESPN Plus, Hulu and Star. 
I'm really proud of how well our team has performed in the face of a multitude of ongoing challenges, both creatively and across our parks and experiences and legacy and DTC distribution platforms. We've been especially pleased with the success of our direct-to-consumer business. And our recent strategic reorganization has enabled us to accelerate the company's pivot towards a DTC first business model and further grow our streaming services. 
Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations in just over a year since its launch, with 94.9 million subscribers as of the end of the first fiscal quarter. ESPN+ and Hulu have also performed well with 12.1 million and 39.4 million subscriptions, respectively. And on February 23, and we will be launching our new international general entertainment offering, Star across Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Star will offer thousands of hours of movies on television from the company's multiple studios, including content from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox along with Star branded exclusive originals and local programming tailored to specific markets. Star will be integrated into Disney+ as a distinct sixth brand tile. And will offer easy to use parental controls to manage access to the content available on star. We're less than 2 weeks away from launch, and we're seeing tremendous excitement amongst consumers. 
As you saw during our Investor Day presentation, we've got an amazing robust pipeline of original content in development and production for our full portfolio of streaming services. We have some of the best creative fees in the business, and that's reflected in the tremendous appeal of our unparalleled programming. In just the last 2 months, Disney+ has delivered a string of hit programs, including Marvel's incredibly original Wandavision; season 2 of the Mandalorian, which ended with the surprise reveal that fan favorite gold effect will have his own Disney+ series starting this December; and Pixar's artistic triumph, Soul, which debuted on the service and in theaters on Christmas Day to create a claim and has since taken in nearly $100 million at the global box office. 
The wealth of IP from our unrivaled collection of brands and franchises provides us with an incredible breadth and depth of storylines and characters to mine for Disney+ and our other streaming services. We have the ability to interconnect these storylines and characters in unprecedented ways, as we saw with the Mandalorian and Wandavision tying into the broader Star Wars and Marvel franchises. We're excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this unique ecosystem provides. 
The fan response was overwhelming when we announced last week, that Ryan Kugler, whose hard at work on Black Panther 2 will be developing a Black Panther inspired series based in the Kingdom of Wakanda for Disney+ We're also thrilled to be expanding the scope and reach of ESPNs the undefeated by creating a destination on Hulu devoted to black entertainment and culture, another example of our continuing commitment and investment and diversity and inclusion, and we can't wait for the award-winning and critically acclaim film, Nomad Land to be released in theaters and on Hulu on February 19. And on March 5, Disney animation Studios, Ryan and the last Dragon, an artistically beautiful film celebrating e-mail empowerment will arrive in theaters and on Disney+ by a premier axis. As we've said, our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge and let them decide when and how they want to enjoy our one of a kind entertainment offerings. 
Turning to other parts of the company. We've made a number of changes in how we manage and operate our theme parks and consumer products businesses in light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And we believe these and other adjustments will continue to make will best position us to operate more effectively now and in a post COVID environment. 
Where we have been able to reopen our theme parks with limited capacity, guests have consistently demonstrated a willingness and a desire to visit, which we believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the health and safety protocols we put in place. Average daily attendance at Walt Disney World grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, helped in part by the increased capacity we've been able to achieve as a result of our successful protocols. 
It's clear that people want to reconnect with love ones and spend time together doing things they enjoy. And given the demand we're seeing now, we're confident we'll only grow once the pandemic is behind us. Even under difficult circumstances, we've been able to continue expanding our parks. At Walt Disney World Resort, we're hard at work on 2 brand-new attractions at Epcot: Remy's ratio adventure and the highly anticipated Marvel theme rollercoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy, cosmic REWIND. Work is also well underway on the all-new spectacular night time show, Harmonious. This is all part of a much larger reimagining of epcot to make it more Disney, more family friendly, more timeless and more magical. And I'm especially excited about the progress that's been made on the new Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser hotel at Walt Disney world. People are going to be blown away by the experience it is truly unlike anything we've done before. 
At Disneyland resort the exciting new Marvel Theme Land Avengers campus is currently scheduled to open later this year at Disney California Adventure. And crews are hard at work on the highly anticipated state-of-the-art attraction, Mickey and Mini's runaway railway coming to Disneyland in 2023. We're also moving forward on a number of new projects at our international parks. At Shanghai Disneyland, work continues on the first-ever Zootopia themed land. This fully immersive area will seamlessly blend Disney storytelling with advanced technologies, creating a one of a kind experience for our guests. 
Throughout this challenging period, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver world-class programming on all of our platforms, digital and linear. On ABC, we continue to have the #1 returning drop in the key demo of adults 18 to 49 with Grey's Anatomy as well as the top new drama of the fall, Big Sky. Both Gray and Big Sky also hold the top broadcast drama spots on Hulu. 
Also of note, ESPN's first ever NFL wild card mega cast featured 6 networks, including ABC, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes. It was the most extensive multichannel offering to date for an NFL playoff game. In the following day, the team at ESPN pulled off an equally impressive seat with a mega cast of the college football playoff national championship game with 14 different presentations on multiple platforms. 
During an extraordinarily difficult year, our amazing local and national ABC News teams have been doing an absolutely outstanding job. And Good Morning America and World News tonight with David Mer, continue to hold the top spot as the #1 morning show in evening Newscast. While these remain challenging times, we are more confident than ever that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position we're proud of all that we've accomplished, especially as it relates to our top priority, our DTC business, and we believe that the strategic actions we're taking to transform our company will enable us to enhance the consumer and guest experience, grow and expand our businesses and increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Christine."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. In spite of the challenging circumstances we have faced with COVID over the past year, these results reflect the strength of our brands and experiences as well as our ongoing commitment to operate our businesses efficiently. 
This is the first quarter in which we are reporting under our new organizational structure. We filed an 8-K last week with summary recast segment financial information for fiscal 2020. And today's discussion of our financial results will be organized by 2 segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED, and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products or DPP. 
I'll start with our newest segment, DMED, where operating income increased modestly in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our financial reporting structure for DMED includes 3 lines of business. Linear networks, direct-to-consumer and content sales, licensing and other. Operating income at linear networks, which now includes both domestic and international channels decreased versus the prior year quarter due to declines, both domestically and internationally. 
At our domestic channels, the decline in operating income was due to lower results at our cable business, partially offset by an increase in our broadcasting business. The decrease at cable was largely driven by ESPN, where results in the first quarter were significantly impacted by higher rights costs. This was largely due to timing of college football playoff games relative to our fiscal periods as well as higher MDA programming costs. The first quarter included 6 ball games compared to 3 in the prior year quarter. 4 NBA finals games were played in the first quarter due to COVID related timing shifts whereas these games would have typically occurred in the prior fiscal year. ESPN domestic advertising revenue decreased 4% in the quarter due to lower average viewership and the cancellation of certain college sporting events, partially offset by an increase in rates. 
Ad revenue at ESPN is currently pacing down quarter-to-date due in part to the timing of key events. At broadcasting, higher political advertising revenue at our owned television stations drove an increase in operating results versus the prior year. Partially offset by a decrease at the ABC television network. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 3% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
At our international channels, lower results in the quarter were driven by higher programming and production costs and lower affiliate revenue, partially offset by advertising revenue growth and a reduction in nonprogramming costs. Higher programming costs and higher advertising revenue reflected a shift in the timing of Indian premier lean cricket matches due to COVID. And the decrease in affiliate revenue was primarily due to channel closures. However, our international channels results this past quarter were better than the guidance we gave in our last earnings call, primarily due to stronger-than-expected advertising revenue, COVID-related timing shifts of non-Cricket programming and sports rights costs and expense savings. 
Moving on to direct-to-consumer. Improved results at all 3 of our streaming services drove an improvement in direct-to-consumer operating results of nearly $650 million versus the prior year. Last quarter, we guided to direct-to-consumer operating income declining by $100 million versus the prior year under our former segment structure. Our reported results are $750 million higher than that guidance. While some of the outperformance reflects better-than-expected results from Hulu and Disney+, the majority of the variance relates to the elimination of intersegment pricing markups under our new financial reporting structure. 
At Hulu, the improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year was due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Hulu ended the first quarter with 39.4 million paid subscribers, including 4 million Hulu live digital MVPD subscribers. 
Turning to Disney+, a lower loss in the first quarter compared to the prior year was driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by higher costs due to the launch and expansion of Disney. With 94.9 million paid subscribers at the end of Q1, Disney+'s global net additions were $21.2 million versus Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions continued their strong growth trend, with Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, making up approximately 30% of our global subscriber base. We also saw strong additions to our subscriber base from our November launch in Latin America. 
Disney+ overall ARPU this quarter was $4.03. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.37. Higher results at ESPN+ were driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by higher sports programming costs driven by soccer rights. ESPN+ ended the quarter with 12.1 million paid subscribers. Given that we are past the launch year of Disney Plus, we no longer intend to update our DTC subscriber numbers as of our earnings dates. But we will continue to provide you with quarter end subs. We may choose to make additional disclosures when we hit certain milestones. 
Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year due to lower theatrical, TV SVOD and home entertainment results, all consistent with our prior guidance. The decrease in theatrical results reflects no significant worldwide releases in the quarter compared to Frozen 2 in the prior year quarter. 
Lower TV SVOD distribution results were the result of a shift from licensing to third parties to exhibiting our content on our DTC services. A decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in the quarter compared to the performance of Toy Story 4, the Lion King and Aladdin in the prior year quarter. 
I'll now turn to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. We continue to see significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic across many of our businesses. While some operations have resumed, our Parks Experiences and products segment has undoubtedly been hard hit by COVID. 
In the first fiscal quarter, we estimate the pandemic adversely impacted DPEP operating income by approximately $2.6 billion due to revenues lost as a result of closures and reduced operating capacities. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $119 million. 
As a reminder, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for all of the first quarter. Disneyland Resort was closed, and our cruise business was suspended for the full quarter. Disneyland Paris was opened until the end of October or for about 1/3 of the quarter, and Hong Kong Disneyland was open until the beginning of December or for about 2/3 of the quarter. 
Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter, all operated at significantly reduced capacities yet all achieved a net incremental positive contribution for the periods during which they were open, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. 
At Walt Disney World, as Bob mentioned earlier, average daily attendance grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, benefiting from typical seasonality factors as well as solid underlying demand trends. At the same time, our operations team found innovative ways to responsibly increase capacity while still maintaining rigorous COVID protocols. 
Per caps were also up double digits year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the rate of reservation bookings we are seeing in the current quarter. And consumer sentiment around visiting our domestic theme parks over a longer period of time remains strong.
At our consumer Products business, we saw an increase in  operating income in the first quarter driven by an increase in games licensing revenue, which reflects the successful release of Marvel's latest licensed Spider-Man game. As we look ahead, despite continued limited visibility due to the challenges of the pandemic, we would like to give you some context around certain items that may impact our second quarter or full year results. 
First, at our domestic linear networks, we expect ESPN will benefit in the second quarter from the timing of college football and other sporting events, with lower rights costs being partially offset by lower advertising revenue. In Q2, we had only 1 CFP game, which was the National Championship game. This compares to 4 games in the prior year, 3 CFP Bowl games and the National Championship game. Our broadcasting business will be negatively impacted in the second quarter due to lower political advertising versus the prior year. In addition to the shift of the Academy awards to the third quarter. We expect direct-to-consumer operating results in the second quarter to improve modestly versus the prior year quarter. As improvement at Hulu and ESPN+ will be partially offset by increased content investment to support the expansion of Disney we expect that Walt Disney world attendance in the second quarter will be impacted by typical seasonality headwinds in addition to continued COVID-related headwinds and capacity constraints. 
Our current expectation is that Disneyland and Disneyland Paris will be closed for the entirety of the second quarter, but we are hopeful we will be able to reopen Hong Kong Disneyland during the quarter. We have refined our capital spending expectations, and we now expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be roughly comparable to fiscal 2020 spending. Compared to 2020, we still expect to see increased investment at DMED, in corporate and reduced spending at DPP. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

But do you expect to be able to increase capacity limits and fulfill that demand? And as you do, are there things that you've done on the technology or cost side that can help us think about the ramp back to breakeven? 
And then I was just wondering, Christine, is there any way for you to help us think about the sports rights in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20, there's been so much movement in a number of games between the 2 years. And obviously, these are big dollars for the company. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can help us think about that maybe on an annual basis."

In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public.

In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public. That to us seems like the biggest lever that we can have in order to either take the parks that are currently under limited capacity and increase it or open up parks that are currently closed. So that is sort of the gating factor, if you will. As Christine suggested, we have ample demand for our parks. Despite everything that's happening with that pandemic, I think we've made a pretty big impression on our consumer base and prospective guests in terms of the safety measures that we've undertaken at our parks to give assurances to people that they should come in and bring their families. And we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of future bookings. In terms of the cost savings and the technical side of things, not only has our industrial engineering team at Walt Disney world and some of our parks like Shanghai across the world figured out ways to have increased capacity with the same safety measures that we've had in place, which has enabled us to increase our -- or if you will, our attendance. But we have been able to substantially manage our cost side at the same time to rightsize, if you will, are not only our fixed cost base, but also our variable cost base to match what's happening. And I think that's evidenced by what Christine said that all of our parks regardless of what conditions they're operating under, assuming they are operating are in positive net contribution aside. I would also add, you didn't mention this, but I think it's important to add that given those per caps that Christine referenced in terms of the double-digit increase in per caps, this is sort of the ultimate situation where demand has exceeded supply. We've had that been fortunate enough to have that situation for the last couple of years, and we've learned how to yield this business. And I think this is the ultimate situation where we've got supply greater than demand. So not only working on the cost side, but we're also working on the revenue side. And I think you see some of those results at play at Walt Disney World."

Because of what happened with not only cancellations but delays of some of the sporting events you will see some doubling up of some sports rights in this fiscal year. Things like you'll have 2 NBA finals, assuming the season for '21 continues as we expect. You'll also have things like 2 masters, 2 seasons of IPL games. And this all assumes that in fiscal '21, nothing is drastically shifted out. But we -- you can expect the sports rights overall to be up because of the doubling and the shifting into fiscal '21. And that's on linear. When we look at our ESPN+ rights costs, those are up also because we acquired some additional rights, most significantly in soccer that we announced earlier last year."

In terms of the DTC business and so, as you remember, we took it out on Christmas Day, we thought that was a really nice thing to do for our consumer base and our subscriber base given the holiday and given the fact that we have talked consistently about remaining flexible in terms of how we're going to go ahead and put our titles out into the marketplace. We were absolutely thrilled by what that brought to our business in terms of both acquisition and retention. And so I would say it was a big hit with our subscriber base. In terms of Mulan, I think the best thing I can say about Mulan is that it was successful to the extent that we're also using that strategy on Raya. So the individual decisions that we talked about in the future in some fields, we'll take them theatrically. And some films will take them theatrically plus Disney premier access, as is the case with Raya and was the case with Mulan. And in some cases, we'll take a direct to service. It's going to be dependent, though, on what our slate of titles are and whether we think that we need to put something on the service for those particular guests or whether this is something that we could use as another data point in our exploration of Premier Access Day and date with theatrical. So it's really about flexibility, and we're going to steer our decision-making over time given what information that we get from our guests and our subscriber base on what they prefer."

So we did see a bump up when the IPO season started. But we've also made it economical for a consumer to sign up for a 1-year subscription versus going month-to-month. So those are some of the things that we're looking at and utilizing to mitigate the churn that 1 could expect from IPL, but it's a more diversified offering in terms of programming than just cricket."

And I'm curious, sort of maybe some broader commentary about that mix going forward? 
And then my second question is just sort of following up on your comments on churn. Not necessarily looking obviously for a number on term, but maybe just some color about churn in general for Disney+? And how we should think about it in front of the upcoming price increase?"

So in terms of the local partnership -- well, first, I'll talk about the content side because it was a content side element of it as well. There's really 2 things that gate our amount of content that's local in any given market, including Indonesia. And in some cases, there are local requirements for local content as a percentage of the total. So that is 1 factor that plays into it. And the second one is what we think we need from a portfolio standpoint of overall content and as you might suspect, we're pretty aggressively ramping up all of our production for all our local territories. In terms of the partnerships, in Indonesia, we're partnering with telecom cell and we have a lot of data plan and promotional bundling that we're doing with them, which not only is sort of keeping the rates at a place that's respectable in the marketplace given the overall economy there and what the market will bear, but also is giving us exposure possibly from a marketing standpoint and promotional standpoint, to particular audio segments that we may not otherwise be able to get. So -- and in terms of overall churn, are you going to take that one, Christine? Yes. Understand. So in general, we are very pleased with what we've seen so far on the levels of churn. And as our product offering matures and we put more content into the service and our subscriber base becomes more tenured, we expect to see our churn rates continue to decline. So in regard to the specific churn related to the anniversary of the Verizon launch promotion from last November 2020. We're really happy with the conversion numbers that we have seen there going from the promotion to become paid subscribers. We also have that price increase that consumers know about and they're expecting. But we're very comfortable with the price value relationship that we're offering. So we think that the increase will be well received. And we believe that our current and future pricing offers attractive value to consumers. So we feel really good about where we are, but we always want to improve."

I say that because there's nothing like a pandemic to challenge the status quo and make you be fairly introspective about a lot of things. That you've maybe taken as fairly dogmatic. I think you've all seen several new announcements about things that we've done recently that may have been heresy prior to the pandemic, like recasting of our annual Pass program at Disneyland and reconsidering the overwhelming demand we have relative to supply. Everything we do, the first lens we look at is to exceed guest expectations. And it's very tough when your park has more demand and supply, we have to put limits on it. Well, as you know, we have a wide variety margins depending on the nature of the guests and how they visit and when they visit. So with a lens towards maximizing the guest experience, we are now able to essentially reset many pieces of our business, both on the cost and revenue side of the business in order to say, if we had a blank piece of paper, how would we set up our Parks business and be a little bit more aggressive than we typically might be able to be without the impetus of, unfortunately, a year-long closure. So we've had a lot of time to think particularly at Disneyland about what could be, and I think you're about to see some of those strategies be born."

Of course, variable costs will come back in as we ramp up operations, but they've really looked at the way they're doing business, and it's really been quite impressive. So I just want to add that to what Bob's already said. As it relates to Capex, less earnings call, we had said that we expected CapEx to be up from last year. I think the number was $550 million. But now we're expecting it to be relatively flat. What we have here is a couple of dynamics. We'll have increased spending at DMED and corporate, but we're going to have reduced spending at parks. Some of the DMED spending is going to be on things like technology, in infrastructure investments related to the launch of Star. And DPP at our Parks business, obviously, the reason that the CapEx is slowing is because some of the parks are closed, and we've chosen to slow spending there."

In terms of the Super Bowl being down, and as we're going into rights conversations with them, that's obviously something we're considering, but more important than any 1 Super Bowl, we're looking at the long-term trends of sports viewership, the MVPD universe and our own prospects of a potentially a more true ESP and DTC service. So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of elements in that mix, but it's all taking into account the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. What I will say is that we've had a long relationship safe with the n and if we have a deal, if there is a deal that will be accretive to shareholder value, we will certainly entertain that and look at that. But our first filter will be whether it makes sense for our shareholder standpoint going forward. In terms of sports betting, as you probably know, we already have some programming on ESPN around the subject of sports betting. It particularly is attractive to the younger very passionate sports audience that we find. So it's an important piece of what we're doing. We've got relationships with draft teams and caesars we've got sports links with sports betting lease with both of those, not branded Disney or ESPN, obviously, but branded through their own offerings. We've got a studio in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're working on. And we've also got a variety of different things that we're entertaining for the future. So sports betting, we do realize the value in that. We've obviously got some bunkers in terms of our own brand and what we think our own elasticity is in terms of us participating in such endeavors. But we're highly interested in taking the relationships that we have with both parties and taking them to the next level, if that makes sense."

You're absolutely right that there are days, especially holiday periods, where we have to shut our parks for additional entries. Those tend to be days that the park fills up quickly, and we just can't accommodate more people. But that being said, we are currently operating at 35% of that full capacity. And the teams in the park, especially at Walt Disney World, have really figured out a way to be as efficient as possible in operating a park that allows us to get up to that 35% and still maintain all of the protocols for social distancing, for COVID. The -- I think you remember, when we started opening, we started at a level less than 35%, but it was the -- as Bob has already mentioned, industrial engineering that we utilize and just moving people around. The other thing I'd say is when you think about the parks, it's a combination of attendance and per caps when you're looking at revenue. As we've -- as I said in my comments, and I think Bob's alluded to it on the Q&A that we've had really nice growth in per caps. It was double digits, not only on a linked-quarter basis from fourth quarter to first quarter, but also double digits year-over-year. So when you think about per caps and the yield management, we want to have people have a great time when they're in our parks. And when they have a good time, they tend to spend more money. So this is something that we're refining as we go along."

First, I want to ask you about Hulu, the SVOD service on Hulu. Hoping you can maybe share a little bit about the dynamic that's going on there, what the mix of sort of ad-supported versus ad-free subscriber base looks like. And there are a number of these now free ad-supported streaming services that have been growing and being more aggressively populated curious how you see that competitive dynamic playing out. And I want to ask 1 question about sports. Bob, you mentioned the mega cast approach to a couple of your big events. And I'm curious, as you look at your ability to provide that, what's the economic benefit to you? Do you -- is this primarily about putting it in front of more people and therefore, being able to monetize better? Or is there an element of your ability to deliver a mega cast when you were negotiating for content rights, sports rights with the leagues or teams the owners there that you have a somewhat stronger negotiating position relative to your peers?"

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles for businesses and communities across the U.S. and globally, and most important, it has taken a tragic toll on way too many lives.  
Fortunately, there have been some encouraging developments, particularly with the availability of the vaccine. And we're pleased to be doing our part by providing space at Disneyland for one of Southern California's major vaccine distribution sites. To date, more than 100,000 doses have been administered at our location. It's hard to believe nearly a year has passed since the start of the pandemic, which continues to negatively impact the operations of our company.  
For the first quarter, adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.32 a share compared to $1.53 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. During this difficult time, we have made significant changes while finding new and innovative ways to conduct our businesses. But at the same time, we have chartered a course for an even more deliberate and aggressive DTC push for Disney+, ESPN Plus, Hulu and Star. I'm really proud of how well our team has performed in the face of a multitude of ongoing challenges, both creatively and across our parks and experiences and legacy and DTC distribution platforms. We've been especially pleased with the success of our direct-to-consumer business. And our recent strategic reorganization has enabled us to accelerate the company's pivot towards a DTC first business model and further grow our streaming services.  
Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations in just over a year since its launch, with 94.9 million subscribers as of the end of the first fiscal quarter. ESPN+ and Hulu have also performed well with 12.1 million and 39.4 million subscriptions, respectively. And on February 23, we will be launching our new international general entertainment offering, Star, across Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Star will offer thousands of hours of movies and television from the company's multiple studios, including content from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox along with Star-branded exclusive originals and local programming tailored to specific markets. Star will be integrated into Disney+ as a distinct sixth brand tile, and will offer easy to use parental controls to manage access to the content available on Star. We're less than 2 weeks away from launch, and we're seeing tremendous excitement amongst consumers.  
As you saw during our Investor Day presentation, we've got an amazing robust pipeline of original content in development and production for our full portfolio of streaming services. We have some of the best creative teams in the business, and that's reflected in the tremendous appeal of our unparalleled programming. 
In just the last 2 months, Disney+ has delivered a string of hit programs, including Marvel's incredibly original WandaVision; season 2 of The Mandalorian, which ended with the surprise reveal that fan favorite Boba Fett will have his own Disney+ series starting this December; and Pixar's artistic triumph, Soul, which debuted on the service and in theaters on Christmas Day to create acclaim and has since taken in nearly $100 million at the global box office.  
The wealth of IP from our unrivaled collection of brands and franchises provides us with an incredible breadth and depth of storylines and characters to mine for Disney+ and our other streaming services. We have the ability to interconnect these storylines and characters in unprecedented ways, as we saw with The Mandalorian and WandaVision tying into the broader Star Wars and Marvel franchises. We're excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this unique ecosystem provides. 
The fan response was overwhelming when we announced last week that Ryan Coogler, who's hard at work on Black Panther 2, will be developing a Black Panther inspired series based in the Kingdom of Wakanda for Disney+. We're also thrilled to be expanding the scope and reach of ESPN's The Undefeated by creating a destination on Hulu devoted to black entertainment and culture, another example of our continuing commitment and investment in diversity and inclusion, and we can't wait for the award-winning and critically-acclaimed film, Nomadland, to be released in theaters and on Hulu on February 19. And on March 5, Disney Animation Studios Raya and the Last Dragon, an artistically beautiful film celebrating female empowerment, will arrive in theaters and on Disney+ via our Premier Access. 
As we've said, our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge and let them decide when and how they want to enjoy our one of a kind entertainment offerings. 
Turning to other parts of the company. We've made a number of changes in how we manage and operate our theme parks and consumer products businesses in light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And we believe these and other adjustments we'll continue to make will best position us to operate more effectively now and in a post-COVID environment.  
Where we have been able to reopen our theme parks with limited capacity, guests have consistently demonstrated a willingness and a desire to visit, which we believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the health and safety protocols we put in place. Average daily attendance at Walt Disney World grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, helped in part by the increased capacity we've been able to achieve as a result of our successful protocols.  
It's clear that people want to reconnect with loved ones and spend time together doing things they enjoy. And given the demand we're seeing now, we're confident we'll only grow once the pandemic is behind us. Even under difficult circumstances, we've been able to continue expanding our parks. At Walt Disney World Resort, we're hard at work on 2 brand-new attractions at Epcot, Remy's Ratatouille Adventure and the highly anticipated Marvel-themed rollercoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. 
Work is also well underway on the all-new spectacular nighttime show, Harmonious. This is all part of a much larger reimagining of Epcot to make it more Disney, more family friendly, more timeless and more magical. And I'm especially excited about the progress that's been made on the new Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser hotel at Walt Disney World. People are going to be blown away by the experience. It is truly unlike anything we've done before.  
At Disneyland Resort, the exciting new Marvel-themed land Avengers Campus is currently scheduled to open later this year at Disney California Adventure. And crews are hard at work on the highly anticipated state-of-the-art attraction, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway coming to Disneyland in 2023. 
We're also moving forward on a number of new projects at our international parks. At Shanghai Disneyland, work continues on the first-ever Zootopia-themed land. This fully immersive area will seamlessly blend Disney storytelling with advanced technologies, creating a one of a kind experience for our guests.  
Throughout this challenging period, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver world-class programming on all of our platforms, digital and linear. On ABC, we continue to have the #1 returning drama in the key demo of adults 18 to 49 with Grey's Anatomy as well as the top new drama of the fall, Big Sky. Both Grey's and Big Sky also hold the top broadcast drama spots on Hulu.  
Also of note, ESPN's first ever NFL Wild Card MegaCast featured 6 networks, including ABC, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes. It was the most extensive multichannel offering to date for an NFL playoff game. In the following day, the team at ESPN pulled off an equally impressive seat with a MegaCast of the college football playoff national championship game with 14 different presentations on multiple platforms.  
During an extraordinarily difficult year, our amazing local and national ABC News teams have been doing an absolutely outstanding job. And Good Morning America and World News Tonight with David Muir continue to hold the top spot as the #1 morning show and evening newscast. 
While these remain challenging times, we are more confident than ever that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. We're proud of all that we've accomplished, especially as it relates to our top priority, our DTC business, and we believe that the strategic actions we're taking to transform our company will enable us to enhance the consumer and guest experience, grow and expand our businesses and increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Christine."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. In spite of the challenging circumstances we have faced with COVID over the past year, these results reflect the strength of our brands and experiences as well as our ongoing commitment to operate our businesses efficiently.  
This is the first quarter in which we are reporting under our new organizational structure. We filed an 8-K last week with the summary recast segment financial information for fiscal 2020. Today's discussion of our financial results will be organized by 2 segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products or DPEP.  
I'll start with our newest segment, DMED, where operating income increased modestly in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our financial reporting structure for DMED includes 3 lines of business: Linear networks; direct-to-consumer; and content sales, licensing and other. Operating income at linear networks, which now includes both domestic and international channels, decreased versus the prior year quarter due to declines, both domestically and internationally.  
At our domestic channels, the decline in operating income was due to lower results at our cable business, partially offset by an increase at our broadcasting business. The decrease at cable was largely driven by ESPN, where results in the first quarter were significantly impacted by higher rights costs. This was largely due to timing of College Football Playoff games relative to our fiscal periods as well as higher NBA programming costs. The first quarter included 6 CFP ball games compared to 3 in the prior year quarter. 4 NBA finals games were played in the first quarter due to COVID-related timing shifts, whereas these games would have typically occurred in the prior fiscal year. 
ESPN domestic advertising revenue decreased 4% in the quarter due to lower average viewership and the cancellation of certain college sporting events, partially offset by an increase in rates. Ad revenue at ESPN is currently pacing down quarter-to-date due in part to the timing of key events. At broadcasting, higher political advertising revenue at our owned television stations drove an increase in operating results versus the prior year, partially offset by a decrease at the ABC television network. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 3% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.  
At our international channels, lower results in the quarter were driven by higher programming and production costs and lower affiliate revenue, partially offset by advertising revenue growth and a reduction in non-programming costs. Higher programming costs and higher advertising revenue reflected a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League cricket matches due to COVID. And the decrease in affiliate revenue was primarily due to channel closures. However, our international channels results this past quarter were better than the guidance we gave in our last earnings call, primarily due to stronger-than-expected advertising revenue, COVID-related timing shifts of non-cricket programming and sports rights costs and expense savings.  
Moving on to direct-to-consumer. Improved results at all 3 of our streaming services drove an improvement in direct-to-consumer operating results of nearly $650 million versus the prior year. Last quarter, we guided to direct-to-consumer operating income declining by $100 million versus the prior year under our former segment structure. Our reported results are $750 million higher than that guidance. While some of the outperformance reflects better-than-expected results from Hulu and Disney+, the majority of the variance relates to the elimination of intersegment pricing markups under our new financial reporting structure.  
At Hulu, the improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year was due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Hulu ended the first quarter with 39.4 million paid subscribers, including 4 million Hulu live digital MVPD subscribers.  
Turning to Disney+, a lower loss in the first quarter compared to the prior year was driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by higher costs due to the launch and expansion of Disney+. With 94.9 million paid subscribers at the end of Q1, Disney+'s global net additions were 21.2 million versus Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions continued their strong growth trend, with Disney+ Hotstar subscribers making up approximately 30% of our global subscriber base. We also saw strong additions to our subscriber base from our November launch in Latin America.  
Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.03. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.37. Higher results at ESPN+ were driven by subscriber growth, partially offset by higher sports programming costs driven by soccer rights. ESPN+ ended the quarter with 12.1 million paid subscribers. Given that we are past the launch year of Disney+, we no longer intend to update our DTC subscriber numbers as of our earnings dates. But we will continue to provide you with quarter end subs. We may choose to make additional disclosures when we hit certain milestones.  
Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year due to lower theatrical, TV SVOD and home entertainment results, all consistent with our prior guidance. The decrease in theatrical results reflects no significant worldwide releases in the quarter compared to Frozen 2 in the prior year quarter.  
Lower TV SVOD distribution results were the result of a shift from licensing to third parties to exhibiting our content on our DTC services. A decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in the quarter compared to the performance of Toy Story 4, The Lion King and Aladdin in the prior year quarter.  
I'll now turn to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. We continue to see significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic across many of our businesses. While some operations have resumed, our Parks, Experiences and Products segment has undoubtedly been hard hit by COVID.  
In the first fiscal quarter, we estimate the pandemic adversely impacted DPEP operating income by approximately $2.6 billion due to revenues lost as a result of closures and reduced operating capacities. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $119 million.  
As a reminder, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for all of the first quarter. Disneyland Resort was closed, and our cruise business was suspended for the full quarter. Disneyland Paris was opened until the end of October or for about 1/3 of the quarter, and Hong Kong Disneyland was open until the beginning of December or for about 2/3 of the quarter.  
Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter all operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved a net incremental positive contribution for the periods during which they were open, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening.  
At Walt Disney World, as Bob mentioned earlier, average daily attendance grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, benefiting from typical seasonality factors as well as solid underlying demand trends. At the same time, our operations team found innovative ways to responsibly increase capacity while still maintaining rigorous COVID protocols.  
Per caps were also up double digits year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the rate of reservation bookings we are seeing in the current quarter. And consumer sentiment around visiting our domestic theme parks over a longer period of time remains strong. 
At our consumer products business, we saw an increase in  operating income in the first quarter, driven by an increase in games licensing revenue, which reflects the successful release of Marvel's latest licensed Spider-Man game. As we look ahead, despite continued limited visibility due to the challenges of the pandemic, we would like to give you some context around certain items that may impact our second quarter or full year results.  
First, at our domestic linear networks, we expect ESPN will benefit in the second quarter from the timing of college football and other sporting events, with lower rights costs being partially offset by lower advertising revenue. In Q2, we had only 1 CFP game, which was the National Championship game. This compares to 4 games in the prior year, 3 CFP Bowl games and the National Championship game. 
Our broadcasting business will be negatively impacted in the second quarter due to lower political advertising versus the prior year, in addition to the shift of The Academy awards to the third quarter. We expect direct-to-consumer operating results in the second quarter to improve modestly versus the prior year quarter, as improvement at Hulu and ESPN+ will be partially offset by increased content investment to support the expansion of Disney+. We expect that Walt Disney world attendance in the second quarter will be impacted by typical seasonality headwinds in addition to continued COVID-related headwinds and capacity constraints.  
Our current expectation is that Disneyland and Disneyland Paris will be closed for the entirety of the second quarter, but we are hopeful we will be able to reopen Hong Kong Disneyland during the quarter. We have refined our capital spending expectations and we now expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be roughly comparable to fiscal 2020 spending. Compared to 2020, we still expect to see increased investment at DMED, in corporate and reduced spending at DPEP.
and with that, I'll now hand the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

In particular, Christine mentioned strong underlying demand. But do you expect to be able to increase capacity limits and fulfill that demand? And as you do, are there things that you've done on the technology or cost side that can help us think about the ramp back to breakeven? 
And then I was just wondering, Christine, is there any way for you to help us think about the sports rights in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. There's been so much movement in a number of games between the 2 years. And obviously, these are big dollars for the company. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can help us think about that maybe on an annual basis."

In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public.

In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public. That to us seems like the biggest lever that we can have in order to either take the parks that are currently under limited capacity and increase it, or open up parks that are currently closed. So that is sort of the gating factor, if you will. 
As Christine suggested, we have ample demand for our parks. Despite everything that's happening with that pandemic, I think we've made a pretty big impression on our consumer base and prospective guests in terms of the safety measures that we've undertaken at our parks to give assurances to people that they should come in and bring their families. And we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of future bookings. 
In terms of the cost savings and the technical side of things, not only has our industrial engineering team at Walt Disney World and some of our parks like Shanghai across the world figured out ways to have increased capacity with the same safety measures that we've had in place, which has enabled us to increase our, if you will, our attendance. But there, we have been able to substantially manage our cost side at the same time to rightsize, if you will, out -- not only our fixed cost base, but also our variable cost base to match what's happening. And I think that's evidenced by what Christine said that all of our parks, regardless of what conditions they're operating under, assuming they are operating, are in positive net contribution side. 
I would also add, you didn't mention this, but I think it's important to add that given those per caps that Christine referenced in terms of the double-digit increase in per caps, this is sort of the ultimate situation where demand has exceeded supply. We've had that -- been fortunate enough to have that situation for the last couple of years, and we've learned how to yield this business. And I think this is the ultimate situation where we've got supply greater than demand. So not only working on the cost side, but we're also working on the revenue side. And I think you see some of those results at play at Walt Disney World."

Ben, now to address sports rights and the shifting between fiscal years. Because of what happened with not only cancellations but delays of some of the sporting events you will see some doubling up of some sports rights in this fiscal year. Things like you'll have 2 NBA finals, assuming the season for '21 continues as we expect. You'll also have things like 2 Masters, 2 seasons of IPL games. And this all assumes that in fiscal '21, nothing is drastically shifted out. But we -- you can expect the sports rights overall to be up because of the doubling and the shifting into fiscal '21. And that's on linear. When we look at our ESPN+ rights costs, those are up also because we acquired some additional rights, most significantly in soccer that we announced earlier last year."

In terms of the DTC business and Soul, as you remember, we took it out on Christmas Day, we thought that was a really nice thing to do for our consumer base and our subscriber base given the holiday and given the fact that we have talked consistently about remaining flexible in terms of how we're going to go ahead and put our titles out into the marketplace. We were absolutely thrilled by what that brought to our business in terms of both acquisition and retention. And so I would say it was a big hit with our subscriber base. 
In terms of Mulan, I think the best thing I can say about Mulan is that it was successful to the extent that we're also using that strategy on Raya. So the individual decisions that we talked about in the future, in some films, we'll take them theatrically. And some films, we'll take them theatrically plus Disney Premier Access, as is the case with Raya and was the case with Mulan. And in some cases, we'll take it direct to service. It's going to be dependent, though, on what our slate of titles are and whether we think that we need to put something on the service for those particular guests or whether this is something that we could use as another data point in our exploration of Premier Access same date with theatrical. So it's really about flexibility, and we're going to steer our decision-making over time given what information that we get from our guests and our subscriber base on what they prefer."

And then second one is what we think we need from a portfolio standpoint of overall content. And as you might suspect, we're pretty aggressively ramping up all of our production for all our local territories. 
In terms of the partnerships, in Indonesia, we're partnering with Telkomsel and we have a lot of data plan and promotional bundling that we're doing with them, which not only is sort of keeping the rates at a place that's respectable in the marketplace given the overall economy there and what the market will bear, but also is giving us exposure possibly from a marketing standpoint and promotional standpoint to particular audience segments that we may not otherwise be able to get.

I say that because there's nothing like a pandemic to challenge the status quo and make you be fairly introspective about a lot of things that you've maybe taken as fairly dogmatic. I think you've all seen several new announcements about things that we've done recently that may have been heresy prior to the pandemic, like recasting of our annual pass program at Disneyland and reconsidering the overwhelming demand we have relative to supply. 
Everything we do, the first lens we look at is to exceed guest expectations. And it's very tough when your park has more demand than supply, we have to put limits on it. Well, as you know, we have a wide variety of margins depending on the nature of the guest and how they visit and when they visit. So with a lens towards maximizing the guest experience, we are now able to essentially reset many pieces of our business, both on the cost and revenue side of the business in order to say, if we had a blank piece of paper, how would we set up our parks business and be a little bit more aggressive than we typically might be able to be without the impetus of, unfortunately, a year-long closure. So we've had a lot of time to think, particularly at Disneyland, about what could be, and I think you're about to see some of those strategies be born."

Of course, variable costs will come back in as we ramp up operations, but they've really looked at the way they're doing business, and it's really been quite impressive. So I just want to add that to what Bob has already said. 
As it relates to CapEx, last earnings call, we had said that we expected CapEx to be up from last year. I think the number was $550 million. But now we're expecting it to be relatively flat. What we have here is a couple of dynamics. We'll have increased spending at DMED and corporate, but we're going to have reduced spending at Parks. Some of the DMED spending is going to be on things like technology, in infrastructure investments related to the launch of Star, and DPEP at our Parks business. Obviously, the reason that the CapEx is slowing is because some of the parks are closed, and we've chosen to slow spending there."

So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of elements in that mix, but it's all taking into account the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. 
What I will say is that we've had a long relationship with the NFL, and if we have a deal, if there is a deal that will be accretive to shareholder value, we will certainly entertain that and look at that. But our first filter will be whether it makes sense for our shareholder standpoint going forward. In terms of sports betting, as you probably know, we already have some programming on ESPN around the subject of sports betting. 
It particularly is attractive to the younger very passionate sports audience that we find. So it's an important piece of what we're doing. We've got relationships with DraftKings and Caesars. We've got sports links with -- sports betting links with both of those, not branded Disney or ESPN, obviously, but branded through their own offerings. We've got a studio in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're working on. And we've also got a variety of different things that we're entertaining for the future. 
So sports betting, we do realize the value in that. We've obviously got some bumpers in terms of our own brand and what we think our own elasticity is in terms of us participating in such endeavors. But we're highly interested in taking the relationships that we have with both parties and taking them to the next level, if that makes sense."

You're absolutely right that there are days, especially holiday periods, where we have to shut our parks for additional entries. Those tend to be days that the park fills up quickly and we just can't accommodate more people. But that being said, we are currently operating at 35% of that full capacity. And the teams in the park, especially at Walt Disney World, have really figured out a way to be as efficient as possible in operating the park that allows us to get up to that 35% and still maintain all of the protocols for social distancing, for COVID. 
The -- I think you'll remember, when we started opening, we started at a level less than 35%, but it was the -- as Bob has already mentioned, industrial engineering that we utilize and just moving people around. The other thing I'd say is when you think about the parks, it's a combination of attendance and per caps when you're looking at revenue. As we've -- as I said in my comments, and I think Bob's alluded to it on the Q&A that we've had really nice growth in per caps. It was double digits, not only on a linked-quarter basis from fourth quarter to first quarter, but also double digits year-over-year. So when you think about per caps and the yield management, we want to have people have a great time when they're in our parks. And when they have a good time, they tend to spend more money.

And any reason not to believe that we won't sort of get back to '19 revenues, assuming that the economy is fine and all that?"

We have no doubt that when we reopen up in parks that were closed, or increase the capacity, that we'll have some level of social distancing and mask wearing for the remainder of this year. That's our expectation. 
But I believe that Dr. Fauci said earlier today that he hopes that there's vaccines for everyone who wants them by April this year. If that happens, that is a game changer. And that could accelerate our expectations and give people the confidence that they need to come back to the parks. Will there be some overlap until we know that we've hit herd immunity? Sure, there will. But do we also believe that we'll be in the same state of 6-foot social distancing and mask wearing in '22? Absolutely not."

And I want to ask 1 question about sports. Bob, you mentioned the MegaCast approach to a couple of your big events. And I'm curious, as you look at your ability to provide that, what's the economic benefit to you? Do you -- is this primarily about putting it in front of more people and therefore, being able to monetize better?

It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 and compared to $0.60 last",1869,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 and compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery while also fueling long-term growth. 
Our strategic focus continues in 3 key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new, high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones at the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition as consumers begin to return to theaters and I'll talk more about the specifics later. 
Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government-mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies and other offerings. 
We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland 2 weeks ago, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street U.S.A. on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our cast and guest bases and feel the excitement in the air. It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed cast and retrain them to be able to operate for the state of California's new health and safety requirements. 
We continue to see strong growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney And they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols. 
At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long fifth anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY '19 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing in Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all-new Avengers campus which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. 
I have a chance to visit recently and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney wish to the public with a virtual live stream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing, and it includes the Aqua Miles water ride, the first-ever Disney attraction at Sea. The Disney Wish will set sale on its maiden voyage in 2022 and bookings opened to the general public on May 27. 
On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios, consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and search like pictures where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 50 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms. 
We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's No land took home Oscars for best best Director with Chloe Shao, becoming the first woman of color to win the award and best picture. That's 5 best picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Picks our stellar record of award-winning films continues with the studio's animated masterpiece sold, which took home Oscars for best animated feature and best original score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy sole on Disney+ and NoMad land on Hulu. 
As we have consistently stated, Flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy, and we have outlined 3 approaches for distributing our films, releases and theaters with a simultaneous offering by a Disney+ Premier Access, release it straight to Disney+ and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Colella will be released in theaters and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28, followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively at Disney+ on June 18. 
The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theaters and on Disney+ by a premier access on July 9; and Disney's Jungle Cruise, a hilarious venture field expedition, will be available in theaters and on Disney+ premier Axis on July 30. 
I'm pleased to announce today that admits recent signs of increased consumer confidence in moviegoing. 2 films, 20th Century's exciting Comedy, Free Guy and Marvel's Action Adventure, Shanxi and the Legend of the 10 rings will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. 
Like our films, our Disney+ original series had become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian followed by Marvel's Wanda Vision and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zig guys. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof. 
The second season of High School Musical, The Musical, the series, The all-new the mysterious panic society based on the popular young adult book series and the animated series monsters at work are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months. Just to name a few. 
We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment, and we continue to deliver the high-quality one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+, which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of $230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. 
Looking at our entire portfolio streaming services We expect that as full production levels resume and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output would help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN Plus Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter. 
On Hulu, buzzworthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hu original film, the United States versus Billy Holiday and Season 4 of the handmade tail, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for Hulu original and there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, MODEC, Season 2 of the hit series Love Victor and season 10 of the wildly popular anthology American Horse story on FX on Hulu. 
In March, we launched ESPN Plus on Hulu, and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN Plus are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN Plus programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight championship bite airing live on ESPN Plus pay-per-view on May 15, the final match of the FA Cup also on May 15, followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon and the highly anticipated third UFC match-up between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10. 
Not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more, call it fickle in the fall. Live sports are a very important component of our content business and even amidst the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivaled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business, given the important economic value it drives for the company, we are also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering. And with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals, others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga and the NHL. 
For example, as part of the 7-year rights deal with the NHL 5 of the league's live national games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu and ESPN Plus will be the sole home for more than 1,000 a out-of-market NHL games, further cementing the service as a must-have for hockey fans. 
And today, I'm excited to announce 2 additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday night baseball games and opening night annually. Coverage of the highly anticipated potential expanded wildcard series and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+. 
We've also signed historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish Club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leaks, including a number of the top clubs in the world and 1 of the best players in the world, Lines, And this 8-year deal covering both English and Spanish language rights brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga 2 matches per season to ESPN+ beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+ position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content. It's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible. 
We believe in the power of live sports and are confident our multiplatform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses. And we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMD and DPF businesses. 
I'll walk through our results by segment, starting with media and entertainment distribution, Operating income at this segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher results across all of the segments lines of business. At linear networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and Broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 
ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cable's growth this quarter. The decrease programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the college football playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only 1 CFP ballgame, the National Championship compared to 4 in the prior year quarter, three, CFP bowl games and the National Championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. 
At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by lower ratings for key programming in addition to the timing of the college football playoffs. Quarter-to-date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year. benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At Broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC, partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. 
At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards, partially offset by higher rates. 
On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our owned stations would negatively impact broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series in addition to a number of other smaller factors. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. 
Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our Networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and STAR in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but -- or in the second quarter this year due to COVID-related timing shifts. 
Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu and ESPN+. 
The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from $39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to $3.8 million from $4 million at the end of Q1. And which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. 
At ESPN+, improved year-over-year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our annual meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March, so we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA and and a domestic price increase toward the end of the quarter. 
We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate, the launch of the Star General Entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions making up approximately 1/3 of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. 
As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1, and there were no games in Q2. The pilcurrent IPL tournament began on April 9 in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99, Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61 
As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+ and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales, licensing and other operating income at Med increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. 
Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. 
Moving on to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. D CAP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at Consumer Products was more than offset by lower results at parks and experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to increases at our merchandising games licensing businesses. The parks and experiences results were again adversely affected by COVID-19-related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. 
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. 
Our Parks and Resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World, attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again, grew by double digits versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30, and And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. 
Forward-looking bookings for Park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, the Masters, Wimbledon and the European Football Championship. which compares to Q3 of last year, during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. 
At our Direct-to-cOnsumer business, we now plan to launch STARs our stand-alone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga and the Premier League. Championship games for the Copa, Libertad ores, the prominent regional international soccer competition, along with grand slam tennis. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, We remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 23' million to 260 million subs. powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year given the COVID-related suspension of the IPL season and our decision to move the Stars Latin America launch to the fourth quarter, we remain very optimistic about our future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

But we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the Parks, and that's flowing through the Park's cash numbers and we're also seeing good strong cash flow from our Direct-to-Consumer businesses. So those 2 elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for.

Yes, I'll take them both. So on the first one, in terms of the drivers for sub growth going forward, we really see 4 different elements. First of all, is our content slate As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises. in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. The second one is our general entertainment international groups, driven by our Star brand, and we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for our international territories as well as Disney+. The third 1 is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing Malaysia today, as June 1 in Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it But 1 thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S. be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the 4 components that continue to drive us. and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of '24. In terms of the Parks and when we're going to sort of be able to raise Park capacity limits. We've already started that given the guidance that just came today from the CDC and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, We've already started to increase our capacities. Those obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks. anymore, both outdoors and indoors. is very big news for us particularly if anybody has been in Florida in the middle of summer with [indiscernible] That could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that were able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that."

But you've seen the margins very healthy. Our yield is growing up from a very healthy standpoint. Consumers are spending more, and we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters because everything has become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand. We've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time.

In terms of Park and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But 1 of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a Park loyalty program, an affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy And as you know, the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously. and was 1 of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure or a particular guest came in. with the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs. We have the chance to make even more advancements not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience, no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high-demand day or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple of quarters. But I don't think we even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs in terms of making sure, again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time, get an adequate return to our shareholders. the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals, and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms and things like Hulu and ADC. So that's actually been envisioned, and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of the Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the leagues understand that, and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests does well."

But that choice with respect to sports streaming, feels like it's still a couple of years off in terms of pivoting ESPN as a business completely towards streaming. So could you just talk about the longer-term vision now that your sports portfolio is in place. How should we think about ESPN relative to ESPN+? And how you're thinking about the transition being accretive overall? And secondly, I guess, Christine, the guidance around the second half cadence for DTC subs.

But if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we negotiated in to go to these Direct-to-Consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN Plus in terms of the Direct-to-Consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that."

And that's something that we're in conversations with and we're we're considering and we're thinking about it. Obviously, it's an attractive property, but we'll only do it just like our other rights if it is something that adds shareholder value. And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for and we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far, and we'll take that same approach going forward. In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports books, links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We see that as an opportunity. We know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually It builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follow sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully. But we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area."

And one of those methods is a simultaneous release on in the theaters and premium access. And I can understand during COVID when it was very unlikely that people would be in theaters, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like it's going to be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us some insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window?"

If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor our consumers ready to go back in the theaters, of course, 90%, let's say, of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of pulling in terms of that growing going forward. But if you look at last weekend's box office for an example, And you compare versus an average of the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically in 63% below or 67% below internationally. So we know the market is not quite there yet. So the Disney Premier Access strategy, 1 of the things that gives us right now. And we're grateful for. This is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to re prime the pump, if you will, But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a pack theater that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+ or which ones will go into theaters. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery the theatrical marketplace, and we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."

It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year",1858,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery while also fueling long-term growth.  
Our strategic focus continues in 3 key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new, high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition as consumers begin to return to theaters, and I'll talk more about the specifics later.  
Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government-mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies and other offerings.  
We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland 2 weeks ago, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street U.S.A. on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our casts' and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. 
It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed casts and retrain them to be able to operate to the state of California's new health and safety requirements.  
We continue to see strong, growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney, and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols.  
At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long fifth anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY '19 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. 
Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all-new Avengers campus which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit recently, and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. 
We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish, to the public with a virtual live stream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing, and it includes the Aqua Miles water ride, the first-ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sale on its maiden voyage in 2022, and bookings opened to the general public on May 27. 
On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios, consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and search like pictures where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 50 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms.  
We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for Best Actress, Best Director, with Chloe Zhao, becoming the first woman of color to win the award, and Best Picture. That's 5 Best Picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, Flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy, and we have outlined 3 approaches for distributing our films: releases in theaters with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access, releases straight to Disney+, and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theaters and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28; followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively at Disney+ on June 18.  The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9. And Disney's Jungle Cruise, a hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access on July 30. 
I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in moviegoing, 2 films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. 
Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian, followed by Marvel's Wanda Vision and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof.  
The second season of High School Musical, The Musical, The Series, The All-New, The Mysterious Benedict Society, based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work, are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few.  
We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment, and we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+ which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.  
Looking at our entire portfolio of streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resume and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output would help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter.  
On Hulu, buzzworthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, and Season 4 of the Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu Original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K, season 2 of the hit series Love, Victor, and season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu.  
In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu, and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+ are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC Lightweight Championship fight airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15; the final match of the FA Cup also on May 15; followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC match-up between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10.  
Not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more, call it football in the fall. Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even amidst the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivaled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business given the important economic value it drives for the company, we are also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering. And with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. 
With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals; others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga and the NHL. For example, as part of the 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the league's live national games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games, further cementing the service as a must-have for hockey fans.
And today, I'm excited to announce 2 additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball, with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday night baseball games and opening night annually, coverage of the highly anticipated potential expanded wildcard series and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+.  
We've also signed historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world and 1 of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal covering both English and Spanish language rights brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga 2 matches per season to ESPN+ beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible.  We believe in the power of live sports and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future.

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMD and DPF businesses. 
I'll walk through our results by segment, starting with Media & Entertainment Distribution. 
Operating income at this segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher results across all of the segment's lines of business. At linear networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 
ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cable's growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only 1 CFP ballgame, the National Championship, compared to 4 in the prior year quarter, 3 CFP ballgames and the National Championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. 
At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by lower ratings for key programming in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter-to-date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. 
At Broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC, partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. 
At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards, partially offset by higher rates. 
On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our owned stations would negatively impact Broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall Broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series in addition to a number of other smaller factors. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. 
Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our Networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and STAR, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but -- or in the second quarter this year due to COVID-related timing shifts. 
Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu and ESPN+. 
The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from $39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1 which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. 
At ESPN+, improved year-over-year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our annual meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March, so we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA, and a domestic price increase toward the end of the quarter. 
We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate, the launch of the Star General Entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately 1/3 of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1, and there were no games in Q2. 
.
The current IPL tournament began on April 9 in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99, Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61 As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. 
Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+, and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. 
Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. 
Moving on to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at Consumer Products was more than offset by lower results at parks and experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to increases at our merchandising games licensing businesses. The parks and experiences results were again adversely affected by COVID-19-related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. 
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. 
Our Parks and Resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. 
At Walt Disney World, attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double digits versus the prior year. 
Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30. And  as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. 
Forward-looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At linear networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, the Masters, Wimbledon and the European Football Championship. which compares to Q3 of last year, during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer business, we now plan to launch STAR+, our stand-alone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America, on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga and the Premier League. Championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition, along with Grand Slam tennis. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, We remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year given the COVID-related suspension of the IPL season and our decision to move the Star+ Latin America launch to the fourth quarter, we remain very optimistic about our future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

I have to say that we're extremely pleased with how the market reacted to both. In the U.S., we've not observed any significantly higher churn rate since the price increase in EMEA. As we added Star as a sixth brand title, we've actually seen an improvement in our churn rate. So we seem to be fairly resilient to those price increases. And as such, I think it makes us feel relatively bullish going forward that we still offer a tremendous price value relationship across the world for Disney+."

But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, and we look at it actually weekly. But I'm also looking at it versus fiscal '19, which I consider a more normalized year. 
I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World. And we really don't have the impact of Disneyland yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks, and that's flowing through the park's cash numbers. And we're also seeing good, strong cash flow from our Direct-to-Consumer businesses. So those 2 elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. 
And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year because of some of the shifts in sports rights, expense timing from last year to this year, but we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year. But we're looking at a more favorable free cash flow than we did when we started off the year."

So on the first one, in terms of the drivers, for sub growth going forward, we really see 4 different elements. First of all is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. The second one is our general entertainment international growth, driven by our Star brand, and we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for our international territories as well as Disney+. 
The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing Malaysia today, as June 1 in Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. 
But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S. be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the 4 components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of '24. 
In terms of the parks and when we're going to sort of be able to raise  our capacity limits. We've already started that given the guidance that just came today from the CDC and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those -- obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us, particularly if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on. That could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. 
So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that we're able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that."

And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement.

It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as they had thought.

But you've seen the margin's very healthy. Our yield is growing up from a very healthy standpoint. Consumers are spending more. And we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters because everything has become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand. We've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. 
And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously, one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get more and more cast members back. It thrills us to be able to do that, but we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests."

I'm going to talk about -- Jessica, I'm going to talk about Direct-to-Consumer and the slower net adds expected for the second half of the year. 
That is, in fact, the case. And it is largely due to the COVID-related suspension of the IPL and also that decision that we made to move the Star+ Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. 
The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India if that plays out like we just said. 
But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S. as well as EMEA for Disney+. So our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S. at the end of March, and we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters."

The first, you started touching on it a bit with the last series of questions. But I think one of the core thesis is that coming out of the pandemic, the potential that the parks at Disney are more profitable than pre-pandemic. And  you talked about some of those drivers. One of them perhaps when the parks return to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? 
So one, I'm just curious if you agree with that thesis that the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic that it was going in. 
And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious, under what circumstances will you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Friday Night Football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+?"

In terms of park and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But 1 of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our  tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of A Park loyalty program, an affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know, the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure or a particular guest came in. 
With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high-demand day or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple of quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs in terms of making sure, again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time, get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. 
In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals, and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms and things like Hulu and ADC. So that's actually been envisioned, and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of the Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the leagues understand that, and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well."

But that choice with respect to sports streaming, feels like it's still a couple of years off in terms of pivoting ESPN as a business completely towards streaming. 
So could you just talk about the longer-term vision now that your sports portfolio is in place? How should we think about ESPN relative to ESPN+? And how are you thinking about the transition being accretive overall?

Our longer-term vision is to parallel path both ESPN and ESPN+. But if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we negotiated in to go to these direct-to-consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN+ in terms of the Direct-to-Consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that."

Obviously, it's an attractive property, but we'll only do it just like our other rights, if it is something that adds shareholder value. And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for, and we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far, and we'll take that same approach going forward. 
In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports books, links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We see this as an opportunity. We know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follows sports because it's such an integral part of the experience.

And one of those methods is a simultaneous release in the theaters and premium access. 
And I can understand during COVID when it was very unlikely that people would be in theaters, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like it's going to be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us some insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. 
And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window?"

But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. 
In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor our consumers ready to go back in the theaters. Of course, 90%, let's say, of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of pulling in terms of that growing going forward. 
But if you look at last weekend's box office, for an example, And you compare versus an average of the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically, and 63% below -- or 67% below internationally. So we know the market's not quite there yet. 
So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for it, is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to re-prime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theater, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. 
In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theaters. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace, and we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."

Today, I'd like to start off by talking about our company's priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney's nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special connection to audiences and guests, and our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world's most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world's most talented creators. 
As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers' connection to our characters and stories, and we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience. We are executing against these priorities and the results clearly speak for themselves. 
Looking across the company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses despite the challenges presented by the ongoing, ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. 
At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we're encouraged by some of the positive trends we're seeing and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. 
At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcome the first guest to our reimagined Marvel theme hotel in Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-time, Star Wars themed Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of ECOT, we'll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular harmonious. 
Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for U.K. residents and a Disney Dream set sale on its first U.S.-based crews this week. 
Future bookings for all of our ships remained strong, with bookings in the third quarter, in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sale in summer of 2022. 
As our Parks business continues its recovery and we see demand growth, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests and will be available starting on August 25. 
The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. Additionally, we've made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools creating a revolutionary new multitiered service we're calling Disney Genie that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We're very, very excited about this new service, and we'll be providing additional details soon. The goal of Disney GE, which will appear in a user-friendly app is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice.

74 Million subscriptions. Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar's Zika and Marvel's Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November. 
The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we're excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we've said, our direct-to-consumer business is the company's top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service, our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. 
This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ day with an unprecedented company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. 
On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 6-episode Beetles documentary Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel's Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Haley Steinfeld; the Mandalorian spin-off, the book of Bolsa and National Geographics, Welcome to Earth with Will Smith. 
With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a 3-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus premier access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel's Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic. 
Both Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a phone by phone basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents. 
We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel's newest action adventure, Changi and the Legend of the 10 Rings on September 3. The highly anticipated live-action musical, Westside Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is the Kingsman, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios in Compal an incredibly heartwarming story set into magical talent in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable Lin-Manuel Miranda. 
Our Marvel slate includes 4 future films in fiscal 2022. The all-new Eternals alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones adventure starring Harrison Ford, is due in the summer as is the origin story of another Intrepid Explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. 
It's a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they're visiting one of our parks or watching what are our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value. 
Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world's best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises. And the Parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, E",1720,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continue to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as that consumer products. 
Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At Parks and Experiences, we continue to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. 
Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland in Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and 0 days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was opened for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. 
Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per caps up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. 
Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per cap as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge and Avengers campus. 
Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders. 
At Consumer Products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise based on several of our key franchises, including Micky and Mini, Star Wars, including the Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter. 
Moving on to our media and entertainment distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at linear networks and content sales, licensing and other. At linear networks, operating results were lower at both our domestic and international channels. 
At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball. 
In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At Broadcasting, lower results from the ABC television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. 
The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. 
At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4 to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We're not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in a quarter in which the Olympics were held. 
At Broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9 until the season was postponed on May 4 versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19. 
Turning to Direct-to-Consumer. Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from $41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. 
Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately $104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2. 
Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber reflecting the roughly 4 weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2. 
At ESPN, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. 
The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Sol in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen 2, ONWARD, Call of the Wild and Ford versus Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales. 
The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At linear networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year's benefit from the 53rd week. 
The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the company which primarily impacted our linear networks. 
At content sales, licensing and other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing. 
We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic Parks and Resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. 
And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. Longer term, we do anticipate that both dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. 
However, for the time being, we don't anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

One is, I wanted to understand how the company is thinking about near-term theatrical releases given the steep fall off in second week box, rises variant, international markets still unopened. So why not delay or pause release schedule? And then secondly, on DTC profits, I guess, more Hulu profits. It looks like continually they're getting better than expected. I think you turn profitable this quarter with Hulu. 
So I'm wondering why that improvement and why not revisit maybe some of the guidance that we shared earlier on DTC profitability, just given the continual improvement and it looks like Hulu profitability."

And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we're executing right now, we did not anticipate nor did I think anybody the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace. 
At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shanxi, that's going to be a title that we're going to put in the marketplace or free guy, that's going to be a title that we're going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, 3 months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go. 
And while some of that's uncertain, I think in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we've got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you've got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we're going to do, and that's where we ended up on Shanxi and Friege, which our next 2 titles out."

So we don't have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shanxi, we think it's actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it's got only a 45-day window for us. So the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to the service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I'll refer back to my previous answer. When we plan Shanxi that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn't be possible."

The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. 
So those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are just like all of our other streaming services, they're ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So we're very pleased with what's going on at Hulu, but we're not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal '22 annual operating plan.

And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So we're still bullish about our Park business going forward. I may also suggest as a bridge to the second question that we've implemented a reservation system that's going to enable us to spread our demand increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived. And frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we're making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we've been able to extract over the last few quarters.

That's going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. Essentially, what it's going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we've got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time, lead to substantial commercial opportunities as the guest navigates their base.

Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven't specifically quantified it but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There's that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it because I think it's a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. So I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that's going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It's scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it's only 1 because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content, library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So we feel really good about not only the IPL but also star -- Hotstar. In LatAm, we will be LATAM, the launch for LATAM is in later this quarter.

And that seems consistent with commentary that you mad",174,"So 2 questions. It's certainly nice to see the U.S. Parks profitable in fiscal 3Q. And I note that operating expenses are back at 81% of 2019 fiscal 3Q levels, while revenues about 60% of 2019 levels. And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the Parks? Can we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it's variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that's how we should think about modeling the parks going forward? 
And then the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn training in the quarter? What was the impact of STAR as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated."

And then Christine, you may want to jump in on that as well. 
Okay. In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We've got world-class content from the world's best storytellers plus our international launches plus the power of the Disney bundle, and you asked the question about churn. We're really pleased with churn. We've taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you're seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by EUR 2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. So our retention is very healthy across the globe. We're really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we're offering our guests when you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There's something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we're making in our international territories and it's really a price value proposition that is really great. So the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high. Our retention is so high amongst the local quarters where we're taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. 
In terms of -- and I'll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we've got all 3 of our hotels open, for example. We've got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So you can see that we're not quite 100% available at this point. But I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies and operating become much, much higher. So I think you'll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don't know if you want to elaborate."

Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we're all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We're very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way. But also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior 4 years later and certainly didn't know about COVID at the time. So we're dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. What I will say is that just like we've done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we've figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feel satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we've entered into hundreds of talented arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they've gone very, very smoothly. So we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety in the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we're releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately, the fate has delivered us. But we're trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who's in the value chain, if you will, feels like they're having their contractual commitments honored both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I'll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we've launched Disney+ around the world in Japan, we've done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that's about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?"

You noticed that across the world, we've got different business models. We've got different business models for 2 reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it's Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with STAR as a 6 brand title looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we're in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we're taking all this into account. There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability do what long term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don't know what's ideal yet. I will say that we're extremely pleased in every market that we've launched our direct-to-consumer services. We've exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So in terms of the way that we've approached the market so far, it's worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But we're going to continue to learn.

Looking across the company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses despite the challenges presented by the ongoing, ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we're encouraged by some of the positive trends we're seeing and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. 
At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcomed the first guest to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel in Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind, Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of Epcot, we'll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular, Harmonious. 
Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for U.K. residents and as Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remains strong, with bookings in the third quarter, in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022. 
As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand growth, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program, at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests and will be available starting on August 25. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. 
Additionally, we've made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools creating a revolutionary new multitiered service we're calling Disney Genie that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We're very, very excited about this new service, and we'll be providing additional details soon. The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. 
They'll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available and more time having fun. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million, 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions. 
Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar's Luca and Marvel's Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November.  
The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we're excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we've said, our direct-to-consumer business is the company's top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. 
And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 6-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel's Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian spin-off, The Book of Boba Fett; and National Geographic's Welcome to Earth with Will Smith.
With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a 3-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus Premier Access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel's Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic.
Both Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a film by film basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents.  
We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel's newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, on September 3. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is The King's Man, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set in the magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable, Lin-Manuel Miranda.  
Our Marvel slate includes 4 feature films in fiscal 2022: the all-new Eternals alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones adventure starring Harrison Ford is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another intrepid explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It's a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they're visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value.  
Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world's best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises. And a parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, E",1719,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products. 
Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At Parks and Experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was open for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. 
At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per caps up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. 
Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per caps as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Avengers Campus. Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders.  
At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey & Minnie, Star Wars, including The Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney Stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter.  
Moving on to our media and entertainment distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and content sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball.  
In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At Broadcasting, lower results from the ABC Television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. 
Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4 to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We're not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in a quarter in which the Olympics were held.  
At Broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and, in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9 until the season was postponed on May 4 versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19.  
Turning to direct-to-consumer, Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  
Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU.  
As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately 104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2.  
Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber reflecting the roughly 4 weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2.  
At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DME decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen 2, Onward, Call of the Wild and Ford v Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales.  
The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year's benefit from the 53rd week.  
The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the company which primarily impacted our Linear Networks. At content sales, licensing and other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing.  
We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. 
Longer term, we do anticipate that both dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don't anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

I think you turned profitable this quarter with Hulu. So I'm wondering why that improvement and why not revisit maybe some of the guidance that we shared earlier on DTC profitability, just given the continual improvement it looks like in Hulu profitability."

We've said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we're executing right now, we did not anticipate nor did I think anybody the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace.  
At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that's going to be a title that we're going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy. That's going to be a title that we're going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, 3 months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go.  
And while some of that's uncertain, I think in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we've got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you've got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we're going to do, and that's where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next 2 titles out."

So we don't have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shang-Chi, we think it's actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it's got only a 45-day window for us. So the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I'll refer back to my previous answer. When we plan Shang-Chi that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn't be possible."

The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. So those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are -- just like all of our other streaming services, they're ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So we're very pleased with what's going on at Hulu, but we're not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal '22 annual operating plan.

And the primary noise that we're seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So we're still bullish about our park business going forward. 
I may also suggest as a bridge to the second question that we've implemented a reservation system that's going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived and, frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we're making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we've been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that's only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system."

Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double digits, and this quarter was even stronger. If you look at -- when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have -- even though Walt Disney World has been open now for over a year, we're still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park. So in addition to all the technology things that we're implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we're just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable.

And I'm just wondering if you think there's a real transformation ahead for the business as you take advantage of the last year plus of downtime to reinvent the experience? Just maybe add some context, would be helpful."

MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie, though, is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That's going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. 
Essentially, what it's going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we've got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities for us as the guest navigates their days. So it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint."

We haven't specifically quantified it but I would",326,"Okay. Ben, I'll try to go through your -- hopefully I can remember them all. So Hulu. Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven't specifically quantified it but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There's that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it because I think it's a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. 
So I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that's going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It's scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it's only 1 because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content -- library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+. In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don't have any updates to anything new on the sports side."

And I note that operating expenses are back at 81% of 2019 fiscal 3Q levels, while revenues about 60% of 2019 levels. And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the parks? Can we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it's variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that's how we should think about modeling the parks going forward? 
And then the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn training in the quarter? What was the impact of Star as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated."

In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We've got world-class content from the world's best storytellers plus our international launches plus the power of the Disney bundle, and you asked the question about churn. We're really pleased with churn. We've taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you're seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America, where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by EUR 2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. 
So our retention is very healthy across the globe. We're really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we're offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, there's something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we're making in our international territories and it's really a price value proposition that is really great. So the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local quarters where we're taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. 
In terms of -- and I'll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we've got all 3 of our hotels open, for example. We've got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So you can see that we're not quite 100% available at this point. But I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies in operating become much, much higher. So I think you'll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don't know if you want to elaborate."

Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we're all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We're very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior 3, 4 years later and certainly didn't know about COVID at the time. So we're dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. 
What I will say is that just like we've done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we've figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feel satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we've entered into hundreds of talent arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they've gone very, very smoothly. So we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety in the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we're releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately the fate has delivered us. 
But we're trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who's in the value chain, if you will, feels like they're having their contractual commitments honored both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I'll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we've launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we've done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that's about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?"

While I can't comment on some of the specific percentages that you're probably looking for and -- but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. 
You noticed that across the world, we've got different business models. We've got different business models for 2 reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it's Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America, tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a sixth brand tile looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we're in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we're taking all this into account. 
There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability to do what long term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don't know what's ideal yet. I will say that we're extremely pleased in every market that we've launched our direct-to-consumer services. We've exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So in terms of the way that we've approached the market so far, it's worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But we're going to continue to learn.

Today, I'd like to start off by talking about our company's priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney's nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special connection to audiences and guests, and our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world's most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world's most talented creators. 
As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers' connection to our characters and stories, and we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience. We are executing against these priorities and the results clearly speak for themselves. 
Looking across the company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses despite the challenges presented by the ongoing, ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we're encouraged by some of the positive trends we're seeing and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. 
At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcomed the first guest to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel in Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind, Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of Epcot, we'll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular, Harmonious. 
Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for U.K. residents and as Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remains strong, with bookings in the third quarter, in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022. 
As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand growth, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program, at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests and will be available starting on August 25. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. 
Additionally, we've made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools creating a revolutionary new multitiered service we're calling Disney Genie that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We're very, very excited about this new service, and we'll be providing additional details soon. The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. 
They'll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available and more time having fun. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million, 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions. 
Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar's Luca and Marvel's Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November.  
The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we're excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we've said, our direct-to-consumer business is the company's top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. 
And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 6-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel's Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian spin-off, The Book of Boba Fett; and National Geographic's Welcome to Earth with Will Smith.
With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a 3-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus Premier Access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel's Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic.
Both Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a film by film basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents.  
We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel's newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, on September 3. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is The King's Man, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set in the magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable, Lin-Manuel Miranda.  
Our Marvel slate includes 4 feature films in fiscal 2022: the all-new Eternals alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones adventure starring Harrison Ford is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another intrepid explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It's a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they're visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value.  
Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world's best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises. And a parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, E",1719,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I'll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products. 
Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At Parks and Experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was open for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. 
At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per caps up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. 
Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per caps as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Avengers Campus. Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders.  
At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey & Minnie, Star Wars, including The Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney Stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter.  
Moving on to our media and entertainment distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and content sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball.  
In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At Broadcasting, lower results from the ABC Television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. 
Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4 to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We're not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in a quarter in which the Olympics were held.  
At Broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and, in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9 until the season was postponed on May 4 versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19.  
Turning to direct-to-consumer, Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  
Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU.  
As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately 104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2.  
Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber reflecting the roughly 4 weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2.  
At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content sales, licensing and other operating income at DME decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen 2, Onward, Call of the Wild and Ford v Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales.  
The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year's benefit from the 53rd week.  
The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the company which primarily impacted our Linear Networks. At content sales, licensing and other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing.  
We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. 
Longer term, we do anticipate that both dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don't anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

We've said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can, given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we're executing right now, we did not anticipate nor did I think anybody the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace.  
At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that's going to be a title that we're going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy. That's going to be a title that we're going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, 3 months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go.  
And while some of that's uncertain, I think in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we've got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you've got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we're going to do, and that's where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next 2 titles out."

So we don't have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shang-Chi, we think it's actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it's got only a 45-day window for us. So the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I'll refer back to my previous answer. When we plan Shang-Chi that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn't be possible."

Hulu exceeded our expectations, and it was profitable this quarter. There's a couple of things going on here. One is, it has had continued to have subscriber growth and also very strong advertising revenue. The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. So those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are -- just like all of our other streaming services, they're ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So we're very pleased with what's going on at Hulu, but we're not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal '22 annual operating plan.

And the primary noise that we're seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So we're still bullish about our park business going forward. 
I may also suggest as a bridge to the second question that we've implemented a reservation system that's going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived and, frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we're making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we've been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that's only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system."

But the per caps, in my comments, I referred to them as exceptionally strong. And I would not use that word were it not for the fact that they were exceptional. Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double digits, and this quarter was even stronger. If you look at -- when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have -- even though Walt Disney World has been open now for over a year, we're still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park. So in addition to all the technology things that we're implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we're just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable. And the guest experience is something that we're going to be focused on, especially as we continue to reopen."

MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie, though, is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That's going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. 
Essentially, what it's going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we've got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities for us as the guest navigates their days. So it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint."

Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven't specifically quantified it but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There's that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it because I think it's a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. 
So I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that's going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It's scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it's only 1 because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content -- library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+. In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don't have any updates to anything new on the sports side."

And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the parks? Can we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it's variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that's how we should think about modeling the parks going forward? 
And then the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn training in the quarter? What was the impact of Star as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated."

In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We've got world-class content from the world's best storytellers plus our international launches plus the power of the Disney bundle, and you asked the question about churn. We're really pleased with churn. We've taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you're seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America, where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by EUR 2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. 
So our retention is very healthy across the globe. We're really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we're offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, there's something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we're making in our international territories and it's really a price value proposition that is really great. So the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local quarters where we're taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. 
In terms of -- and I'll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we've got all 3 of our hotels open, for example. We've got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So you can see that we're not quite 100% available at this point. But I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies in operating become much, much higher. So I think you'll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don't know if you want to elaborate."

Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we're all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We're very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior 3, 4 years later and certainly didn't know about COVID at the time. So we're dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. 
What I will say is that just like we've done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we've figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feel satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we've entered into hundreds of talent arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they've gone very, very smoothly. So we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety in the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we're releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately the fate has delivered us. 
But we're trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who's in the value chain, if you will, feels like they're having their contractual commitments honored both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I'll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we've launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we've done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that's about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?"

While I can't comment on some of the specific percentages that you're probably looking for and -- but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. 
You noticed that across the world, we've got different business models. We've got different business models for 2 reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it's Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America, tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a sixth brand tile looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we're in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we're taking all this into account. 
There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability to do what long term we might feel was ideal.

We've exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So in terms of the way that we've approached the market so far, it's worked really, really well.

As we learn, though, we're finding out there's tremendous seasonality in this business that we may not have known about before we really got into it, at least in terms of above expectations. Also, I want to caveat that our sub adds aren't necessarily going to be linear. I think a lot of the marketplace expects these things to sort of be a straight-line math, and it's not really turning out that way. And as we've indicated before, we do believe our first half adds this fiscal year will be stronger than the second half adds. That said, we really feel great about our trajectory.

As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it has been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company, as we've made great strides in reopening our business while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. 
Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22 we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original and enduring stories; second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories; and lastly, using the power of our far-reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible. 
I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: direct-to-consumer, sports and parks experiences and products. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services, Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continued to perform incredibly well with 118.1 million, 17.1 million and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48% and Disney+ subs in particular, by 60%. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long term, not quarter-to-quarter, and we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between $230 million and $260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year. 
This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day, a global company-wide celebration.  We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel's Shanxi and the Legend of the 10 Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure Jungle Cruise and hilarious new short form The Simpsons and the first 5 episodes of Season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, the World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. 
On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24, and  the latest Star Wars adventure, the book of Bubet on December 29. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of the Beatles, Get Back. Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week, and Disney's Encanto, which premiers in theaters on November 24, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. 
In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September. This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our Investor Conference 2.0. 
We recognize that the single most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content, and we are singularly focused on making new high-quality entertainment including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340-plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 billion and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. 
We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world. The service is now available throughout Japan, and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea and Taiwan and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we are now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50-plus additional countries, including in Central Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. 
Turning to sports. We continue to build out ESPN Plus with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact,  all 7 of the major deals we made in the last 1.5 years included a streaming component. Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night wildcard game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL. 75  of the league's national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu.  And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers because live sports are a key element and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. 
The 90% of the most watched telecasts last year were sports and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record with an increase of 54% over the 2019, 2020 season opening to later. And we are particularly pleased with the NHL's direct-to-consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay-per-views coming in the past year. At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcasts like the hugely popular Monday night football with Peyton and Neeli, which airs on ESPN2 and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the Arena, Tom Brady, the multipart docu series about the legendary quarterback premiering ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcasts. 
We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reach and scale, we have the potential to partner with third parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports and all of this, the rights deals, our innovative programming and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. One of the things that sets the Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our parks around the world open to guests albeit with some limits on capacity and the return of our entire Disney Cruise line. 
At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our parks were closed to reengineer and reimagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney day. 
In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with legacy annual pass holders, while also attracting new pass holders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new pass holders, and most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers: Dream Key and Believe Key, with Dream Key selling out in just 2 months. We're also seeing a great response to the new annual passholder program at Walt Disney World, a testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. 
Walt Disney World rolled out its new multitiered gold service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time lining in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon. 
Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves.  We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at Epcot, which has quickly become one of the park's top attractions, our new themed restaurant, Phase 220 and 2 new nighttime spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming months, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the Galaxy, COSMIC REWIND and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Star Cruiser experience. As part of the immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience. 
Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish, in June of 2022, and we'll welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment, driven by a premium price point well above the industry average. Before leaving our parks and experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our consumer products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, Shop Disney and on more compelling retail partnerships such as Disney Store Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year. 
In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before with our new offerings, and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way only Disney can. Our company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of emerging technology and insights gained through our enumerable consumer touch points is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience, Steve Bolt Will, the first Cartoon with synchronized sound our groundbreaking development and use of audio and Medtronic. We were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005, and Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation. These are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling, without boundaries in our own Disney Metaverse.  And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences and global reach, we see limitless potential and that makes us as excited as ever about the Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain item",2053,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $2.29 or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pretax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the media and entertainment distribution segment creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with parks experiences and products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. 
A profitable fourth quarter at parks and experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. In the prior year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 4 weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double digits versus Q3 and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. 
Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend with per caps in the fourth quarter, up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019. Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we are looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, Keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. 
At our Cruise Line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to see with guest ratings as strong as prepandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing. And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sale in June 2022 with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. 
At Consumer Products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles: Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. 
Turning to our media and entertainment distribution segment. Fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year. driven by lower results at linear networks, direct-to-consumer and content sales, licensing and other. At linear networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at linear networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million, driven by a decrease at in our domestic channels, partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. 
At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ADC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays.  As we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. 
At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors: one, lower affiliate revenue, primarily driven by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week; two, an increase in marketing costs from more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter, and finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19-related timing impacts from the prior year. 
Costs decreased from the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year, partially offset by increased costs for college football games. Domestic linear networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year, driven by our cable networks and owned television stations, both of which were impacted by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week. ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year as higher rates were offset by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week.  First quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7-point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
International channel results increased versus the prior year, driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At direct-to-consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu.  At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in subscription and premier access revenue. Higher subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing and the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher premier access revenue was driven by Black Widow and jungle crews in Q4 compared to Milan in the prior year quarter. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3, in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, grew by almost $4 million from Q3 to Q4 and Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 on versus third quarter, continuing to benefit from recent price increases. At ESPN+, where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and to a lesser extent, marketing costs. 
Google ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. GoLive subscribers increased to $4 million from $3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. 
Moving on to content sales, licensing and other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million driven by lower theatrical and TV SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as Drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. while theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases. Lower TV SVOD results were due to lower third-party content licensing of film content, driven by the ongoing impact of COVID as well as our strategic shift towards distribution on our DTC services, partially offset by higher income from sales of episodic content due to lower write-offs versus the prior year. To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion, or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. For fiscal '22, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021, driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish as well as other increased spending at DPEP and corporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed prepandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus prepandemic levels, including, for example, inflationary pressure on wages, costs related to new projects and initiatives such as Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus and the EPCOT expansion and a ramp-up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion. 
And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are a few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we are seeing in the theatrical market paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter, which had only 2 releases. 
At linear networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year, reflecting factors including higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL timing of cricket expenses at Star India and an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue. 
Finally, as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year, but we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases. -- the fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have tentpole content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo all in one quarter. This includes highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Gandor and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year. 
As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together, and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022 and we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect that Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021 as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve the subscriber target of $230 million to $260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectation that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions."

One of them is the Disney+ net adds. The other is probably more recently on Park's margins. And you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks, but maybe you could just spend a minute really on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net adds being higher in '23 and '24 than in '22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot. 
And then on the Parks front, Bob, you've talked a lot about Park's margins when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before. But obviously, there's also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So maybe you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue. So we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this sort of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic."

But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter-to-quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered not necessarily by the content, but by the number of ads that we have in terms of markets or number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160  by FY '23, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. 
Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint. Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch and the hunger for content for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic and you have to shut down production that's not a good combination. And yet we identified the need for the content way back exactly a year ago. and have prepared a very strong cadence of content, which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. In terms of the park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think it was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen. There was a reference -- and I'm not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest per day. And that is a very, very material increase for us in per caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney business, both in terms of reiterance of guidance that has been given today. But additionally, in terms of where our parks business is going to go from a demand standpoint once we completely clear the pandemic but also in terms of the -- what we expect to be long-lasting benefits in terms of yields.

And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of of some others that may be newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the parks expenses are in 3 buckets: fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. What you see this fourth quarter is  on the overall margin for the global business for DPEP and that's a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre-COVID levels. I've said this before, and I'll say it again that I believe that we will get not only back to but have a high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing, we're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield demand, giving capacity on any given day or week during the year. And on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. And those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who've been to our parks since we reopened, really enjoy that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels Lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual cues for selected attractions. And we're once again really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guest movements throughout the park. So while these margins will remain impacted, while we're still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe over the long term that these fundamental changes are going to -- are going to result in higher margins overall. So thanks for asking that question. And the other thing I would say, as Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie, we have launched in -- Well Disney World. We have not yet launched it. in Disneyland. And I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland people who come to visit Disneyland, the response will be as strong, if not stronger."

As you know, we have reached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. And the extent to which we had a number of titles released going to theatrical will eventually go to Disney+. But what we're seeing is some recovery of the theatrical exhibition marketplace, which is a good thing, by the way, for not only Disney, but also for the industry. And because most of the franchises that we've had as a well Disney company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution. At the same time, we're watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back, and we're watching very carefully our family films as they're released over the next couple of months. to make sure that, that market will come back to theatrical exhibition as the general entertainment, let's say, the films that appeal to a younger target audience have come back. And so we're sticking with our plan of flexibility because we're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical first window. I should say that you'll notice that the films that we are putting into the marketplace in theatrical that our family films have a fairly short window at least in terms of any reference point to what history might have been. And we're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+. And -- but at the same time, see if the theatrical market can sort of kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films. But we're going to do what's best for our shareholders ultimately. And we don't announce our films that far in advance like we used to because we know that we're in time of flux and change still. And while COVID will be in the rearview mirror, god willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent. And so we're reading that on a weekly basis and make our decisions going forward accordingly."

Just to make something very clear the Disney+ Hotstar is included in our overall Disney+ guidance that we reiterate to be profitable in 2024. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that. But as it relates to ARPU specifically, there's been a lot of noise in the Indian market, a lot of which has been around sports. So when you look at the ARPU for Hot Star, on a linked quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 this year. It actually decreased that was a result of lower per sub advertising revenue because there were fewer IPL matches this year. In Q4, there were only 18, and I believe the number was 29-ish in Q3. You had a linked quarter reduction in games, therefore, lower subscriber advertising revenue. And when we think about ARPU overall, there's several levers here. There's the price value relationship over time, high-quality content. And the content in India is really 2 things. It's not only the IPL but other key sports like beyond cricket. So you have things like the English Premier League and Pro, Kabadi, And also, there's a big general entertainment component. We have all of our Disney content over there from all the different labels that we have, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and so on. but they also have over 18,000 hours of original local programming that is produced every year. So once again, I think the upside potential is when all things are working, all cylinders are working, and we'll be able to take price up as the market allows."

As you can probably suspect in a world to direct-to-consumer, we have a lot of information, a lot of data. And we have a pretty good idea of what the marginal impact of a particular title might be to our services. And we always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn but new titles, new content, whether they're movies or series actually add new subs. And that is actually the reason why we're pretty confident that the increase in content flow towards the second half of fiscal '22 will actually lead to the types of results that we're anticipating. And so we've got some pretty good data that suggests that, that is the case, given our history. While we only have 2 years, that 2 years has represented a number of titles, and you can start to build models, as I'm sure you can understand every time that we have a title, we have a pretty good idea of what the net impact of that is going to be both from a retention and to an addition standpoint. So we're pretty confident that once we get to more of a normal content flow in the second half of the year that some of the vacuum that we've had over the last couple of months will not be the case. Christine, do you want to handle the -- oh, there was also a question about cohorts widening. I'll handle that one as well. 
The -- it is true that Disney+ is a 4-quadrant service. And as such, we need content that's going to be broad in order to appeal to each of those demographics. If there's an opportunity that we're working on right now, it's sort of our preschool area. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to sort of assert ourselves in the direct-to-consumer way, the same way we did in the linear networks with Disney Channel. So that would be the biggest opportunity. And I can tell you that in sitting through our creative reviews, the new content that we've got, the new storytelling that we've got in the area of preschool is absolutely extraordinary. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of sort of Disney in that area in terms of content that's really going to become the cultural site guys and then drive our subs amongst that particular cohort of potential sub ads Disney+. But it is true that being a 4-quadrant service, we need to be broad in our approach. And that's why we fired up the engines, the production engines of our Fox teams that we've gotten in acquisitions, Fox Searchlight and just our general Disney General and our team, a team making content both for Hulu and for Disney+ as well as our services internationally.

Michael, I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that I just mentioned, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content that because of just the competition for talent, for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up  where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contract renegotiations and our commitment to paying our park workers well. And then we have things on the cost of goods side. And it's interesting. Just last week, maybe it was just last week, I was talking to our parks senior team about things we could do there. And there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers, we can substitute products. We can cut portion size, which is probably good for some people's waste lines. We can look at pricing where necessary. But we aren't going to go straight across and increase prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way. As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. But it's a great question, and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single company in your coverage universe."

It's driven by the consumer, particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience. It's not necessarily a lean back. It's a little bit of a lean forward type experience that they're looking for. And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in a bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this. 
We have done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only the ESPN brand, but the Disney brand in terms of consumers' changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling. And what we're finding is that there is a very significant installation gambling does not have the cache now that it had, say, 10 or 20 years ago. And we have some concerns as a company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal. But I can tell you that given all the research that we've done recently that, that is not the case. It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a bedding component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand. therefore, to go after that demographic opportunity plus the, of course, not insignificant revenue implications.

And the 2 that I would just call out are autos and technology, and those are for obvious reasons, that we all know about the chip shortage. 
On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu. And we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe, also has some real strategic advantages in this space. We've got a great slate of premium content, and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising that advertisers really desire. And we also have a purpose-built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu. And it's automating the sales process with programmatic and advertiser self-service channels. that we think are really going to continue to show good growth.

As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it has been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company, as we've made great strides in reopening our business while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. 
Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22, we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original and enduring stories; second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories; and lastly, using the power of our far-reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible. 
I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: direct-to-consumer, sports, and parks, experiences and products. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services, Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continued to perform incredibly well with 118.1 million, 17.1 million and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48% and Disney+ subs, in particular, by 60%. 
I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long term, not quarter-to-quarter, and we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year. 
This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day, a global company-wide celebration.  We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. 
Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure Jungle Cruise, and hilarious new short from The Simpsons, and the first 5 episodes of Season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, The World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. 
On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24, and the latest Star Wars adventure, The Book of Boba Fett on December 29. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of The Beatles: Get Back, Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel's Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week, and Disney's Encanto, which premiers in theaters on November 24, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. 
In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September. This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our Investor Conference 2.0. 
We recognize that the single, most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content, and we are singularly focused on making new high-quality entertainment including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340-plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 billion and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. 
We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world. The service is now available throughout Japan, and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea and Taiwan, and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we are now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50-plus additional countries, including in Central Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. 
Turning to sports. We continue to build out ESPN+ with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact,  all 7 of the major deals we made in the last 1.5 years included a streaming component. Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night wild card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL. 75 of the league's live national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers because live sports are a key element and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. 
The 90% of the most watched telecasts last year were sports and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record with an increase of 54% over the 2019, 2020 season opening doubleheader. And we are particularly pleased with the NHL's direct-to-consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay per views coming in the past year. 
At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcasts like the hugely popular Monday night football with Peyton and Eli, which airs on ESPN2 and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the Arena: Tom Brady, the multipart docu series about the legendary quarterback premiering on ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcasts. 
We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reach and scale, we have the potential to partner with third parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports and all of this, the rights deals, our innovative programming and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. 
One of the things that sets The Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our parks around the world open to guests, albeit, with some limits on capacity and the return of our entire Disney Cruise Line. 
At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5- to 11-year olds and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our parks were closed to reengineer and reimagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney day. 
In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with legacy annual passholders, while also attracting new passholders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new passholders. And most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers: Dream Key and Believe Key, with Dream Key selling out in just 2 months. We're also seeing a great response to the new annual passholder program at Walt Disney World, a testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. 
Walt Disney World rolled out its new multitiered full service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time waiting in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon. 
Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves.  We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at Epcot, which has quickly become one of the park's top attractions; our new themed restaurant, Space 220; and 2 new nighttime spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming months, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Starcruiser experience. 
As part of this immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience. 
Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish, in June of 2022, and we'll welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment driven by a premium price point well above the industry average. 
Before leaving our parks and experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our consumer products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, ShopDisney, and on more compelling retail partnerships such as Disney Store Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year. 
In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before with our new offerings, and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way only Disney can. Our company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of emerging technology and insights gained through our enumerable consumer touch points is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. 
The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience, Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon with synchronized sound, our groundbreaking development and use of audio animatronics. We were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005. Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation. These are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. 
As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences and global reach, we see limitless potential and that makes us as excited as ever about The Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain item",2081,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $2.29 or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. 
As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pretax income of approximately $200 million primarily at the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. 
I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with Parks, Experiences and Products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. A profitable fourth quarter at Parks and Experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. 
In the prior year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 4 weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double digits versus Q3 and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. 
Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend with per caps in the fourth quarter, up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019. Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we are looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. 
At our Cruise Line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to sea with guest ratings as strong as prepandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing. And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sale in June 2022 with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. 
At consumer products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles: Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. 
Turning to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year driven by lower results at Linear Networks, direct to consumer and content sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at Linear Networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million driven by a decrease at in our domestic channels partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. 
At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ABC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. 
At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors: one, lower affiliate revenue primarily driven by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week; two, an increase in marketing costs from more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter; and finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19-related timing impacts from the prior year. 
Costs decreased from the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year partially offset by increased costs for college football games. Domestic Linear Networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year driven by our cable networks and owned television stations, both of which were impacted by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week. 
ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year as higher rates were offset by the prior year benefit of the 53rd week. First quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7-point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. 
International channel results increased versus the prior year driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At direct to consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu.  
At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in subscription and premier access revenue. Higher subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing, and the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher premier access revenue was driven by Black Widow and Jungle Cruise in Q4 compared to Mulan in the prior year quarter. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3, in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, grew by almost 4 million from Q3 to Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of our total Disney+ paid subscriber base as of the end of the fourth quarter. Disney+'s global ARPU in the fourth quarter was $4.12. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 versus third quarter, continuing to benefit from recent price increases. 
At ESPN+, where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth and higher advertising revenue partially offset by increases in programming and, to a lesser extent, marketing costs. 
Google ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers inclusive of the Hulu + Live digital MVPD service. Hulu + Live subscribers increased to $4 million from $3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. 
Moving on to content sales, licensing and other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million driven by lower theatrical and TV SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. While theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases. Lower TV SVOD results were due to lower third-party content licensing of film content driven by the ongoing impact of COVID as well as our strategic shift towards distribution on our DTC services partially offset by higher income from sales of episodic content due to lower write-offs versus the prior year. 
To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. 
For fiscal '22, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021 driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish as well as other increased spending at DPEP and corporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed prepandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus prepandemic levels, including, for example: inflationary pressure on wages; costs related to new projects and initiatives such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus and the Epcot expansion; and a ramp up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion. 
And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are a few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we are seeing in the theatrical market paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter, which had only 2 releases. 
At Linear Networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year, reflecting factors including: higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL; timing of cricket expenses at Star India; and an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue. 
Finally, as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year, but we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases.  The fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have tentpole content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. 
Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo, all in 1 quarter. This includes highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Andor and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year. 
As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together, and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022, we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect that Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021 as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. 
As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectation that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions."

One of them is the Disney+ net adds. The other is probably more recently on parks margins. And you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks, but maybe you could just spend a minute really on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net adds being higher in '23 and '24 than in '22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot. 
And then on the parks front, Bob, you've talked a lot about parks margins when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before. But obviously, there's also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So maybe you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue, so we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this sort of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic."

But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter-to-quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered not necessarily by the content, but by the number of adds that we have in terms of markets. Our number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160 by FY '23, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. 
Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint. Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch and the hunger for content for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic and you have to shut down production that's not a good combination. And yet, we identified the need for the content way back exactly a year ago. and have prepared a very strong cadence of content, which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. 
In terms of the Park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think it was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen. There was a reference -- and I'm not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest per day. And that is a very, very material increase for us in per caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney+ business, both in terms of reiterance of guidance that has been given today. But additionally, in terms of where our parks business is going to go from a demand standpoint once we completely clear the pandemic, but also in terms of the -- what we expect to be long-lasting benefits in terms of yields. Christine?"

I'm glad you asked the question on parks expenses. And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that may be newer to following Disney.

And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that may be newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the parks expenses are in 3 buckets: fixed, which is quite substantial, semi fixed and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other, fixed and semi-fixed buckets, are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. 
What you see this fourth quarter is an overall margin for the global business for DPEP a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre-COVID levels. I've said this before, and I'll say it again that I believe that we will get, not only back to, but have a high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing. We're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield with demand giving capacity on any given day or week during the year. And on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements, not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. And those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who've been to our parks since we reopened, really enjoy that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels. Lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual queues for selected attractions. And we're, once again, really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guest movements throughout the park. 
So while these margins will remain impacted, while we're still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe, over the long term, that these fundamental changes are going to -- are going to result in higher margins overall. So thanks for asking that question. And the other thing I would say, as Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie, we have launched in Walt Disney World. We have not yet launched it in Disneyland. And I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland, people who come to visit Disneyland, the response will be as strong, if not stronger. Thanks."

As you know, we have reached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. And the extent to which we had a number of titles released going to theatrical will",370,"Okay. As you know, we have reached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. And the extent to which we had a number of titles released going to theatrical will eventually go to Disney+. But what we're seeing is some recovery of the theatrical exhibition marketplace, which is a good thing, by the way, for not only Disney, but also for the industry. And because most of the franchises that we've had as a Walt Disney company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution. 
At the same time, we're watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back, and we're watching very carefully our family films as they're released over the next couple of months to make sure that, that market will come back to theatrical exhibition as the general entertainment, let's say, the films that appeal to a younger target audience have come back. And so we're sticking with our plan of flexibility because we're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical first window. 
I should say that you'll notice that the films that we are putting into the marketplace in theatrical that are family films have a fairly short window at least in terms of any reference point to what history might have been. And we're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+. And -- but at the same time, see if the theatrical market can sort of kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films. But we're going to do what's best for our shareholders ultimately. And we don't announce our films that far in advance like we used to because we know that we're in a time of flux and change still. And while COVID will be in the rearview mirror, God willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent. And so we're reading that on a weekly basis and make our decisions going forward accordingly."

Just to make something very clear, the Disney+ Hotstar is included in our overall Disney+ guidance that we reiterate to be profitable in 2024. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that. But as it relates to ARPU specifically, there's been a lot of noise in the Indian market, a lot of which has been around sports. So when you look at the ARPU for Hotstar, on a linked quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 this year, it actually decreased and that was a result of lower per sub advertising revenue because there were fewer IPL matches this year. In Q4, there were only 18, and I believe the number was 29-ish in Q3. So you had a linked quarter reduction in games, therefore, lower subscriber advertising revenue. 
And when we think about ARPU overall, there's several levers here. There's the price value relationship over time, high-quality content. And the content in India is really 2 things. It's not only the IPL but other key sports like -- beyond cricket. So you have things like the English Premier League and Pro Kabaddi. And also, there's a big general entertainment component. We have all of our Disney content over there from all the different labels that we have, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and so on. But they also have over 18,000 hours of original local programming that is produced every year. 
So once again, I think the upside potential is when all things are working, all cylinders are working, and we'll be able to take price up as the market allows."

As you can probably suspect in a world to direct to consumer, we have a lot of information, a lot of data. And we have a pretty good idea of what the marginal impact of a particular title might be to our service. And we always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn, but new titles, new content, whether they're movies or series, actually add new subs. And that is actually the reason why we're pretty confident that the increase in content flow towards the second half of fiscal '22 will actually lead to the types of results that we're anticipating. 
And so we've got some pretty good data that suggests that, that is the case, given our history. While we only have 2 years, that 2 years has represented a number of titles, and you can start to build models. As I'm sure you can understand, every time that we have a title, we have a pretty good idea of what the net impact of that is going to be both from a retention and to an addition standpoint. So we're pretty confident that, once we get to more of a normal content flow in the second half of the year, that some of the vacuum that we've had over the last couple of months will not be the case. Christine, do you want to handle the -- oh and sorry, there was also a question about cohorts widening. I'll handle that one as well. 
The -- it is true that Disney+ is a 4-quadrant service. And as such, we need content that's going to be broad in order to appeal to each of those demographics. If there's an opportunity that we're working on right now, it's sort of our preschool area. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to sort of assert ourselves in the direct-to-consumer way, the same way we did in the Linear Networks with Disney Channel. So that would be the biggest opportunity. And I can tell you that, in sitting through our creative reviews, the new content that we've got, the new storytelling that we've got in the area of preschool is absolutely extraordinary. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of sort of Disney in that area in terms of content that's really going to become the cultural site guys and then drive our subs amongst that particular cohort of potential sub ads for Disney+. 
But it is true that being a 4-quadrant service, we need to be broad in our approach. And that's why we fired up the engines, the production engines of our Fox teams that we've gotten in acquisitions, Fox Searchlight and just our general -- Disney general entertainment team, making content both for Hulu and for Disney+ as well as our services internationally.

Michael, I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that -- I'll just mention, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. 
So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content that, because of just the competition for talent, for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up. Where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contract renegotiations and our commitment to paying our park workers well. And then we have things on the cost of goods side. And it's interesting. Just last week, maybe it was -- yes, just last week, I was talking to our parks senior team about things we could do there. And there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers. We can substitute products. We can cut portion size, which is probably good for some people's waste lines. We can look at pricing where necessary. 
But we aren't going to go just straight across and increase prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way. As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. But it's a great question, and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single company in your coverage universe."

Jessica, you're right, we do believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the company. And it's all driven by the consumer. It's driven by the consumer, particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience. It's not necessarily a lean back. It's a little bit of a lean forward-type experience that they're looking for. And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this. 
We have done substantial research in terms of the impact to, not only the ESPN brand, but the Disney brand in terms of consumers' changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling. And what we're finding is that there is a very significant installation. Gambling does not have the cache now that it had, say, 10 or 20 years ago. And we have some concerns as a company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal. But I can tell you that given all the research that we've done recently that, that is not the case. It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand. Therefore, to go after that demographic opportunity plus the, of course, not insignificant revenue implications, that is something that we're keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively."

And the 2 that I would just call out are autos and technology, and those are for obvious reasons, that we all know about the chip shortage. 
On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu. And we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe, also has some real strategic advantages in this space. We've got a great slate of premium content, and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising that advertisers really desire. And we also have a purpose built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu. And it's automating the sales process with programmatic and advertiser self-service channels that we think are really going to continue to show good growth. So we expect advertising to continue to be an important driver of Hulu revenues going forward. Thanks."

It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year",1856,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery while also fueling long-term growth.  
Our strategic focus continues in 3 key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new, high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition as consumers begin to return to theaters, and I'll talk more about the specifics later.  
Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government-mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies and other offerings.  
We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland 2 weeks ago, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street U.S.A. on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our casts' and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. 
It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed casts and retrain them to be able to operate to the state of California's new health and safety requirements.  
We continue to see strong, growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney, and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols.  
At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long fifth anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY '19 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. 
Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all-new Avengers campus which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit it recently, and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. 
We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish, to the public with a virtual livestream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing, and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first-ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022, and bookings open to the general public on May 27. 
On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios, consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms.  
We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for Best Actress, Best Director, with Chloe Zhao, becoming the first woman of color to win the award, and Best Picture. That's 5 Best Picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy, and we have outlined 3 approaches for distributing our films: releases in theaters with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access, releases straight to Disney+, and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. 
Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theaters and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28; followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively on Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9. And Disney's Jungle Cruise, a hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. 
I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in moviegoing, 2 films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. 
Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian, followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof.  
The second season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, the all-new The Mysterious Benedict Society, based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work, are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few.  
We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment, and we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+ which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.  
Looking at our entire portfolio of streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resume and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output would help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter.  
On Hulu, buzzworthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, The United States vs. Billie Holiday and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu Original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K, season 2 of the hit series Love, Victor, and season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu.  
In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu, and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+ are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight championship fight airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15; the final match of the FA Cup also on May 15; followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC match-up between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10, not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. 
Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even amidst the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivaled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business given the important economic value it drives for the company, we are also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering. And with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. 
With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals; others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga and the NHL. For example, as part of the 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the league's live national games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games, further cementing the service as a must-have for hockey fans.
And today, I'm excited to announce 2 additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball, with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday Night Baseball games and Opening Night annually; coverage of the highly anticipated, potential expanded Wild Card series; and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+.  
We've also signed historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish Club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal covering both English and Spanish language rights brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga 2 matches per season to ESPN+ beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. 
When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible.  We believe in the power of live sports and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. 
I'll walk through our results by segment, starting with Media & Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher results across all of the segment's lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 
ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cable's growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP bowl game, the National Championship, compared to 4 in the prior year quarter, 3 CFP bowl games and the National Championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. 
At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter-to-date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At Broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. 
At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards, partially offset by higher rates. 
On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our owned stations would negatively impact Broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall Broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series in addition to a number of other smaller factors. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. 
Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our Networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but -- or in the second quarter this year due to COVID-related timing shifts. 
Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu and ESPN+. 
The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1 which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. 
At ESPN+, improved year-over-year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our annual meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March, so we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA, and a domestic price increase toward the end of the quarter. 
We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate, the launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately 1/3 of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1, and there were no games in Q2. 
The current IPL tournament began on April 9 in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. 
Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+, and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales/licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. 
Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. 
Moving on to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at Consumer Products was more than offset by lower results at parks and experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to increases at our merchandise and games licensing businesses. At parks and experiences, results were again adversely affected by COVID-19-related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. 
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. 
Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. 
At Walt Disney World, attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double digits versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward-looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. 
Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, the Masters, Wimbledon and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year, during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. 
At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star+, our stand-alone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America, on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga and the Premier League; championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition; along with grand slam tennis. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year given the COVID-related suspension of the IPL season and our decision to move the Star+ Latin America launch to the fourth quarter, we remain very optimistic about our future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, and we look at it actually weekly.

I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World. And we really don't have the impact of Disneyland yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks, and that's flowing through the park's cash numbers. And we're also seeing good, strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those 2 elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. 
And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year because of some of the shifts in sports rights, expense timing from last year to this year, but we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year.

So on the first one, in terms of the drivers, for sub growth going forward, we really see 4 different elements. First of all is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. 
The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand, and we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for our international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing Malaysia today, as June 1 and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. 
But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S. be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the 4 components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of '24. 
In terms of the parks and when we're going to sort of be able to raise  our capacity limits. We've actually already started that given the guidance that just came today from the CDC and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those -- obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us, particularly if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on. That could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. 
So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that we're able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that."

It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as they had thought. But the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside, and it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising."

So now with capacity increasing, how does that relate to like kind of normal attendance? Even though you don't have international visitors, it still feels like, from what we can see, that it's fairly full, and you said demand is strong. I just wonder if you can comment on that. 
And also, any update you can give us, given the strong demand, how that overlays with some of the things you've talked about in the past that didn't really discuss today, but the yield management, some of the cost changes you've put in place. And then sorry for such a long-winded question, but given the tight labor market, are there any issues that you're seeing there either on the cost side or in hiring? 
And then finally, on DTC. I mean the slower net add in the second half sounds like it's coming from India, which, of course, is understandable given IPL as well as COVID. But there's also likely to be an impact on ARPU, a positive impact on ARPU. And I'm just wondering, how does that all translate into the operating results OI?"

So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guest response to that. So as capacity limits increase, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity. That is not something that keeps any of us up at night. 
In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while, and it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating at. But you've seen the margin's very healthy. Our yield is growing up from a very healthy standpoint. Consumers are spending more. And we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters because everything has become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand. We've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. 
And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously, one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get more and more cast members back. It thrills us to be able to do that, but we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests."

That is, in fact, the case. And it is largely due to the COVID-related suspension of the IPL and also that decision that we made to move the Star+ Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. 
The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India if that plays out like we just said. 
But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S. as well as EMEA for Disney+. So our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S. at the end of March, and we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters."

The first, you started touching on it a bit with the last series of questions. But I think one of the core thesis is that coming out of the pandemic, the potential that the parks at Disney are more profitable than pre-pandemic. And you talked about some of those drivers. One of them perhaps when the parks return to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? 
So one, I'm just curious if you agree with that thesis that the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic that it was going in. 
And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious, under what circumstances will you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Monday Night Football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+?"

In terms of park and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program, an affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know, the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure or a particular guest came in. 
With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high-demand day or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple of quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs in terms of making sure, again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time, get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. 
In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals, and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned, and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of the Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the leagues understand that, and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well."

Our longer-term vision is to parallel path both ESPN and ESPN+. But if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we negotiated in to go to these direct-to-consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN+ in terms of the direct-to-consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that."

And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for, and we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far, and we'll take that same approach going forward. 
In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports books, links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We see this as an opportunity. We know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follows sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully. But we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area."

And I can understand during COVID when it was very unlikely that people would be in theaters, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like it's going to be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us some insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. 
And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window?"

If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. 
In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor are consumers ready to go back in the theaters. Of course, 90%, let's say, of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. 
But if you look at last weekend's box office, for an example, and you compare versus an average of the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically, and 63% below -- or 67% below internationally. So we know the market's not quite there yet. 
So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for it, is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to re-prime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theater, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. 
In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theaters. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace, and we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."

It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year",1856,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery while also fueling long-term growth.  
Our strategic focus continues in 3 key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new, high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition as consumers begin to return to theaters, and I'll talk more about the specifics later.  
Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government-mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies and other offerings.  
We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland 2 weeks ago, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street U.S.A. on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our casts' and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. 
It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed casts and retrain them to be able to operate to the state of California's new health and safety requirements.  
We continue to see strong, growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney, and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols.  
At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long fifth anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY '19 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. 
Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all-new Avengers campus which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit it recently, and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. 
We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish, to the public with a virtual livestream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing, and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first-ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022, and bookings open to the general public on May 27. 
On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios, consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms.  
We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for Best Actress, Best Director, with Chloe Zhao, becoming the first woman of color to win the award, and Best Picture. That's 5 Best Picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy, and we have outlined 3 approaches for distributing our films: releases in theaters with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access, releases straight to Disney+, and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. 
Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theaters and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28; followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively on Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9. And Disney's Jungle Cruise, a hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. 
I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in moviegoing, 2 films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. 
Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian, followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof.  
The second season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, the all-new The Mysterious Benedict Society, based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work, are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few.  
We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment, and we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+ which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.  
Looking at our entire portfolio of streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resume and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output would help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter.  
On Hulu, buzzworthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, The United States vs. Billie Holiday and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu Original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K, season 2 of the hit series Love, Victor, and season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu.  
In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu, and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+ are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight championship fight airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15; the final match of the FA Cup also on May 15; followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC match-up between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10, not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. 
Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even amidst the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivaled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business given the important economic value it drives for the company, we are also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering. And with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. 
With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals; others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga and the NHL. For example, as part of the 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the league's live national games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games, further cementing the service as a must-have for hockey fans.
And today, I'm excited to announce 2 additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball, with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday Night Baseball games and Opening Night annually; coverage of the highly anticipated, potential expanded Wild Card series; and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+.  
We've also signed historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish Club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal covering both English and Spanish language rights brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga 2 matches per season to ESPN+ beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. 
When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible.  We believe in the power of live sports and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. 
I'll walk through our results by segment, starting with Media & Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher results across all of the segment's lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 
ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cable's growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP bowl game, the National Championship, compared to 4 in the prior year quarter, 3 CFP bowl games and the National Championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. 
At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter-to-date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At Broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. 
At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards, partially offset by higher rates. 
On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our owned stations would negatively impact Broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall Broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series in addition to a number of other smaller factors. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. 
Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our Networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but -- or in the second quarter this year due to COVID-related timing shifts. 
Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu and ESPN+. 
The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1 which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. 
At ESPN+, improved year-over-year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our annual meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March, so we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA, and a domestic price increase toward the end of the quarter. 
We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate, the launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately 1/3 of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1, and there were no games in Q2. 
The current IPL tournament began on April 9 in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. 
Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+, and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales/licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. 
Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. 
Moving on to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at Consumer Products was more than offset by lower results at parks and experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to increases at our merchandise and games licensing businesses. At parks and experiences, results were again adversely affected by COVID-19-related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. 
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. 
Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. 
At Walt Disney World, attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double digits versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward-looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. 
Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, the Masters, Wimbledon and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year, during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. 
At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star+, our stand-alone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America, on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga and the Premier League; championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition; along with grand slam tennis. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year given the COVID-related suspension of the IPL season and our decision to move the Star+ Latin America launch to the fourth quarter, we remain very optimistic about our future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World. And we really don't have the impact of Disneyland yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks, and that's flowing through the park's cash numbers. And we're also seeing good, strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those 2 elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. 
And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year because of some of the shifts in sports rights, expense timing from last year to this year, but we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year.

So on the first one, in terms of the drivers, for sub growth going forward, we really see 4 different elements. First of all is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. 
The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand, and we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for our international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing Malaysia today, as June 1 and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. 
But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S. be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the 4 components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of '24. 
In terms of the parks and when we're going to sort of be able to raise  our capacity limits. We've actually already started that given the guidance that just came today from the CDC and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those -- obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us, particularly if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on. That could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. 
So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that we're able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that."

Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in some of the more mature or, I guess, developed markets on the gross addition side? 
And then you guys have consistently beat us on OI profits or lack of losses, I'd say, on DTC. Which of the platforms is providing the biggest surprise?

In terms of the additions, we've really seen it across our geographies. When you look at it from a mature versus new.

But in terms of the mature, keep in mind that we added 30 million households in the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which is in line with our expectations. And domestic continues to contribute to that. The addition of the Marvel content, and not only the Marvel content, but how strong it's been, and the cadence of additions. And as you know, we'll soon be announcing -- or soon be launching Loki, that is a tremendous catalyst for growth for us. And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement. Because as you know, engagement is sort of the precursor for net sub adds. And so we're very pleased with both our domestic as well as our, let's call it, more mature markets, those that we've been in the marketplace for at least a year, but also our new markets as well."

Look, the biggest drivers for direct-to-consumer were coming out of Hulu and Disney+. They're a little bit different. Disney+, we saw some lower content costs. And that was due to some lower allocated costs for some of our own titles compared to what we had expected. And at Hulu, there was also some lower content costs, but for different reasons. It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as they had thought. But the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside, and it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising."

So now with capacity increasing, how does that relate to like kind of normal attendance? Even though you don't have international visitors, it still feels like, from what we can see, that it's fairly full, and you said demand is strong. I just wonder if you can comment on that. 
And also, any update you can give us, given the strong demand, how that overlays with some of the things you've talked about in the past that didn't really discuss today, but the yield management, some of the cost changes you've put in place. And then sorry for such a long-winded question, but given the tight labor market, are there any issues that you're seeing there either on the cost side or in hiring? 
And then finally, on DTC. I mean the slower net add in the second half sounds like it's coming from India, which, of course, is understandable given IPL as well as COVID. But there's also likely to be an impact on ARPU, a positive impact on ARPU. And I'm just wondering, how does that all translate into the operating results OI?"

So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guest response to that. So as capacity limits increase, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity. That is not something that keeps any of us up at night. 
In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while, and it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating at. But you've seen the margin's very healthy. Our yield is growing up from a very healthy standpoint. Consumers are spending more. And we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters because everything has become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand. We've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. 
And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously, one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get more and more cast members back. It thrills us to be able to do that, but we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests."

And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. 
The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India if that plays out like we just said. 
But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S. as well as EMEA for Disney+. So our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S. at the end of March, and we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters."

One of them perhaps when the parks return to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? 
So one, I'm just curious if you agree with that thesis that the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic that it was going in. 
And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious, under what circumstances will you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Monday Night Football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+?"

In terms of park and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program, an affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know, the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure or a particular guest came in. 
With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high-demand day or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple of quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs in terms of making sure, again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time, get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. 
In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals, and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned, and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of the Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the leagues understand that, and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well."

And I can understand during COVID when it was very unlikely that people would be in theaters, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like it's going to be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us some insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. 
And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window?"

But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. 
In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor are consumers ready to go back in the theaters. Of course, 90%, let's say, of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. 
But if you look at last weekend's box office, for an example, and you compare versus an average of the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically, and 63% below -- or 67% below internationally. So we know the market's not quite there yet. 
So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for it, is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to re-prime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theater, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. 
In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theaters. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace, and we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."

It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year",1856,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS up 32% to $0.79 compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery while also fueling long-term growth.  
Our strategic focus continues in 3 key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new, high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition as consumers begin to return to theaters, and I'll talk more about the specifics later.  
Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government-mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies and other offerings.  
We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland 2 weeks ago, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street U.S.A. on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our casts' and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. 
It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed casts and retrain them to be able to operate to the state of California's new health and safety requirements.  
We continue to see strong, growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney, and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols.  
At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long fifth anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY '19 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. 
Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all-new Avengers campus which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit it recently, and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. 
We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish, to the public with a virtual livestream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing, and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first-ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022, and bookings open to the general public on May 27. 
On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios, consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms.  
We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for Best Actress, Best Director, with Chloe Zhao, becoming the first woman of color to win the award, and Best Picture. That's 5 Best Picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy, and we have outlined 3 approaches for distributing our films: releases in theaters with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access, releases straight to Disney+, and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. 
Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theaters and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28; followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively on Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9. And Disney's Jungle Cruise, a hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theaters and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. 
I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in moviegoing, 2 films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. 
Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian, followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof.  
The second season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, the all-new The Mysterious Benedict Society, based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work, are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few.  
We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment, and we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+ which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.  
Looking at our entire portfolio of streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resume and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output would help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter.  
On Hulu, buzzworthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, The United States vs. Billie Holiday and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu Original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K, season 2 of the hit series Love, Victor, and season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu.  
In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu, and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+ are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight championship fight airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15; the final match of the FA Cup also on May 15; followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC match-up between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10, not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. 
Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even amidst the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivaled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business given the important economic value it drives for the company, we are also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering. And with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. 
With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals; others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga and the NHL. For example, as part of the 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the league's live national games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games, further cementing the service as a must-have for hockey fans.
And today, I'm excited to announce 2 additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball, with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday Night Baseball games and Opening Night annually; coverage of the highly anticipated, potential expanded Wild Card series; and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+.  
We've also signed historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish Club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal covering both English and Spanish language rights brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga 2 matches per season to ESPN+ beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. 
When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible.  We believe in the power of live sports and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter."

Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. 
I'll walk through our results by segment, starting with Media & Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher results across all of the segment's lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 
ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cable's growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP bowl game, the National Championship, compared to 4 in the prior year quarter, 3 CFP bowl games and the National Championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. 
At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter-to-date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At Broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. 
At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards, partially offset by higher rates. 
On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our owned stations would negatively impact Broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall Broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series in addition to a number of other smaller factors. 
Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. 
Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our Networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but -- or in the second quarter this year due to COVID-related timing shifts. 
Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu and ESPN+. 
The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1 which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. 
At ESPN+, improved year-over-year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our annual meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March, so we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA, and a domestic price increase toward the end of the quarter. 
We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate, the launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately 1/3 of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1, and there were no games in Q2. 
The current IPL tournament began on April 9 in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. 
Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+, and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales/licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. 
Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. 
Moving on to our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at Consumer Products was more than offset by lower results at parks and experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. 
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to increases at our merchandise and games licensing businesses. At parks and experiences, results were again adversely affected by COVID-19-related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. 
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. 
Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. 
At Walt Disney World, attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double digits versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward-looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. 
Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, the Masters, Wimbledon and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year, during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. 
At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star+, our stand-alone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America, on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga and the Premier League; championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition; along with grand slam tennis. 
As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year given the COVID-related suspension of the IPL season and our decision to move the Star+ Latin America launch to the fourth quarter, we remain very optimistic about our future. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, and we look at it actually weekly.

I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World. And we really don't have the impact of Disneyland yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks, and that's flowing through the park's cash numbers. And we're also seeing good, strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those 2 elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for.

Is it around eventually moving more into Eastern Europe or other markets in Asia? I guess, what do you guys see as sort of the main drivers for sub growth? 
And then just a follow-up, if I can, on the Parks. Any color you can provide on how we should think or how you're thinking about when it's okay to start raising capacity, attendance capacity, particularly at Disney World."

So on the first one, in terms of the drivers, for sub growth going forward, we really see 4 different elements. First of all is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. 
The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand, and we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for our international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing Malaysia today, as June 1 and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. 
But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S. be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the 4 components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of '24. 
In terms of the parks and when we're going to sort of be able to raise  our capacity limits. We've actually already started that given the guidance that just came today from the CDC and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those -- obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us, particularly if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on. That could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. 
So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that we're able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that."

But in terms of the mature, keep in mind that we added 30 million households in the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which is in line with our expectations. And domestic continues to contribute to that. The addition of the Marvel content, and not only the Marvel content, but how strong it's been, and the cadence of additions. And as you know, we'll soon be announcing -- or soon be launching Loki, that is a tremendous catalyst for growth for us. And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement. Because as you know, engagement is sort of the precursor for net sub adds. And so we're very pleased with both our domestic as well as our, let's call it, more mature markets, those that we've been in the marketplace for at least a year, but also our new markets as well."

Look, the biggest drivers for direct-to-consumer were coming out of Hulu and Disney+. They're a little bit different. Disney+, we saw some lower content costs. And that was due to some lower allocated costs for some of our own titles compared to what we had expected. And at Hulu, there was also some lower content costs, but for different reasons. It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as they had thought. But the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside, and it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising."

So now with capacity increasing, how does that relate to like kind of normal attendance? Even though you don't have international visitors, it still feels like, from what we can see, that it's fairly full, and you said demand is strong. I just wonder if you can comment on that. 
And also, any update you can give us, given the strong demand, how that overlays with some of the things you've talked about in the past that didn't really discuss today, but the yield management, some of the cost changes you've put in place. And then sorry for such a long-winded question, but given the tight labor market, are there any issues that you're seeing there either on the cost side or in hiring? 
And then finally, on DTC. I mean the slower net add in the second half sounds like it's coming from India, which, of course, is understandable given IPL as well as COVID. But there's also likely to be an impact on ARPU, a positive impact on ARPU. And I'm just wondering, how does that all translate into the operating results OI?"

So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guest response to that. So as capacity limits increase, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity. That is not something that keeps any of us up at night. 
In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while, and it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating at. But you've seen the margin's very healthy. Our yield is growing up from a very healthy standpoint. Consumers are spending more. And we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters because everything has become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand. We've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. 
And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously, one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get more and more cast members back. It thrills us to be able to do that, but we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests."

That is, in fact, the case. And it is largely due to the COVID-related suspension of the IPL and also that decision that we made to move the Star+ Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. 
The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India if that plays out like we just said. 
But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S. as well as EMEA for Disney+. So our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S. at the end of March, and we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters."

One of them perhaps when the parks return to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? 
So one, I'm just curious if you agree with that thesis that the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic that it was going in. 
And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious, under what circumstances will you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Monday Night Football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+?"

In terms of park and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program, an affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know, the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure or a particular guest came in. 
With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high-demand day or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple of quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs in terms of making sure, again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time, get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. 
In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals, and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned, and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of the Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the leagues understand that, and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well."

As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follows sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully. But we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area."

And one of those methods is a simultaneous release in the theaters and Premier Access. 
And I can understand during COVID when it was very unlikely that people would be in theaters, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like it's going to be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us some insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. 
And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window?"

If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. 
In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor are consumers ready to go back in the theaters. Of course, 90%, let's say, of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. 
But if you look at last weekend's box office, for an example, and you compare versus an average of the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically, and 63% below -- or 67% below internationally. So we know the market's not quite there yet. 
So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for it, is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to re-prime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theater, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. 
In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theaters. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace, and we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition."
