I plan to give an overview of the fourth quarter Howmet performance, Tolga will then speak to segment information, and Ken will provide further financial detail. 
I will return to talk to the outlook for the 2021 financial year. 
So please move to Slide #4. And first, let me provide some qualitative commentary regarding the fourth quarter before moving on to specific numbers. The fourth quarter played out as expected and guided. In fact, the results were above both consensus and the improved outlook that we provided in November. Revenues rose compared to the third quarter due to the lesser impact of commercial aerospace inventory corrections. Performance improved again and the decremental margin year-over-year was 24%, which was an improvement from the decremental margin in the third quarter, which was 37%. The incremental margin on the revenues benefited from the utilization of labor that we held onto in the third quarter in order to meet the expected increase in fourth quarter revenues, which were 9% as approximately forecast. 
Furthermore, the third quarter included the $8 million write-down of a long-term contracts that we bought out. 
Moving to specific numbers. Revenues improved over the third quarter by 9% and were 29% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reductions in commercial aerospace. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 22.8% and ahead of outlook. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin in 2020 was, in fact, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, while mitigating the market reductions and commercial aerospace adverse mix. Performance was driven by permanent cost reductions and price increases. And lastly, the fourth quarter earnings per share was 21%, again, ahead of consensus and at the top end of our outlook range. 
Moving to cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was positive at $268 million, which is the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow since separation. As you know, we define free cash flow very conservatively as the net cash after everything, i.e., after pension after AR securitization, paydown, et cetera. 
Q2 through the Q4 free cash flow was $487 million and above the outlook. The 478 -- $487 million includes an $80 million reduction in accounts receivable securitization. A $70 million of cash flow to pay down in incremental voluntary pension contributions. $47 million of severance costs, and we did receive a $45 million tax refund. Without these onetime items, free cash flow would indeed have been $638 million. Full year cash -- free cash flow as a percentage of net income was 115%, well above our guide of approximately 90%, and would have been approximately 160%, excluding the onetime items mentioned. 
Year-end cash balance was also ahead of outlook at $1.6 billion after repurchasing $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 
Now let me turn it over to Tolga to highlight segment performance."

So let's move to Slide #5, please. [indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter.

[indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter. Our operations secured continuously and customer demand with no major events. Our segments remain focused on the cost containment and cash preservation targets in the fourth quarter. Structural cost reductions exceeded the outlook. Effective variable costs to the extent and furloughs continued in specific locations to manage the sales fluctuations in different segments. Cash management actions continue with Class B. Strict capital expenditure control, strong accounts receivable collections and effective inventory management with the key customers stranded inventory discussions in the background contributed to Howmet's fourth quarter cash performance. 
Let's move to slide, please, please. I will start with engine products. Commercial aerospace revenue showed quarterly improvement, with the third quarter seasonal shutdown impacts not repeating and inventory adjustments slowing in line with our expectations. Defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in the fourth quarter. Effective variable cost flexing and driving permanent cost-outs ahead of the plan, have contributed to our incremental margins from the engine side in the fourth quarter. We are expecting the strengthen inventory discussion with our key customers to continue. Fastening Systems Industrial business continued to grow, balancing the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in our last earnings release that the Fastening business is the highest number of locations and permanent cost reductions gained traction across these locations in fourth quarter. We continue to bridge the timing of pending reductions with targeted furloughs and successful variable cost flexing, improving our operating margins with relatively flat revenue in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. The Engineered Structures segment revenue showed a small increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter, while we continue level loading our operations for an optimized operating model for long lead time orders. We are ahead of our cost-out plans as we implemented additional headcount reductions to get ready for the latest announcements in the 787 build rates. Costa plants are running ahead of plan and contributed to incremental margins also on the Structural segment. Commercial vehicle market recovery in the fourth quarter led to a record quarterly profit margin for the build segment. While the build markets continue to recover, increasing our low-cost country content, keeping permanent costs compressed and increasing the share of our revolutionary 39 pounds wheels, led to very healthy incremental margins in the fourth quarter. 
Let me now turn it over to Ken to provide more details on the financials."

For additional details on the fourth quarter, let's start with revenue. As expected, revenue was down 29% year-over-year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace and a 10% reduction in commercial transportation. These markets were partially offset by continued growth in defense, aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. On a sequential basis, although commercial aerospace grew 5%, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in commercial aerospace in the first quarter of 2021 due to lingering customer inventory corrections. Regarding the defense aerospace, commercial transportation and IGT markets, they all had double-digit sequential growth. Operating income, excluding special items was down 28% year-over-year, with commercial aerospace representing 40% of total revenue compared to 60% in 2019. Permanent cost reductions and price increases continued in the quarter. Permanent cost reductions were $60 million in the quarter and $197 million for the year, which were ahead of our outlook. Price increases were $11 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year, which were in line with our expectations. Decremental and margins improved to 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.21, which was ahead of consensus and at the top end of the outlook range. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. John covered the full year and post separation numbers, which were ahead of the outlook. I would add that in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with $1.6 billion of cash after repurchasing an additional $22 million of common stock in the quarter at an average price of $23.99. The remaining common stock repurchase authority from the Board of Directors is $277 million. 
Lastly, net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.2x and our revolving credit facility of $1 billion remains undrawn. Please move to Slide 8. Slide 8 is a summary of EBITDA margin performance. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin of 22.8% was ahead of the outlook and at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a 29% revenue decline in an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. The improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by price increases, variable cost selection and permanent cost reductions. 
Now let's move to Slide 9. Before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I would point out that the fourth quarter revenue was in line with the outlook at $1.238 billion, while profit was more than 10% or $27 million better than the outlook. 
Now for more detail on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue performance. Revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. As previously mentioned, commercial aerospace was down 51% year-over-year, which showed a 5% sequential increase. Our second largest market, defense aerospace continued to show growth and was up 24% in the quarter and 10% sequentially driven by demand for the joint strike fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to see favorable trends for increased demand in this market improved 15% sequentially. 
Finally, industrial and other markets, which is comprised of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat, but up 12% sequentially. IGT, which makes up 45% of this market continues to be strong, and was up 38% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. 
Moving to Slide 10. We'll quickly cover full year revenue performance. For the full year, revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which was down 38%. Commercial aerospace represented approximately 50% of revenue, which was down from approximately 60% in 2019. Defense aerospace was strong throughout the year and was up 14%. Defense aerospace represents almost 20% of the total revenue. Commercial transportation was down 31% for the year, but showed a strong recovery trend in the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, the industrial and other markets was up 1%, with IGT up 28% as the IGT market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 for the segment results. As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was down 33% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 58%, driven by customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 30% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 38% increase in IGT as IGT benefits from continued favorable natural gas prices. Decremental margins for engines improved to 18% for the quarter compared to 34% in the third quarter. 
In the appendix of the presentation, we provided a schedule that shows how all of the segment's decremental margins improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. 
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 12. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 38%, and commercial transportation was down 21%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems improved to 45% for the quarter compared to 58% in the third quarter. 
Now let's move to engineered structures on Slide 13. Engineered structures year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 52%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for both the 787 and 737 MAX platforms.  Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 40% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for engineered structures improved 24% for the quarter compared to 27% in the third quarter. 
Lastly, let's please move to Slide 14 for Forged Wheels. Forth Wheels revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but increased 18% sequentially as expected. Despite the lower revenues, the wheel segment's operating profit was higher than last year, and operating profit margin was at a record high of 30%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost reductions. Moreover, with the reduced volumes, we're able to shift production temporarily to low-cost countries, including Hungary and Mexico, which improved our margins. 
Lastly, we've been increasing market share with a new innovative 39-pound wheel. 
Now let's move to Slide 15 for special items. Special items for the quarter were a benefit of approximately $14 million after tax, primarily due to insurance proceeds received for fires at 2 of our plants. Additionally, a favorable outcome of a Spanish tax assessment primarily offset our severance cost. I'd like to comment and provide further perspective on how much post separation special items. For the past 2 years, we've undertook a major restructuring and performance improvement program, including the separation of Arconic Corporation. Post separation, the after-tax charges of the 2020 were approximately $100 million driven by 2 items: first, a voluntary U.K. pension settlement charge of $55 million in the second quarter, which reduced our gross pension liability by $320 million; and then second, in April, we paid down and refinanced our debt and an after-tax cost of $50 million. The refinancing added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet and refinanced a portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds to a maturity in May of 2025. Regarding the balance, the other special items, they've pretty much all netted out. So now let's move to the capital structure and liquidity on Slide 16. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is October 2024. Gross debt at the end of 2020 was $1.5 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Strong cash generation in the year has reduced our net debt by approximately $370 million since separation. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, we decreased our U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. A few additional items of note. 
First, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization by $100 million in 2020. This reduction in AR sold was effectively a repayment of debt, which increases working capital and reduced our 2020 adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned. 
Lastly, on January 15, 2021, we used cash on hand to complete the redemption at par of our 2021 bonds that were due in April. By paying down the bonds 3 months early, had no additional cost. We saved $5 million of interest costs. On an annual basis, interest costs are reduced by approximately $19 million. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Revenues is in line with the outlook, while profit and margin exceeded. Our differentiated products and ability to scale resulted in price increases in line with expectations. Permanent cost reductions continued and accelerated throughout the year, which also exceeded our outlook. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 22.8% exceeded the outlook and was at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite some 29% less revenue and an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. 
Regarding liquidity, adjusted free cash flow and cash balance exceeded our outlook. Full year accounts receivable securitization was reduced by $100 million and voluntary pension contributions were made of $70 million. While severance costs $51 million were incurred, albeit we had tax refunds of some $78 million. Full year CapEx was favorable to the outlook at 3% of revenue. The $155 million spent was over $100 million less than the depreciation of $269 million. Adjusted free cash flow was ahead of outlook at $487 million for the second through fourth quarters, and $387 million for the full year. Net debt was reduced by $370 million since separation. Additionally, the gross pension liability was reduced by some $320 million. Cash increased to $1.6 billion, a $100 million beat to guide after the repurchasing of $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 2020 was another year of heavy lifting. After separation, we refinanced the balance sheet phased into the COVID pandemic and the impact on our operations and sales demand and further improved balance sheet. 
Now let's move on to Slide 18. First, let me comment on the 2021 outlook qualitatively. Our end markets of defense, aerospace, commercial transportation and industrial gas turbines continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility and reflects our view regarding the global vaccine rollout, its acceptance and potential impact on travel. Airline travel should improve, especially for shortfall routes, which may help dissipate narrow-body inventories, especially for Boeing. We expect to improved clarity on these factors as we move through 2021. 
Regarding commercial aerospace, we expect increased aircraft build, especially as we move forward into 2022 and beyond. This will help both inventory clearance and shift to an inventory build situation, which will help rebuild the pipeline of aircraft parts. 
Now let's move to the specific numbers. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. For EBITDA, we provided you with a baseline figure with a range of minus $5 million to plus $15 million, so between $245 million and $265 million. Our EBITDA margin is ranged from 20.8% to 21.3%. And earnings per share is at [ $1.16 ] -- $0.16 baseline with a range of $0.15 to $0.19. In Q1 2021, we expect commercial aerospace to be down a little from Q4 due to lingering inventory corrections. Please note that for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter average was $1.208 million, and the baseline guide is in line with the average of the last 3 quarters. For the year, we expect revenues of $5.1 billion at baseline with a range of $5.05 billion to $525 billion, in other words, minus $50 plus $150. EBITDA baseline of $1.1 billion with a range of $1.07 billion to $1.15 billion, again, minus $32 plus $150 -- plus $50. 
EBITDA margin, 21.6% for the year with a range of 21.2% to 21.9%. Earnings per share baseline at $0.80 with a range of $0.75 to $0.89. And free cash flow at $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. Let me provide you with a few assumptions. The cost restructuring carryover into 2021 will be $100 million. Price increases are expected to be above the 2020 increases. Pension/OPEB cash contributions are expected to be about $160 million compared to last year's $236 million. The operational tax rate is in the range 26.5% to 28.5%, similar to the average rate for 2020 at 27.5%. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be 115%, again above our long-term outlook of 90%. The cash tax rate will increase to about 15%. And CapEx, we've put in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Maybe a couple of further comments to put 2021 into perspective. You can see by the revenue guide of $1.2 billion for the first quarter versus $5.1 billion for the year at baseline, but there is an expectation that quarterly revenue begins to accelerate during the year. Margins are respectable and above 2020 year. [indiscernible] our baseline versus the normal outlook award we use, we have a smaller, lower bandwidth to the downside and a higher bandwidth of the upside. 
That concludes my commentary before we move to question and answer. Thank you."

And I mean, I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1",821,"Let me have a go at that Gautam. And I mean, I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1,200 with a bandwidth around it plus or minus 50. So our view is that Q1 is essentially the same as the average of the last 3 quarters. With my feeling or I'd say, statement is that Q2, we were not seeing much by way of customer inventory reductions, although we had the impact of certain customer plants being closed as we went into April last year. And then significant inventory corrections in the third quarter, in particular, and a lower correction in the first quarter. Right now, it just feels as though things are pretty opaque. And essentially, the rollout of the vaccine, the airline load factors. In fact, if anything, airline load factors have reduced substantially in Europe with the almost closing down of travel in certain countries, particularly into the U.K. and an international air travel has actually become, if anything, a little bit more problematical rather than improving. And so right now, there's little to observe and celebrate. And then you look at the rollout of the vaccine, in particular, and that feels also below that, which we could have or maybe should have expected. And indeed, some of the process to actually get that into people's arms has also been, I'll say, underwhelming. And I can talk from personal experience, having got my first chart a couple of weeks ago, and just the whole process even trying to register and get the vaccine, never mind, is it going to be available for the second shot. So that whole rollout has been, let's say, underwhelming. And so when you think about travel at the moment and therefore, what's the impact on build, it's -- there's little to the upside and celebrate. And so we just say first quarter is roughly in line with the average of about 3 quarters. That's best we can see. I mean it's a bandwidth of variability around it. So it could be, as we put what we call baseline rather than outlook, to try to say this is what we think is like that what you can rely upon with a relatively small downside and with a relatively higher upside. So we've given you an asymmetrical picture compared to what we normally do of just giving you a midpoint and a plus or minus around it. And we did that at EBITDA margin in the first quarter. And then for the year, we also gave you an asymmetrical picture, calling 1 baseline and then a lesser reduction and a higher upside. And it really is -- it's the degree of opaqueness regarding the future demand. I mean we've had the courage again to provide not just guidance for the quarter, but guidance for the year. And I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves ahead of our skis at the moment and say, do we really have the absolute foresight to see the full year? And I think any reasonable person would say, it's difficult when there's so many factors that you don't yet understand. I mean, while commercial transportation feels pretty solid. The defense and industrial markets for us, still pretty solid. The oil and gas market is looking better, with the improvement in oil prices and natural gas is still sort of being the prevalent fossil fuel used in power stations. All of that's to the good. And then there's the commercial aerospace. And commercial aero, while we did see a lower inventory takeout in the fourth quarter, you're still 51% down year-on-year. And at the moment, we don't yet have the courage to say it's going to get significantly better either in the first quarter or in the first half of this year. I mean the bright news on the horizon appears to be that airbus have indicated an increasing build rate for the A320, which is great, and that will map up inventory, we think, in the course of the year and maybe give us a build situation. Whereas on the 737, we haven't had any significant news one way or the other. And on 787, it's a little bit reduced from what we thought. So again, taking in the context of it's a baseline, it's a view. And we're hoping that the view for the incremental revenues. We do see that as we move through the year. And that's why I commented $1.2 billion for the first quarter, let's say, 5.1 with that asymmetrical bundle with around that. Should give us, hopefully, I'll say, a higher run rate into the back half of the year. Does that cover it out, Gautam?"

With the others, I'm going to call it roughly in line. I recognize I didn't really talk much to the margin question. You answered, let me cover that out as well. So in my thoughts around the first quarter is -- we've guided in that, I think, give or take, 21% or possibly even a higher numbers over '21. Conceivably, because I feel stronger about the margin than I do, the revenue side, you could be at the full end of that. But why do I think, first of all, it's higher than 2020, so I think that's good to say that we are confident that our first quarter is going to be at a run rate higher than 2020.

And put that, you can assume that's within the bandwidth of the whole of the uncertainty around the commercial aerospace market at the moment, which we choose to be cautious about. Because we just don't feel as that we know enough and don't feel on solid ground enough at this point in time. While we hope for better, we're just planning to be in the zone where we feel confident at this point. So hopefully that covers out the margin side of it as well for you."

And therefore, the margin, there is still some to come in the first half of 2021. We also have also been adjusting our manufacturing footprint, which, again, to the benefits and chosen to invest some more monies into Hungary for our wheels business. And that basically will come on stream during the fourth quarter of '21, all leading to, I think, healthy towards the run rate as we exit the year. But really leading us to '22. So my previous commentaries that we've seen, as you know, '22 to be at similar levels to 2019 and then '23 above, all of that still holds. And at the moment, you've seen what I think shows a really strong incremental margin in the fourth quarter. So as volume has come back into one of our divisions, then that incremental margin was tremendous. I'll hesitate to give you the number because it just sounds so good. I mean, you can give it later if he needs to. But basically, I'll call, fabulous incremental margin on that, which if we -- if everything works out as planned, we hope to replicate that in our commercial aerospace businesses when we begin to see some volume recovery. And that's -- while we feel confident we're going to see recovery in the future. It's still a matter of what will it be and when."

We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let's say, 32 to 38 -- sorry, 32 the 35 build sets we guesstimate. It's always difficult, both when you're at the both first year and through second-tier levels in the supply chain. And as you know, through our engine products business, we operate through both GE Aviation and also probability for the 2 engine variants for the A320. My expectation is that destocking will -- I'm going to take a swag at this now. We think that will have completely dried up by the end of the second quarter. And we're going to have to start building some products ahead, particularly as it goes to the 45% rate in the fourth quarter this year. So that's what I call the -- when we all won bright spots, and we've got 2 commercial transportation in this Airbus lift, and that gives us -- it brings a little bit of a smile to our face. On the other hand, for Boeing at the moment, the -- they -- state, they've been building at 7 per month in the back end of 2020. And whereas we know we've been supplying less than half of that rate. So small numbers. And we just expect that to continue certainly through the first half of this year. And then when they raise it to, is it 10 and 20, and then hopefully, into the 30s by the second quarter of '22, then well before then, we'll have start matching the run rate of part shipments to the build rate of aircraft. Now the question is when does that occur? And the -- I don't have a lot of information regarding the clearance of the Boeing inventory at this point. I note the RyanAir order. I note that there were 27 deliveries of the 737 out of the 450 aircraft parked up in the fourth -- I think, in the fourth quarter, or by, which is great. But we know that given the fact that they built is aircraft in the fourth quarter. That just -- or just a little bit low the build rate, more than the build rate, sorry. So there's still a lot to go. And so once we see that inventory dissipating as the information begins to flow this year, I think we'll become increasingly confident in the Boeing stated build rates. Bear in mind to date, in actual terms, all we've seen is reductions sequentially for the last 18 months. And we obviously note the planned increases. But for us to feel confident, we've got to see that aircraft park dissipated. And those increase in build rates reconfirm to us. So we tend to be a little bit cautious at this point in time."

We've got a nice improvement there on the pension cash contributions and OPEB contributions on a year-over-year basis. As you know, as we exited 2020 as the discount rate didn't work favorably for us. It was about 80 bps unfavorable, that cost us around $200 million on the liability side. Asset returns were very strong for the business, over 14%. So that kind of netted out. But when you look at the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB program, especially over the last 12 months, we're going to see a favorability there. The other things I would look at the tax rate pretty much the same as what we've had before. You can see interest expense though that's most likely going to be as you do the walk around $290 million for the year. And the big question, David, and I know you're focused on it like we are, is the working capital, right? As we look at 2020, working capital was not a source or use of cash in 2020, right? We took down the AR securitization program, which was a $100 million burn in that number. So that's all embedded there. So it wasn't a source or use even when we consider the bring down to the AR securitization program. So as we move into 2021, we think, working capital, and this is all going to depend on, if John talked about the revenue ramp as we go to the second half of the year as well as some of the stranded inventory as we clear that out of the channel. I expect working capital to be a modest source of cash embedded in that $400 million guide that we gave you."

My thoughts there are is the trigger, I think, for us to be more aggressive in that regard would be seeing solidification of the on call, commercial aerospace build rate.

The trigger for that is all centered on. If the skylines [indiscernible] to a build, I feel confident in. I see those skylines begin to lift, particularly as we go in the back half into '22. I see inventory being put into the system because those builds are scheduled rather than just talked about. And the good news is that we're told that we're going to see those Airbus increases, actually scheduled in February. So we haven't seen them in the first 2 or 3 days. But we say, by the end of the month, we'll see those in production releases. And then when you see that, you get more of a confidence than just a new skyline number. Because, as you know, that skyline, even on the more confident Airbus side move from -- maybe it's going from 40 to 47 to, let's see 43 than a 45 before moving maybe to a 40, 18, 22. So I'd like to see it in schedule form rather than just News media form, and we need to just see what's widebody doing and then the clearance of the inventory for Boeing. And I think that's the point where I say, yes, we're good. We'll have a pretty good view of what our incremental margins will be as we see that demand increase and then it's off to the races, maybe in terms of any cash deployment for share buyback."

First of all, it's not a delicate topic. It's pretty straightforward, really. Pratt decided back in 2017 in the year after they'd sold their previous business in air oils to make selective reimbursement. They felt the need, first of all, to acquire some business to be able to provide more accurate coring for those castings because previously, they've never been able to achieve, I believe the yields, which are necessary to be cost-effective in that regard and have the -- obviously, the quality performance that comes out. The investment is exactly the same as previously stated, $650 million, as we think. It covers both the casting, coring, hole drilling, machining, coatings. So there's a lot of stuff in there. And our view is that the increase in spares demand in the -- let's call it in that '23, '25, '27 time frame, the spares demand is slated to grow very significantly, then all of that capacity could be used for that.

Having said all of that, we believe our defense sales will be solid and increasing in 2021. The F-35 be a more modest part of that in terms of OE bill, maybe slightly more in spares build, but nothing of great note at this point and we just see generally the military budget for '21, remains healthy.

And then as the volume started to come back was very surgical in terms of how we brought people back in. But the expansions that we have are going to help as we move forward. And the last thing I would mention is just the improved yields in that business as well. The production of the wheels business has improved over the last several years. So a real testament to that team. And I'll give you one data point from a quality perspective, PPMs in our wheels business is less than 10. So 1-0, right?

I will return to talk to the outlook for the 2021 financial year. 
So please move to Slide #4. And first, let me provide some qualitative commentary regarding the fourth quarter before moving on to specific numbers. The fourth quarter played out as expected and guided. In fact, the results were above both consensus and the improved outlook that we provided in November. Revenues rose compared to the third quarter due to the lesser impact of commercial aerospace inventory corrections. Performance improved again and the decremental margin year-over-year was 24%, which was an improvement from the decremental margin in the third quarter, which was 37%. The incremental margin on the revenues benefited from the utilization of labor that we held onto in the third quarter in order to meet the expected increase in fourth quarter revenues, which were 9% as approximately forecast. 
Furthermore, the third quarter included the $8 million write-down of a long-term contracts that we bought out. 
Moving to specific numbers. Revenues improved over the third quarter by 9% and were 29% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reductions in commercial aerospace. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 22.8% and ahead of outlook. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin in 2020 was, in fact, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, while mitigating the market reductions and commercial aerospace adverse mix. Performance was driven by permanent cost reductions and price increases. And lastly, the fourth quarter earnings per share was 21%, again, ahead of consensus and at the top end of our outlook range. 
Moving to cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was positive at $268 million, which is the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow since separation. As you know, we define free cash flow very conservatively as the net cash after everything, i.e., after pension after AR securitization, paydown, et cetera. 
Q2 through the Q4 free cash flow was $487 million and above the outlook. The 478 -- $487 million includes an $80 million reduction in accounts receivable securitization. A $70 million of cash flow to pay down in incremental voluntary pension contributions. $47 million of severance costs, and we did receive a $45 million tax refund. Without these onetime items, free cash flow would indeed have been $638 million. Full year cash -- free cash flow as a percentage of net income was 115%, well above our guide of approximately 90%, and would have been approximately 160%, excluding the onetime items mentioned. 
Year-end cash balance was also ahead of outlook at $1.6 billion after repurchasing $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 
Now let me turn it over to Tolga to highlight segment performance."
416264458,701065807,2189872,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. So let's move to Slide #5, please. [indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter.

[indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter. Our operations secured continuously and customer demand with no major events. Our segments remain focused on the cost containment and cash preservation targets in the fourth quarter. Structural cost reductions exceeded the outlook. Effective variable costs to the extent and furloughs continued in specific locations to manage the sales fluctuations in different segments. Cash management actions continue with Class B. Strict capital expenditure control, strong accounts receivable collections and effective inventory management with the key customers stranded inventory discussions in the background contributed to Howmet's fourth quarter cash performance. 
Let's move to slide, please, please. I will start with engine products. Commercial aerospace revenue showed quarterly improvement, with the third quarter seasonal shutdown impacts not repeating and inventory adjustments slowing in line with our expectations. Defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in the fourth quarter. Effective variable cost flexing and driving permanent cost-outs ahead of the plan, have contributed to our incremental margins from the engine side in the fourth quarter. We are expecting the strengthen inventory discussion with our key customers to continue. Fastening Systems Industrial business continued to grow, balancing the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in our last earnings release that the Fastening business is the highest number of locations and permanent cost reductions gained traction across these locations in fourth quarter. We continue to bridge the timing of pending reductions with targeted furloughs and successful variable cost flexing, improving our operating margins with relatively flat revenue in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. The Engineered Structures segment revenue showed a small increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter, while we continue level loading our operations for an optimized operating model for long lead time orders. We are ahead of our cost-out plans as we implemented additional headcount reductions to get ready for the latest announcements in the 787 build rates. Costa plants are running ahead of plan and contributed to incremental margins also on the Structural segment. Commercial vehicle market recovery in the fourth quarter led to a record quarterly profit margin for the build segment. While the build markets continue to recover, increasing our low-cost country content, keeping permanent costs compressed and increasing the share of our revolutionary 39 pounds wheels, led to very healthy incremental margins in the fourth quarter. 
Let me now turn it over to Ken to provide more details on the financials."

For additional details on the fourth quarter, let's start with revenue. As expected, revenue was down 29% year-over-year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace and a 10% reduction in commercial transportation. These markets were partially offset by continued growth in defense, aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. On a sequential basis, although commercial aerospace grew 5%, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in commercial aerospace in the first quarter of 2021 due to lingering customer inventory corrections. Regarding the defense aerospace, commercial transportation and IGT markets, they all had double-digit sequential growth. Operating income, excluding special items was down 28% year-over-year, with commercial aerospace representing 40% of total revenue compared to 60% in 2019. Permanent cost reductions and price increases continued in the quarter. Permanent cost reductions were $60 million in the quarter and $197 million for the year, which were ahead of our outlook. Price increases were $11 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year, which were in line with our expectations. Decremental and margins improved to 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.21, which was ahead of consensus and at the top end of the outlook range. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. John covered the full year and post separation numbers, which were ahead of the outlook. I would add that in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with $1.6 billion of cash after repurchasing an additional $22 million of common stock in the quarter at an average price of $23.99. The remaining common stock repurchase authority from the Board of Directors is $277 million. 
Lastly, net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.2x and our revolving credit facility of $1 billion remains undrawn. Please move to Slide 8. Slide 8 is a summary of EBITDA margin performance. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin of 22.8% was ahead of the outlook and at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a 29% revenue decline in an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. The improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by price increases, variable cost selection and permanent cost reductions. 
Now let's move to Slide 9. Before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I would point out that the fourth quarter revenue was in line with the outlook at $1.238 billion, while profit was more than 10% or $27 million better than the outlook. 
Now for more detail on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue performance. Revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. As previously mentioned, commercial aerospace was down 51% year-over-year, which showed a 5% sequential increase. Our second largest market, defense aerospace continued to show growth and was up 24% in the quarter and 10% sequentially driven by demand for the joint strike fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to see favorable trends for increased demand in this market improved 15% sequentially. 
Finally, industrial and other markets, which is comprised of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat, but up 12% sequentially. IGT, which makes up 45% of this market continues to be strong, and was up 38% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. 
Moving to Slide 10. We'll quickly cover full year revenue performance. For the full year, revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which was down 38%. Commercial aerospace represented approximately 50% of revenue, which was down from approximately 60% in 2019. Defense aerospace was strong throughout the year and was up 14%. Defense aerospace represents almost 20% of the total revenue. Commercial transportation was down 31% for the year, but showed a strong recovery trend in the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, the industrial and other markets was up 1%, with IGT up 28% as the IGT market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. 
Now let's move to Slide 11 for the segment results. As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was down 33% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 58%, driven by customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 30% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 38% increase in IGT as IGT benefits from continued favorable natural gas prices. Decremental margins for engines improved to 18% for the quarter compared to 34% in the third quarter. 
In the appendix of the presentation, we provided a schedule that shows how all of the segment's decremental margins improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. 
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 12. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 38%, and commercial transportation was down 21%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems improved to 45% for the quarter compared to 58% in the third quarter. 
Now let's move to engineered structures on Slide 13. Engineered structures year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 52%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for both the 787 and 737 MAX platforms.  Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 40% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for engineered structures improved 24% for the quarter compared to 27% in the third quarter. 
Lastly, let's please move to Slide 14 for Forged Wheels. Forth Wheels revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but increased 18% sequentially as expected. Despite the lower revenues, the wheel segment's operating profit was higher than last year, and operating profit margin was at a record high of 30%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost reductions. Moreover, with the reduced volumes, we're able to shift production temporarily to low-cost countries, including Hungary and Mexico, which improved our margins. 
Lastly, we've been increasing market share with a new innovative 39-pound wheel. 
Now let's move to Slide 15 for special items. Special items for the quarter were a benefit of approximately $14 million after tax, primarily due to insurance proceeds received for fires at 2 of our plants. Additionally, a favorable outcome of a Spanish tax assessment primarily offset our severance cost. I'd like to comment and provide further perspective on how much post separation special items. For the past 2 years, we've undertook a major restructuring and performance improvement program, including the separation of Arconic Corporation. Post separation, the after-tax charges of the 2020 were approximately $100 million driven by 2 items: first, a voluntary U.K. pension settlement charge of $55 million in the second quarter, which reduced our gross pension liability by $320 million; and then second, in April, we paid down and refinanced our debt and an after-tax cost of $50 million. The refinancing added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet and refinanced a portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds to a maturity in May of 2025. Regarding the balance, the other special items, they've pretty much all netted out. So now let's move to the capital structure and liquidity on Slide 16. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is October 2024. Gross debt at the end of 2020 was $1.5 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Strong cash generation in the year has reduced our net debt by approximately $370 million since separation. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, we decreased our U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. A few additional items of note. 
First, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization by $100 million in 2020. This reduction in AR sold was effectively a repayment of debt, which increases working capital and reduced our 2020 adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned. 
Lastly, on January 15, 2021, we used cash on hand to complete the redemption at par of our 2021 bonds that were due in April. By paying down the bonds 3 months early, had no additional cost. We saved $5 million of interest costs. On an annual basis, interest costs are reduced by approximately $19 million. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Revenues is in line with the outlook, while profit and margin exceeded. Our differentiated products and ability to scale resulted in price increases in line with expectations. Permanent cost reductions continued and accelerated throughout the year, which also exceeded our outlook. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 22.8% exceeded the outlook and was at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite some 29% less revenue and an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. 
Regarding liquidity, adjusted free cash flow and cash balance exceeded our outlook. Full year accounts receivable securitization was reduced by $100 million and voluntary pension contributions were made of $70 million. While severance costs $51 million were incurred, albeit we had tax refunds of some $78 million. Full year CapEx was favorable to the outlook at 3% of revenue. The $155 million spent was over $100 million less than the depreciation of $269 million. Adjusted free cash flow was ahead of outlook at $487 million for the second through fourth quarters, and $387 million for the full year. Net debt was reduced by $370 million since separation. Additionally, the gross pension liability was reduced by some $320 million. Cash increased to $1.6 billion, a $100 million beat to guide after the repurchasing of $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 2020 was another year of heavy lifting. After separation, we refinanced the balance sheet phased into the COVID pandemic and the impact on our operations and sales demand and further improved balance sheet. 
Now let's move on to Slide 18. First, let me comment on the 2021 outlook qualitatively. Our end markets of defense, aerospace, commercial transportation and industrial gas turbines continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility and reflects our view regarding the global vaccine rollout, its acceptance and potential impact on travel. Airline travel should improve, especially for shortfall routes, which may help dissipate narrow-body inventories, especially for Boeing. We expect to improved clarity on these factors as we move through 2021. 
Regarding commercial aerospace, we expect increased aircraft build, especially as we move forward into 2022 and beyond. This will help both inventory clearance and shift to an inventory build situation, which will help rebuild the pipeline of aircraft parts. 
Now let's move to the specific numbers. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. For EBITDA, we provided you with a baseline figure with a range of minus $5 million to plus $15 million, so between $245 million and $265 million. Our EBITDA margin is ranged from 20.8% to 21.3%. And earnings per share is at [ $1.16 ] -- $0.16 baseline with a range of $0.15 to $0.19. In Q1 2021, we expect commercial aerospace to be down a little from Q4 due to lingering inventory corrections. Please note that for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter average was $1.208 million, and the baseline guide is in line with the average of the last 3 quarters. For the year, we expect revenues of $5.1 billion at baseline with a range of $5.05 billion to $525 billion, in other words, minus $50 plus $150. EBITDA baseline of $1.1 billion with a range of $1.07 billion to $1.15 billion, again, minus $32 plus $150 -- plus $50. 
EBITDA margin, 21.6% for the year with a range of 21.2% to 21.9%. Earnings per share baseline at $0.80 with a range of $0.75 to $0.89. And free cash flow at $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. Let me provide you with a few assumptions. The cost restructuring carryover into 2021 will be $100 million. Price increases are expected to be above the 2020 increases. Pension/OPEB cash contributions are expected to be about $160 million compared to last year's $236 million. The operational tax rate is in the range 26.5% to 28.5%, similar to the average rate for 2020 at 27.5%. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be 115%, again above our long-term outlook of 90%. The cash tax rate will increase to about 15%. And CapEx, we've put in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Maybe a couple of further comments to put 2021 into perspective. You can see by the revenue guide of $1.2 billion for the first quarter versus $5.1 billion for the year at baseline, but there is an expectation that quarterly revenue begins to accelerate during the year. Margins are respectable and above 2020 year.

And I mean, I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1",821,"Let me have a go at that Gautam. And I mean, I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1,200 with a bandwidth around it plus or minus 50. So our view is that Q1 is essentially the same as the average of the last 3 quarters. With my feeling or I'd say, statement is that Q2, we were not seeing much by way of customer inventory reductions, although we had the impact of certain customer plants being closed as we went into April last year. And then significant inventory corrections in the third quarter, in particular, and a lower correction in the first quarter. Right now, it just feels as though things are pretty opaque. And essentially, the rollout of the vaccine, the airline load factors. In fact, if anything, airline load factors have reduced substantially in Europe with the almost closing down of travel in certain countries, particularly into the U.K. and an international air travel has actually become, if anything, a little bit more problematical rather than improving. And so right now, there's little to observe and celebrate. And then you look at the rollout of the vaccine, in particular, and that feels also below that, which we could have or maybe should have expected. And indeed, some of the process to actually get that into people's arms has also been, I'll say, underwhelming. And I can talk from personal experience, having got my first chart a couple of weeks ago, and just the whole process even trying to register and get the vaccine, never mind, is it going to be available for the second shot. So that whole rollout has been, let's say, underwhelming. And so when you think about travel at the moment and therefore, what's the impact on build, it's -- there's little to the upside and celebrate. And so we just say first quarter is roughly in line with the average of about 3 quarters. That's best we can see. I mean it's a bandwidth of variability around it. So it could be, as we put what we call baseline rather than outlook, to try to say this is what we think is like that what you can rely upon with a relatively small downside and with a relatively higher upside. So we've given you an asymmetrical picture compared to what we normally do of just giving you a midpoint and a plus or minus around it. And we did that at EBITDA margin in the first quarter. And then for the year, we also gave you an asymmetrical picture, calling 1 baseline and then a lesser reduction and a higher upside. And it really is -- it's the degree of opaqueness regarding the future demand. I mean we've had the courage again to provide not just guidance for the quarter, but guidance for the year. And I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves ahead of our skis at the moment and say, do we really have the absolute foresight to see the full year? And I think any reasonable person would say, it's difficult when there's so many factors that you don't yet understand. I mean, while commercial transportation feels pretty solid. The defense and industrial markets for us, still pretty solid. The oil and gas market is looking better, with the improvement in oil prices and natural gas is still sort of being the prevalent fossil fuel used in power stations. All of that's to the good. And then there's the commercial aerospace. And commercial aero, while we did see a lower inventory takeout in the fourth quarter, you're still 51% down year-on-year. And at the moment, we don't yet have the courage to say it's going to get significantly better either in the first quarter or in the first half of this year. I mean the bright news on the horizon appears to be that airbus have indicated an increasing build rate for the A320, which is great, and that will map up inventory, we think, in the course of the year and maybe give us a build situation. Whereas on the 737, we haven't had any significant news one way or the other. And on 787, it's a little bit reduced from what we thought. So again, taking in the context of it's a baseline, it's a view. And we're hoping that the view for the incremental revenues. We do see that as we move through the year. And that's why I commented $1.2 billion for the first quarter, let's say, 5.1 with that asymmetrical bundle with around that. Should give us, hopefully, I'll say, a higher run rate into the back half of the year. Does that cover it out, Gautam?"

With the others, I'm going to call it roughly in line. I recognize I didn't really talk much to the margin question. You answered, let me cover that out as well. So in my thoughts around the first quarter is -- we've guided in that, I think, give or take, 21% or possibly even a higher numbers over '21. Conceivably, because I feel stronger about the margin than I do, the revenue side, you could be at the full end of that. But why do I think, first of all, it's higher than 2020, so I think that's good to say that we are confident that our first quarter is going to be at a run rate higher than 2020. And I do recognize that at the moment, we do say -- we are saying that it's probably not quite as good as the fourth quarter. And put that, you can assume that's within the bandwidth of the whole of the uncertainty around the commercial aerospace market at the moment, which we choose to be cautious about. Because we just don't feel as that we know enough and don't feel on solid ground enough at this point in time. While we hope for better, we're just planning to be in the zone where we feel confident at this point. So hopefully that covers out the margin side of it as well for you."

And therefore, the margin, there is still some to come in the first half of 2021. We also have also been adjusting our manufacturing footprint, which, again, to the benefits and chosen to invest some more monies into Hungary for our wheels business. And that basically will come on stream during the fourth quarter of '21, all leading to, I think, healthy towards the run rate as we exit the year. But really leading us to '22. So my previous commentaries that we've seen, as you know, '22 to be at similar levels to 2019 and then '23 above, all of that still holds. And at the moment, you've seen what I think shows a really strong incremental margin in the fourth quarter. So as volume has come back into one of our divisions, then that incremental margin was tremendous. I'll hesitate to give you the number because it just sounds so good. I mean, you can give it later if he needs to. But basically, I'll call, fabulous incremental margin on that, which if we -- if everything works out as planned, we hope to replicate that in our commercial aerospace businesses when we begin to see some volume recovery. And that's -- while we feel confident we're going to see recovery in the future. It's still a matter of what will it be and when."

We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let's say, 32 to 38 -- sorry, 32 the 35 build sets we guesstimate. It's always difficult, both when you're at the both first year and through second-tier levels in the supply chain. And as you know, through our engine products business, we operate through both GE Aviation and also probability for the 2 engine variants for the A320. My expectation is that destocking will -- I'm going to take a swag at this now. We think that will have completely dried up by the end of the second quarter. And we're going to have to start building some products ahead, particularly as it goes to the 45% rate in the fourth quarter this year. So that's what I call the -- when we all won bright spots, and we've got 2 commercial transportation in this Airbus lift, and that gives us -- it brings a little bit of a smile to our face. On the other hand, for Boeing at the moment, the -- they -- state, they've been building at 7 per month in the back end of 2020. And whereas we know we've been supplying less than half of that rate. So small numbers. And we just expect that to continue certainly through the first half of this year. And then when they raise it to, is it 10 and 20, and then hopefully, into the 30s by the second quarter of '22, then well before then, we'll have start matching the run rate of part shipments to the build rate of aircraft. Now the question is when does that occur? And the -- I don't have a lot of information regarding the clearance of the Boeing inventory at this point. I note the RyanAir order. I note that there were 27 deliveries of the 737 out of the 450 aircraft parked up in the fourth -- I think, in the fourth quarter, or by, which is great. But we know that given the fact that they built is aircraft in the fourth quarter. That just -- or just a little bit low the build rate, more than the build rate, sorry. So there's still a lot to go. And so once we see that inventory dissipating as the information begins to flow this year, I think we'll become increasingly confident in the Boeing stated build rates. Bear in mind to date, in actual terms, all we've seen is reductions sequentially for the last 18 months. And we obviously note the planned increases. But for us to feel confident, we've got to see that aircraft park dissipated. And those increase in build rates reconfirm to us. So we tend to be a little bit cautious at this point in time."

We've got a nice improvement there on the pension cash contributions and OPEB contributions on a year-over-year basis. As you know, as we exited 2020 as the discount rate didn't work favorably for us. It was about 80 bps unfavorable, that cost us around $200 million on the liability side. Asset returns were very strong for the business, over 14%. So that kind of netted out. But when you look at the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB program, especially over the last 12 months, we're going to see a favorability there. The other things I would look at the tax rate pretty much the same as what we've had before. You can see interest expense though that's most likely going to be as you do the walk around $290 million for the year. And the big question, David, and I know you're focused on it like we are, is the working capital, right? As we look at 2020, working capital was not a source or use of cash in 2020, right? We took down the AR securitization program, which was a $100 million burn in that number. So that's all embedded there. So it wasn't a source or use even when we consider the bring down to the AR securitization program. So as we move into 2021, we think, working capital, and this is all going to depend on, if John talked about the revenue ramp as we go to the second half of the year as well as some of the stranded inventory as we clear that out of the channel. I expect working capital to be a modest source of cash embedded in that $400 million guide that we gave you."

My thoughts there are is the trigger, I think, for us to be more aggressive in that regard would be seeing solidification of the on call, commercial aerospace build rate.

The trigger for that is all centered on. If the skylines [indiscernible] to a build, I feel confident in. I see those skylines begin to lift, particularly as we go in the back half into '22. I see inventory being put into the system because those builds are scheduled rather than just talked about. And the good news is that we're told that we're going to see those Airbus increases, actually scheduled in February. So we haven't seen them in the first 2 or 3 days. But we say, by the end of the month, we'll see those in production releases. And then when you see that, you get more of a confidence than just a new skyline number. Because, as you know, that skyline, even on the more confident Airbus side move from -- maybe it's going from 40 to 47 to, let's see 43 than a 45 before moving maybe to a 40, 18, 22. So I'd like to see it in schedule form rather than just News media form, and we need to just see what's widebody doing and then the clearance of the inventory for Boeing. And I think that's the point where I say, yes, we're good. We'll have a pretty good view of what our incremental margins will be as we see that demand increase and then it's off to the races, maybe in terms of any cash deployment for share buyback."

So we've just assumed that, that just continues, and we're not seeing anything and not choosing to believe at the moment that there could be an increase just because what what's still out there, what could be cannibalized than moved off.

And we just assume that's the case for the next 2 quarters."

And if there's any more insight into what's happening there? And if that's going to be work that might share in your markets or if it's separate and separate content from what you do? First of all, it's not a delicate topic. It's pretty straightforward, really. Pratt decided back in 2017 in the year after they'd sold their previous business in air oils to make selective reimbursement. They felt the need, first of all, to acquire some business to be able to provide more accurate coring for those castings because previously, they've never been able to achieve, I believe the yields, which are necessary to be cost-effective in that regard and have the -- obviously, the quality performance that comes out. The investment is exactly the same as previously stated, $650 million, as we think. It covers both the casting, coring, hole drilling, machining, coatings. So there's a lot of stuff in there. And our view is that the increase in spares demand in the -- let's call it in that '23, '25, '27 time frame, the spares demand is slated to grow very significantly, then all of that capacity could be used for that. What we also note is that we have renewed our LTA with Pratt in this area. And so all is good. Nothing to comment further, really, no information that we've had."

So we do have a lot of significant defense business elsewhere. We supply GE with a lot of military FL applications and other structural casting applications that -- as well as Pratt & Whitney. So I just wanted to baseline that for you military budgets, even in the course of the year don't -- if I don't necessarily move all in a similar percentage is often a little bit of a hike towards the end of the year. Money is spent. Budgets are when they are still deplete with money. And so my thought is that maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit higher just because we have seen that in previous years as well. Having said all of that, we believe our defense sales will be solid and increasing in 2021. The F-35 be a more modest part of that in terms of OE bill, maybe slightly more in spares build, but nothing of great note at this point and we just see generally the military budget for '21, remains healthy. And it wouldn't surprise us, we see the similar cadence through the year of, again, slightly lower in the early part of the year and slightly higher in the second half of the year when any any budget moneys are spent."

And then as the volume started to come back was very surgical in terms of how we brought people back in. But the expansions that we have are going to help as we move forward. And the last thing I would mention is just the improved yields in that business as well. The production of the wheels business has improved over the last several years. So a real testament to that team. And I'll give you one data point from a quality perspective, PPMs in our wheels business is less than 10. So 1-0, right?

Following the same format as last quarter's earnings call, I plan to give an overview of the fourth quarter Howmet performance. Tolga will then speak to segment information, and Ken will provide further financial detail. I will return to talk to the outlook for the 2021 financial year.
So please move to Slide #4. And first, let me provide some qualitative commentary regarding the fourth quarter before moving on to specific numbers. The fourth quarter played out as expected and guided. In fact, the results were above both consensus and the improved outlook that we provided in November. Revenues rose compared to the third quarter due to the lesser impact of commercial aerospace inventory corrections. Performance improved again and the decremental margin year-over-year was 24%, which was an improvement from the decremental margin in the third quarter, which was 37%. The incremental margin on the revenues benefited from the utilization of labor that we held onto in the third quarter in order to meet the expected increase in fourth quarter revenues, which were 9% as approximately forecast. Furthermore, the third quarter included the $8 million write-down of our long-term contracts that we bought out. 
Moving to specific numbers. Revenues improved over the third quarter by 9% and were 29% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reductions in commercial aerospace. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 22.8% and ahead of outlook. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin in 2020 was, in fact, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, while mitigating the market reductions and commercial aerospace adverse mix. Performance was driven by permanent cost reductions and price increases. And lastly, the fourth quarter earnings per share was 21%, again, ahead of consensus and at the top end of our outlook range. 
Moving to cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was positive at $268 million, which is the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow since separation. As you know, we define free cash flow very conservatively as the net cash after everything, i.e., after pension, after AR securitization, paydown, et cetera. 
Q2 through the Q4 free cash flow was $487 million and above the outlook. The $478 million -- of $487 million, includes an $80 million reduction in accounts receivable securitization. A $70 million of cash flow to pay down in incremental voluntary pension contributions. $47 million of severance costs, and we did receive a $45 million tax refund. Without these onetime items, free cash flow would indeed have been $638 million. Full year cash -- free cash flow as a percentage of net income was 115%, well above our guide of approximately 90%, and would have been approximately 160%, excluding the onetime items mentioned. 
Year-end cash balance was also ahead of outlook at $1.6 billion after repurchasing $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98.
Now let me turn it over to Tolga to highlight segment performance."

So let's move to Slide #5, please. Safety of our people is a top priority as the COVID cases continued to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter.

Safety of our people is a top priority as the COVID cases continued to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter. Our operations secured continuously and customer demand with no major events. Our segments remain focused on the cost containment and cash preservation targets in the fourth quarter. Structural cost reductions exceeded the outlook. Effective variable costs to the extent and furloughs continued in specific locations to manage the sales fluctuations in different segments. Cash management actions continue with Class B. Strict capital expenditure control, strong accounts receivable collections and effective inventory management with the key customers stranded inventory discussions in the background contributed to Howmet's fourth quarter cash performance.
Let's move to slide, please, please. I will start with engine products. Commercial aerospace revenue showed quarterly improvement, with the third quarter seasonal shutdown impacts not repeating and inventory adjustments slowing in line with our expectations. Defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in the fourth quarter. Effective variable cost flexing and driving permanent cost-outs ahead of the plan have contributed to our incremental margins from the engine side in the fourth quarter. We are expecting the strengthen inventory discussion with our key customers to continue. Fastening Systems industrial business continued to grow, balancing the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in our last earnings release that the fasteners business has the highest number of locations and permanent cost reductions gained traction across these locations in fourth quarter.
We continue to bridge the timing of pending reductions with targeted furloughs and successful variable cost flexing, improving our operating margins with relative to flat revenue in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. The Engineered Structures segment revenue showed a small increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter, while we continue level loading our operations for an optimized operating model for long lead time orders. We are ahead of our cost-out plans. As we implemented additional headcounts reductions to get ready for the latest announcements in the 787 build rates.
Cost-out plans are running ahead of plan and contributed to incremental margins also on the structure side. Commercial vehicle market recovery in the fourth quarter led to a record quarterly profit margin for the build segment. While the build markets continue to recover, increasing our low-cost country content, keeping permanent costs compressed and increasing the share of our revolutionary 39 pounds wheels, led to very healthy incremental margins in the fourth quarter.
Let me now turn it over to Ken to provide more details on the financials."

For additional details on the fourth quarter, let's start with revenue. As expected, revenue was down 29% year-over-year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace and a 10% reduction in commercial transportation. These markets were partially offset by continued growth in defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets.
On a sequential basis, although commercial aerospace grew 5%, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in commercial aerospace in the first quarter of 2021 due to lingering customer inventory corrections. Regarding the defense aerospace, commercial transportation and IGT markets, they all had double-digit sequential growth. Operating income, excluding special items, was down 28% year-over-year, with commercial aerospace representing 40% of total revenue compared to 60% in 2019.
Permanent cost reductions and price increases continued in the quarter. Permanent cost reductions were $60 million in the quarter and $197 million for the year, which were ahead of our outlook. Price increases were $11 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year, which were in line with our expectations. Decremental and margins improved to 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.21, which was ahead of consensus and at the top end of the outlook range.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. John covered the full year and post-separation numbers, which were ahead of the outlook. I would add that in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with $1.6 billion of cash after repurchasing an additional $22 million of common stock in the quarter at an average price of $23.99. The remaining common stock repurchase authority from the Board of Directors is $277 million. Lastly, net debt to EBITDA was 3.2x, and our revolving credit facility of $1 billion remains undrawn.
Please move to Slide 8. Slide 8 is a summary of EBITDA margin performance. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin of 22.8% was ahead of the outlook and at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a 29% revenue decline in an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. The improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by price increases, variable cost selection and permanent cost reductions.
Now let's move to Slide 9. Before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I would point out that the fourth quarter revenue was in line with the outlook at $1.238 billion, while profit was more than 10% or $27 million better than the outlook. Now for more detail on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue performance. Revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter.
As previously mentioned, commercial aerospace was down 51% year-over-year, which showed a 5% sequential increase. Our second largest market, defense aerospace continued to show growth and was up 24% in the quarter and 10% sequentially driven by demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to see favorable trends for increased demand in this market improved 15% sequentially.
Finally, industrial and other markets, which is comprised of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was flat but up 12% sequentially. IGT, which makes up 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up 38% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.
Moving to Slide 10. We'll quickly cover full year revenue performance. For the full year, revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which was down 38%. Commercial aerospace represented approximately 50% of revenue, which was down from approximately 60% in 2019. Defense aerospace was strong throughout the year and was up 14%. Defense aerospace represents almost 20% of total revenue. Commercial transportation was down 31% for the year, but showed a strong recovery trend in the third and fourth quarters. Finally, the industrial and other markets was up 1%, with IGT up 28% as the IGT market rebounds from a weak level in 2019.
Now let's move to Slide 11 for the segment results. As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was down 33% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 58%, driven by customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 30% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 38% increase in IGT as IGT benefits from continued favorable natural gas prices. Decremental margins for engines improved to 18% for the quarter compared to 34% in the third quarter.
In the appendix of the presentation, we provided a schedule that shows how all of the segment's decremental margins improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 12. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 38%, and commercial transportation was down 21%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems improved to 45% for the quarter compared to 58% in the third quarter.
Now let's move to Engineered Structures on Slide 13. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 52% driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for both the 787 and 737 MAX platforms. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 40% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures improved 24% for the quarter compared to 27% in the third quarter.
Lastly, let's please move to Slide 14 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but increased 18% sequentially as expected. Despite the lower revenues, the wheel segment's operating profit was higher than last year, and operating profit margin was at a record high of 30%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost reductions. Moreover, with the reduced volumes, we're able to shift production temporarily to low-cost countries, including Hungary and Mexico, which improved our margins. Lastly, we've been increasing market share with a new innovative 39-pound wheel.
Now let's move to Slide 15 for special items. Special items for the quarter were a benefit of approximately $14 million after tax, primarily due to insurance proceeds received for fires at 2 of our plants. Additionally, a favorable outcome of a Spanish tax assessment primarily offset our severance cost.
I'd like to comment and provide further perspective on how much post-separation special items. For the past 2 years, we've undertook a major restructuring and performance improvement program, including the separation of Arconic Corporation. Post-separation, the after-tax charges in 2020 were approximately $100 million driven by 2 items: first, a voluntary U.K. pension settlement charge of $55 million in the second quarter, which reduced our gross pension liability by $320 million; and then second, in April, we paid down and refinanced our debt at an after-tax cost of $50 million.
The refinancing added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet and refinanced a portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds to a maturity in May of 2025. Regarding the balance, the other special items, they've pretty much all netted out.
So now let's move to the capital structure and liquidity on Slide 16. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is October 2024. Gross debt at the end of 2020 was $1.5 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Strong cash generation in the year has reduced our net debt by approximately $370 million since separation. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, we decreased our U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million.
A few additional items of note. First, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization by $100 million in 2020. This reduction in AR sold was effectively a repayment of debt, which increases working capital and reduced our 2020 adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned. Lastly, on January 15, 2021, we used cash on hand to complete the redemption at par of our 2021 bonds that were due in April. By paying down the bonds 3 months early at no additional cost, we saved $5 million of interest cost. On an annual basis, interest costs are reduced by approximately $19 million.
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Revenue is in line with the outlook, while profit and margin exceeded. Our differentiated products and ability to scale resulted in price increases in line with expectations. Permanent cost reductions continued and accelerated throughout the year, which also exceeded our outlook. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 22.8% exceeded the outlook and was at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite some 29% less revenue and an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix.
Regarding liquidity, adjusted free cash flow and cash balance exceeded our outlook. Full year accounts receivable securitization was reduced by $100 million and voluntary pension contributions were made of $70 million. While severance of costs $51 million were incurred, albeit we had tax refunds of some $78 million. Full year CapEx was favorable to the outlook at 3% of revenue. The $155 million spent was over $100 million less than the depreciation of $269 million.
Adjusted free cash flow was ahead of outlook at $487 million for the second through fourth quarters and $387 million for the full year. Net debt was reduced by $370 million since separation. Additionally, the gross pension liability was reduced by some $320 million. Cash increased to $1.6 billion, a $100 million beat to guide after the repurchasing of $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 2020 was another year of heavy lifting. After separation, we refinanced the balance sheet phased into the COVID pandemic and the impact on our operations and sales demand and further improved our balance sheet.
Now let's move on to Slide 18. First, let me comment on the 2021 outlook qualitatively. Our end markets of defense aerospace, commercial transportation and industrial gas turbines continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility and reflects our view regarding the global vaccine rollout, its acceptance and potential impact on travel. Airline travel should improve, especially for shortfall routes, which may help dissipate narrow-body inventories, especially for Boeing. We expect to improve clarity on these factors as we move through 2021.
Regarding commercial aerospace, we expect increased aircraft build, especially as we move forward into 2022 and beyond. This will help both inventory clearance and shift to an inventory build situation, which will help rebuild the pipeline of aircraft parts.
Now let's move to the specific numbers. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. For EBITDA, we provided you with a baseline figure with a range of minus $5 million to plus $15 million, so between $245 million and $265 million. Our EBITDA margin is ranged from 20.8% to 21.3%. And earnings per share is at $0.16 baseline with a range of $0.15 to $0.19.
In Q1 2021, we expect commercial aerospace to be down a little from Q4 due to lingering inventory corrections. Please note that for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter average was $1.208 million, and the baseline guide is in line with the average of the last 3 quarters. For the year, we expect revenues of $5.1 billion at baseline with a range of $5.05 billion to $525 billion, in other words, minus $50, plus $150. EBITDA baseline of $1.1 billion with a range of $1.07 billion to $1.15 billion, again, minus $32, plus $150 -- plus $50.
EBITDA margin, 21.6% for the year with a range of 21.2% to 21.9%. Earnings per share baseline at $0.80 with a range of $0.75 to $0.89, and free cash flow at $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. Let me provide you with a few assumptions. The cost restructuring carryover into 2021 will be $100 million. Price increases are expected to be above the 2020 increases. Pension/OPEB cash contributions are expected to be about $160 million compared to last year's $236 million. The operational tax rate is in the range 26.5% to 28.5%, similar to the average rate for 2020 at 27.5%. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be 115%, again above our long-term outlook of 90%. The cash tax rate will increase to about 15%. And CapEx, we've put in the range of $200 million to $220 million.
Maybe a couple of further comments to put 2021 into perspective. You can see by the revenue guide of $1.2 billion for the first quarter versus $5.1 billion for the year at baseline. There is an expectation that quarterly revenue begins to accelerate during the year. Margins are respectable and above 2020 year. And in our baseline versus the normal outlook word we use, we have a smaller, lower bandwidth to the downside and a higher bandwidth to the upside.
That concludes my commentary before we move to question and answer. Thank you."

And I mean I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were $1.250 billion, Q3 $1.130 billion, Q4 $1.240 billion, give or take, 1 million or so. And that averages at $1.208 billion. So what we",826,"Let me have a go at that, Gautam. And I mean I'll give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were $1.250 billion, Q3 $1.130 billion, Q4 $1.240 billion, give or take, 1 million or so. And that averages at $1.208 billion. So what we placed, what we call baseline, at $1,200 billion with a bandwidth around it plus or minus $50 million. So our view is that Q1 is essentially the same as the average of the last 3 quarters.
With my feeling or I'd say statement is that Q2, we were not seeing much by way of customer inventory reductions, although we had the impact of certain of our customer plants being closed as we went into April last year. And then significant inventory corrections in the third quarter, in particular, and a lower correction in the first quarter. Right now, it just feels as though things are pretty opaque. And essentially, the rollout of the vaccine, the airline load factors. In fact, if anything, airline load factors have reduced substantially in Europe with the almost closing down of travel in certain countries, particularly into the U.K. and an international air travel has actually become, if anything, a little bit more problematical rather than improving.
And so right now, there's little to observe and celebrate and then you look at the rollout of the vaccine, in particular, and that feels also below that, which we could have or maybe should have expected. And indeed, some of the process to actually get that into people's arms has also been, I'll say, underwhelming. And I can talk from personal experience, having gotten my first shot a couple of weeks ago, and just the whole process even trying to register and get the vaccine, never mind, is it going to be available for the second shot. So that whole rollout has been, let's say, underwhelming.
And so when you think about travel at the moment and therefore, what's the impact on build, it's -- there's little to the upside and celebrate. And so we just say first quarter is roughly in line with the average of about 3 quarters. That's the best we can see. I mean it's a bandwidth of variability around it. So it could be, as we put what we call baseline rather than outlook, to try to say this is what we think is like that what you can rely upon with a relatively small downside and with a relatively higher upside. So we've given you an asymmetrical picture compared to what we normally do of just giving you a midpoint and a plus or minus around it. And we did that at EBITDA margin in the first quarter. And then for the year, we also gave you an asymmetrical picture, calling 1 baseline and then a lesser reduction and a higher upside.
And it really is -- it's the degree of opaqueness regarding the future demand. I mean we've had the courage again to provide not just guidance for the quarter, but guidance for the year. And just don't want to get ahead of ourselves, ahead of our skis at the moment and say, do we really have the absolute foresight to see the full year? And I think any reasonable person would say, it's difficult when there's so many factors that you don't yet understand. I mean, while commercial transportation feels pretty solid. The defense and industrial markets for us still pretty solid. The oil and gas market is looking better, with the improvement in oil prices and natural gas is still sort of being the prevalent fossil fuel used in power stations. All of that's to the good.
And then there's the commercial aerospace. And commercial aero, while we did see a lower inventory takeout in the fourth quarter, you're still 51% down year-on-year. And at the moment, we don't yet have the courage to say it's going to get significantly better either in the first quarter or in the first half of this year. I mean the bright news on the horizon appears to be that Airbus have indicated an increasing build rate for the A320, which is great, and that will map up inventory, we think, in the course of the year and maybe give us a build situation.
Whereas on the 737, we haven't had any significant news one way or the other. And on 787, it's a little bit reduced from what we thought. So again, taking in the context of it's a baseline, it's a view. And we are hoping that the view for the incremental revenues, we do see that as we move through the year. And that's why I commented $1.2 billion for the first quarter, let's say, $5.1 billion with that asymmetrical bandwidth around that should give us, hopefully, I'll say, a higher run rate into the back half of the year. Does that cover it out, Gautam?"

I recognize I didn't really talk much to the margin question you answered, let me cover that out as well. So in my thoughts around the first quarter is -- we've guided in that, I think, give or take, 21% or possibly even higher numbers over '21. Conceivably, because I feel stronger about the margin than I do the revenue side, it could be at the full end of that.
But why do I think, first of all, it's higher than 2020, so I think that's good to say that we are confident that our first quarter is going to be at a run rate higher than 2020. And I do recognize that at the moment, we do say -- we are saying that it's probably not quite as good as the fourth quarter. And put that, you can assume that's within the bandwidth of the whole of the uncertainty around the commercial aerospace market at the moment, which we choose to be cautious about, because we just don't feel as that we know enough and don't feel on solid ground enough at this point in time. While we hope for better, we're just planning to be in the zone where we think we -- and we feel confident at this point. So hopefully that covers out the margin side of it as well for you."

There may be some, let's call it, let's say, required retraining just to make sure we're on top of our game because we treat both quality promises and our delivery promises as very serious. Despite all the, I'll say, pandemic disruption last year that both our quality indices and delivery indices were actually improved again. And we do want to maintain that track record. So we have assumed that there may be a little bit of drag from bringing people back earlier than immediately for the demand profile. And just to make sure that they're fully trained, fully ready to go.
Just the same as in our third quarter, we did hold on to some labor ready for the fourth quarter, and you saw that was good. And so again, it's just a planning assumption.

So in terms of utilization of that new plants because we've tend to try to use the new on, let's say, some of the old because of the efficiency we gain from it and therefore the margin. There is still some to come in the first half of 2021.
We also have -- also been adjusting our manufacturing footprint, which, again, to the benefits and chosen to invest some more monies into Hungary for our wheels business. And that basically will come on stream during the fourth quarter of '21, all leading to, I think, healthy towards the run rate as we exit the year, but really leading us to '22.
So my previous commentaries that we've seen, as you know, '22 to be at similar levels to 2019 and then '23 above, all of that still holds. And at the moment, you've seen what I think shows a really strong incremental margin in the fourth quarter. So as volume has come back into one of our divisions, then that incremental margin was tremendous. I'll hesitate to give you the number because it just sounds so good. I mean you can give it later if it needs to. But basically, I'll call, fabulous incremental margin on that, which if we -- if everything works out as planned, we hope to replicate that in our commercial aerospace businesses when we begin to see some volume recovery.

So when we originally built our plan for 2021, we just assumed the 40 A320s flat through the year. We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let's say, 32 to 38 -- sorry, 32 to 35 build sets we guesstimate.",494,"Okay. So when we originally built our plan for 2021, we just assumed the 40 A320s flat through the year. We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let's say, 32 to 38 -- sorry, 32 to 35 build sets we guesstimate. It's always difficult, both when you're at the both first tier and through second-tier levels in the supply chain. And as you know, through our engine products business, we operate through both GE Aviation and also Pratt & Whitney for the 2 engine variants for the A320.
My expectation is that destocking will -- I'm going to take a swag at this now. We think that will have completely dried up by the end of the second quarter. And we're going to have to start building some products ahead, particularly as it goes to the 45 rate in the fourth quarter this year. So that's what I call the -- when will -- we all won bright spots, and we've got 2 commercial transportation in now this Airbus lift, and that gives us -- it brings a little bit of a smile to our face.
On the other hand, for Boeing at the moment, the -- they state they've been building at 7 per month in the back end of 2020. Whereas we know we've been supplying less than half of that rate. So small numbers. And we just expect that to continue certainly through the first half of this year. And then when they raise it to, is it 10 and 20, and then hopefully, into the 30s by the second quarter of '22, then well before then, we'll have start matching the run rate of part shipments to the build rate of aircraft.
Now the question is when does that occur? And the -- I don't have a lot of information regarding the clearance of the Boeing inventory at this point. I note the Ryanair order. I note that there were 27 deliveries of the 737 out of the 450 aircraft parked up in the fourth -- I think in the fourth quarter for Boeing, which is great. But we know that given the fact that they've built is 20 aircraft in the fourth quarter. That just -- or just a little below the build rate -- more than the build rate, sorry.
So there's still a lot to go. And so once we see that inventory dissipating as the information begins to flow this year, I think we'll become increasingly confident in the Boeing stated build rates. Bear in mind, to date, in actual terms, all we've seen is reductions sequentially for the last 18 months. And we obviously note the planned increases. But for us to feel confident, we've got to see that aircraft park dissipated. And those increase in build rates reconfirm to us, so we tend to be a little bit cautious at this point in time."

We've got a nice improvement there on the pension cash contributions and OPEB contributions on a year-over-year basis. As you know, as we exited 2020 as the discount rate didn't work favorably for us, it was about 80 bps unfavorable, that cost us around $200 million on the liability side. Asset returns were very strong for the business, over 14%. So that kind of netted out. But when you look at the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB program, especially over the last 12 months, we're going to see a favorability there.
The other things I would look at the tax rate pretty much the same as what we've had before. You can see interest expense that's most likely going to be as you do the walk around $290 million for the year. And the big question, David, and I know you're focused on it like we are, is the working capital, right? As we look at 2020, working capital was not a source or use of cash in 2020, right? We took down the AR securitization program, which was a $100 million burn in that number. So that's all embedded there. So it wasn't a source or use even when we consider the bring down to the AR securitization program.
So as we move into 2021, we think, working capital, and this is all going to depend on, as John talked about the revenue ramp as we go to the second half of the year as well as some of the stranded inventory as we clear that out of the channel. I expect working capital to be a modest source of cash embedded in that $400 million guide that we gave you."

In my feelings on the cash balances, the thing I'm focused on more than anything at the moment is our 2022 bond maturities. And let's say, if we wanted to, should we just roll them up on the due date or should we move early, that's a consideration, which we are sort of thinking about. And so that's in the, I'll call it, in the in-basket. In terms of further share repurchases of any note. My thoughts there are is the trigger, I think, for us to be more aggressive in that regard would be seeing solidification of the, I'm going to call, commercial aerospace build rate.
And so the way I think about it is we've done some modest picking off of the shares over the last couple of quarters in terms of, would I want to be bolder than that in any significant way than it would be, once I'm convinced that the aircraft build skylines, solidify becomes [indiscernible] from a fluid state, is it this or is it that? What's the widebody rate really going to be? That's the trigger for me to be more aggressive on the -- on that side. So taking cash and deploying into the share buyback of any major notice, the trigger for that is all centered on if the skyline solidifies to a build I feel confident in. I see those skylines begin to lift, particularly as we go in the back half into '22. I see inventory being put into the system because those builds are scheduled rather than just talked about. And the good news is that we are told that we're going to see those Airbus increases, actually scheduled in February.
And as -- so we haven't seen them in the first 2 or 3 days. But we say, by the end of the month, we'll see those in production releases. And then when you see that, you get more of a confidence than just a new skyline number. Because, as you know, that skyline, even on the more confident Airbus side move from -- maybe it's going from 40 to 47 to, let's see 43 than a 45 before moving maybe to a 48 in '22. So I'd like to see it in schedule form rather than just news media form, and we need to just see what's widebody doing and then the clearance of the inventory for Boeing. And I think that's the point where I say, yes, we're good. We'll have a pretty good view of what our incremental margins will be as we see that demand increase and then it's off to the races, maybe in terms of any cash deployment for share buyback."

So when you think about last year compared to the $400 million normal revenues we have, for example, in our engine business for commercial aerospace, the effective run rate for the last couple of quarters has been like 75%, 80%, even 85% down if we look at certain months. So we've just assumed that, that just continues, and we are not seeing anything and not choosing to believe at the moment that there could be an increase just because what's been the life of it, what's still out there, what could be cannibalized and moved off.
We note that a couple of our customers are providing commentary around solidification of that into the back half of the year. And I think we're willing to accept that, albeit at the moment, again, it's difficult to plan for it. I've always thought that we'd see some narrow-body build rate increase is necessarily before we'd see a large increase in MRO.

The investment is exactly the same as previously stated, $650 million as we think. It covers both the casting, coring, hole drilling, machining, coatings. So there's a lot of stuff in there.

Military budgets even in the course of the year don't -- I'd say don't necessarily move all in a similar percentage as often a little bit of a hike towards the end of the year. Money is spent.

And so my thought is that maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit higher just because we have seen that in previous years as well. Having said all of that, we believe our defense sales will be solid and increasing in 2021. The F-35 maybe a more modest part of that in terms of OE build, maybe slightly more in spares build, but nothing of great note at this point and we just see generally the military budget for '21 remains healthy.

I'll return to the call to talk to guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2021.
Please move to Slide 4. Let me start with some commentary on the first quarter. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.7%, similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22, which was ahead of expectations and ahead of Q4 2020.
Historically, Q1 has been a significant cash outflow for the company. However, with improved margins and enhanced working capital control, the outcome has noticeably improved. This will be followed by cash generation in quarters 2, 3 and 4.
Lastly, in the first quarter, we focused on deleveraging, completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes at par for approximately $360 million of cash in -- using cash in hand. The resulting quarter end cash balance was $1.24 billion. Moreover, on May 3, we completed the early redemption of the $476 million of notes due in 2022 for approximately $500 million, inclusive of the accrued interest and fees. Both transactions were completed with cash on hand. 
Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $840 million, which reduces the 2021 interest expense by $38 million and $47 million on a run rate basis. In addition, in 2022, there will be a carryover interest savings of $10 million.
Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q1 revenue was the same as the Q2 to Q4 2020 average and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was down 52%, driven by the lingering effects of customer inventory reductions and fundamentally lower builds, starting with the Boeing MAX. Commercial aerospace continues to represent 40% of the total revenue of the company, compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by continued strength in our other markets. Defense aerospace was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter new builds and spares. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 35% year-over-year, also driven by new builds and spares. Lastly, the commercial transportation business was up 15% year-over-year, despite customer supply chain constraints. Although truck demand is very strong, our customers managed through supply chain issues with several commodities, which are in short supply, including semiconductors, tires and glass, to name just a few. We are working closely with our customers to meet demand, which is showing some interruptions.
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations, with a $61 million year-over-year benefit. Segment decremental margins continue to be good at 27%, driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost management. CapEx was $55 million in the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.7% and consistent with Q4 2020 on approximately $30 million of less revenue. Q1 revenue of $1.2 billion was consistent with the Q4 -- Q2 to Q4 2020 average. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic with a 300 basis point EBITDA margin expansion while revenue was approximately $45 million less than the same period, so good year-on-year performance.
Now let me turn it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets."

Q1 revenue was down 26%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 52% year-over-year, in line with our projections, as we continue to see customer inventory corrections as expected. Defense aerospace continues to grow and was up 12% in Q1 as we are on a diverse set of programs, with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 15% year-over-year with a very strong market demand. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which consists of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was up 1%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up a healthy 35% year-over-year.
I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials."

Now let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the first quarter.

As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 55%, driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 18% in defense aerospace and a 35% increase in IGT. IGT continues to be strong, and we will continue to make investments in this business as demand has been increasing for cleaner energy. Decremental margins for engines were 26% for the quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's decremental margins for Q3 2020 through Q1 2021.
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 29% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 42%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. The industrial and commercial transportation markets were down 2% year-over-year, but up 19% sequentially. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 45% for the first quarter as furloughed workers returned to work.
Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. For Engineered Structures, year-over-year revenue was down 36% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 57%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the 787 and 737 MAX. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 10% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 18% for the quarter, compared to 24% in Q4.
Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue increased 19% year-over-year despite customer supply chain constraints. Forged Wheels revenue grew faster than the overall market, in part due to Howmet's new innovative 39-pound wheel. Segment operating profit margin was another record at almost 31% as year-over-year incremental margins were 56%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries.
Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. First, we completed 2 early redemptions of our bonds. The first transaction was on January 15. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption at par of the 2021 bonds due in April 2021. By paying down the bonds 3 months early at no additional cost, we saved $5 million of interest.
The second transaction was earlier this week on May 3. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption of the bonds that are due in February 2022. The bonds were redeemed at a cost of approximately $500 million. As a result, the interest costs have been reduced by approximately $47 million year-over-year. Moreover, as John has mentioned, in 2022, we'll get an incremental $10 million of carryover interest savings. Gross debt stands at $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn.
Before I turn it back to John to discuss the 2021 guidance, I would point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the quarter were a charge for approximately $16 million after tax, and the charge was primarily related to 3 items: first, we had fire costs at 2 of our plants of $7 million; second, we had an impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in France of $4 million; and third, we had a pension settlement charge in the U.S. of $3 million.
Finally, we continue to work on reducing legacy liabilities and improving asset returns for the pension plan. I would highlight 2 significant items: First, we had announced a planned administration change of certain prescription drug benefits that is expected to reduce cost and reduce our OPEB liability by approximately 20% or $39 million; second, we are benefiting from pension asset investment returns of over 13% that we realized in 2020. The combination of the asset returns and the liability reduction have decreased annual pension and OPEB expense by 37% or $13 million annually.
So now let me turn it back over to John."

Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the g",736,"Thanks, Ken. Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the growth and solidity at the defense aerospace, IGT and commercial transportation markets. There are a series of leading indicators that are showing very well for us: numbers of flight inquiries; bookings of flights; hotels and car rentals; and we also note the increase in U.S.A. TSA numbers, flight takeoffs, particularly in the U.S. and China. Europe remains somewhat muted given the effects of the pandemic and slower implementation of COVID vaccines. All of this should begin to help airlines with aircraft production, particularly of narrow-body aircraft. We note that the demand for wide-body aircraft probably may not reappear until mid-2022 or even into 2023. 
We see at the end of the second quarter as to be an inflection point to the beginnings of production increases for Hermes in the second half of the year, with the exact precise timing yet to be determined. We are planning to bring back from furlough or recruit several hundred workers during the next 2 quarters to train and retrain to be ready for this demand, just in the same effective way that we did in the third quarter of 2020 for the commercial wheels business. My expectation is that these costs plus cost of recommencing mothballed plant and equipment will hold EBITDA margins at around the 22% level until further stabilization is reached. We also know that there is an effect on the commercial transportation market of part shortages, particularly semiconductors, which is reducing shifts and production work in the second quarter.
As noted earlier today, the timing for cash generation has been a focus for us. And instead of the normal large Q1 outflow, which then has to be subsequently overcome, the first quarter was essentially breakeven and all subsequent quarters are expected to be cash generative. Specifically, the guidance for Q2: sales at $1.2 billion, plus or minus $30 million; EBITDA of $265 million, plus or minus $5 million; EBITDA margin of 22.1%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.20, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, sales of $5.1 billion, plus $100 million, minus $50 million; EBITDA line increases -- the EBITDA baseline increases by $50 million to $1.15 billion, with a range of plus $50 million to minus $25 million; EBITDA margin baseline has now increased to 22.5%, plus 60 basis points and minus 20 basis points in terms of a range. The earnings per share baseline increases to $0.95, a significant increase over prior guidance and with a range of plus $0.07 to minus $0.04. And the cash flow baseline increased to $425 million, plus or minus $30 million.
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We noted that second half revenue is expected to be up 12% for the total company, driven by the increases in commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Price increases to be greater than 2020. Cost reduction carryover of approximately $100 million. And pension and OPEB contributions of $160 million. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the American Rescue Plan Act upon pension contributions, and we'll determine those later in the year. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation and amortization of $270 million. And adjusted free cash flow conversion is about 100% of net income. We plan to reinstate the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in the third quarter of 2021, pending the final Board approval.
Now please move to Slide 14. To summarize, Q1 was a healthy start to the year, and liquidity of the company continues to be strong. The guidance provided is raised from that given in early February and reflects our first quarter profitability strength. The redemption of bonds for cash, the reinstitution of the dividend, all of which provide value to shareholders. More broadly, the focus is now turning to the beginning of the revenue recovery in the second half, commencing with commercial aerospace and the run rate of both revenues and margins as we exit 2021 and move into 2022, where we see the prospect of further leading indicator improvements. 
Thank you, and now we'll take your questions."

So the way I think about it is in terms of sequence of the transition and with the end of the second quarter being the transition from basically the current holding part and result of the reduced demand and then the correction of the inventory to our customers. And already, we know that commercial transportation is going well, subject to those interruptions because of supply shortages. The big third comes in commercial aerospace, we believe, at the end of the second quarter. And I think that's going to be led by the engines business in terms of the first uptick in demand with -- and supported by structures, with fasteners probably still being a little bit behind that by another quarter or so. So my picture for the year is that commercial aerospace, I think, year-on-year, we're going to see that segment up 15% to 20% in the third quarter compared to second. Second quarter will be a reduced decrement compared to what we see the 52% currently. And then as that increase that we see as the turn occurs will be led by engine, supported by structures, with fasteners following maybe fourth quarter or even at the end of the year just as those inventories are absorbed then with what we think will be a fairly a significant snapback in the first part of 2022. So that gives the sequence that I expect both for the commercial aerospace markets and how it affects each of our segments through the next 3 quarters."

In fact, I think I called it smorgasbord of opportunity to do various things. What we considered is the first order of battle was to deal with the next couple of maturities of our bonds. We did that easily from cash on hand. And that obviously produces a lower interest burden for the company, lower gross debt. And therefore, it's also seen some improvement from rates. So that's been, I think, a good step for us.
And now the next thing you have to address at some point, but not, I don't think, just now is the October 2024 at some point. So that's 3.5 years away in terms of bonds. So I'd say that part of the balance sheet is dealt with. We felt confident in the cash flows of the business to reinstate the dividend. That's an expression of our confidence and, again, part of our plan to return money to shareholders.
And then the other 2 aspects that we have to consider is what about share repurchase and also to what degree, if anything, do we participate in any M&A activity, which may materialize over the next, say, year or so as the commercial aerospace market solidifies into, let's say, skylines and confidence that we all can believe in. Clearly, that's beginning to happen given what I said about the inflection point that we see coming. And I guess, we're in that position, David, that you said, is that if all things work out as planned, is that we'll have a very significant cash balance at the end of the year and have the ability to make other decisions in capital deployment in the future. So I think it's always well in terms of, let's say, the whole capital allocation strategy that we set out for ourselves in the recent months."

So obviously, the shift in focus is moving to going back up in production and then bringing people back from furlough, training and the like. But one of the things that we used to talk about before this all went down was yield, whether that's first pass yields or roll throughput yields in some of those key spots in your facilities. When you look at yields and production facilities today versus where those were when we were talking about shortages and engine OEM factories 2 years ago or so, how does that stand today? And how does that play into your confidence and conviction around going up without hiccups?"

When I look at the last couple of years in our aerospace business. I think one of the untold stories is the improvement in delivery performance and our quality levels where it's been reducing arrears, whether it's being parts per mining defects or e",361,"Okay. When I look at the last couple of years in our aerospace business. I think one of the untold stories is the improvement in delivery performance and our quality levels where it's been reducing arrears, whether it's being parts per mining defects or even in total scrap in our manufacturing plants. And yields have clearly have definitely improved both for defense aerospace and commercial aerospace segments. And so it's all good.
I really want to protect reputation and reliability with our customers and really seek to do that by bringing labor back and training it. So I think the things we did last year in the third quarter for our wheels business have paid off handsomely in terms of our ability to increase production with excellent quality and deliver these very significant incremental margins that we've seen in that wheels business.
And so rather than, I think, stumble through this, we're trying to be ahead of it, being planned for on labor and recognizing that there is a training time or retraining for people to be able to deliver the yields that we currently have and hopefully continue to improve them. So that's why I want to plan carefully through the next couple of quarters because we are talking a very significant increase in labor. Obviously, we'll be tailoring it to and trimming it exactly as we see to go through it. But I really want to be ahead of this thing and not chasing it and having yield issues, arrears build and all the consequences that, that puts upon the business. So if it cost us, let's say, a couple of -- 200, 300 basis points or whatever margin for a quarter or so, I think that's money really well spent because it's going to be what's the margin as we exit this year and how do we perform into 2022. So really trying to be planful about the next phase of our business and not just react to it after the event and that you seem to be scrambling. So that's all part of the value we bring to, I think, to the industry and to our customers."

So we need to recognize the situation we're all in with carrying some trapped inventory. And we still have trapped inventory, which we plan to liquidate during the balance of 2021. And it's really interesting. Because when we look at our inventory levels as we move through the year, one of recent discussions in our quarterly review has been to what degree do we hold on to some of those in the latter part of the year just so again we're in a really strong position as we enter 2022 with what we think will be a fairly strong year for us in terms of demand.
So where we find ourselves at the moment is our customers know that there's metal in the system and there's trapped inventory. And so we're more on that 3 to 6 months of lead times. And people have been holding off, and we've been seeing that fill in very significantly in the last few weeks. And then obviously, it's like everything is going to depend. But I do see, if we look at 6 months from now, then those lead times are going to be significantly increased. And therefore, orders are going to have to be placed. Otherwise, with some of the production increases on narrow-bodies, in particular, that Airbus and Boeing are looking at for 2022 and certainly later in 2020, I mean they won't occur unless orders are placed. Because the availability of that inventory and the current excess of metals has been in the system for the last year just won't be there."

I guess our job not to allow those more fixed cost to creep back into the system. And they also, indeed, try to be sticky on those variable costs as we go back up the production volume curve. So we are expecting healthy incremental margins.
And part of it is also getting that labor in place at the right time and trained and ready, as I tried as described on a couple of questions ago. So we don't stumble our way through this. It's planfully set out and accepting it as if it cost us 200 or 300 basis points of margin, not being 100 -- 20 or 30 basis points of margin.

So when we look at Q2 this year, because some of the schedules have not been reduced that significantly, although they were reduced and you say plants were closed down, it's a very, I'll call, turbulent quarter to comp against. And so the way I look at it is more, let's say, on a sequential basis, where I'm thinking that, well, commercial aero was down 52%, going to be down a lot less than that in terms of build comparisons.
And then the only other muting effect I'm thinking about at the moment is we are careful in terms of the commercial truck build plans of our customers, just because of those part shortages. So we are seeing shifts go down and customers take weeks out in the second quarter. And that's part of what we are guiding to as well, including that in our numbers as best as we can estimate it at this point in time. So it's a fairly, I must say, careful assumption around the commercial transportation business for the second quarter.
At the same time, I would say to you now the flip side of that is that order intake for us pretty much globally has been very healthy. And you've seen Class 8 truck and trailer orders at levels now which essentially secure the backlog for the balance of 2021 and most of the way through 2022 at the moment. And so -- whereas before, we were thinking we had a fairly good trajectory, but it wasn't filled in totally. Now we you see that demand so strong. 
So for example, if you wanted to buy a new trailer to go with your truck at the moment, if you ordered it today, you wouldn't be thinking about taking delivery for 12 months. You're looking out into the second quarter of 2022. Now that's how long lead times are in the commercial transportation industry. So that's really very healthy for us and really puts a very solid platform on 2022 and never mind the half of this year. So I just want to give you the full picture around that. And so if we're cautious on, I'll call, supply-based interruptions the truck build in the very short term, given the strength of the economy, what we see by way of transportation and shipping of things, it's producing a very solid picture for backlog for the next, let's say, 18 months."

But that's how we see it at the moment. So different flavors for those different segments according to basically lead times and trying to get ahead of it.

If you look at the traditional split going back to -- you got to have to go back to 2019 because it's been moving around. And I'm just trying to keep all of these numbers in my head, but it's like a 60-40 narrow -- maybe 55-45 narrow to wide-body split. That has shifted the same as Boeing and Airbus has shifted over the last 12 months. So give you a picture on that. I think, traditionally, Boeing would have been 60, Airbus 40, split the other way, and they could rebalance again in 2021, to some degree, as the MAX gets back up and going.
For engines, I actually don't keep the numbers in my head in terms of what the exact split is. Certainly, in terms of what we see over the next 12, 18 months is that the narrow-body engines, so think LEAP 1A, LEAP 1B and then obviously, some of the aftermarket service business coming back, particularly for the CFM engines. So what we see begin to fill in the back of the year to 2022. But I think that's best I can do at this point. I can't exactly remember between wide and narrow for engine and maybe we haven't geared it."

Oil and gas has been really very muted for the last year and the first half of this year. But we -- our thought process is that maybe in the fourth quarter or certainly by the first quarter of next year, we think in the oil and gas begins to show an improvement for us. We see Texas crude now at $66, plus or minus. And natural gas has moved up. Rig count has moved up significantly for the Gulf.

If you -- to give you a picture, if you go back, 2019 as the reference point, $800 million of spares, which essentially is engine, plus -- on top of that, fasteners and structure business. It was $400 million of defense and industrial that grew, let's say, let's call it, 20% over the last year or so. So healthy growth there. But for the most part, the spares or parts we sell through to the shops through our customers just dropped off a cliff in the second half of last year. So basically, you see limited demand, but still a demand like commercial business jet and some very modest levels of spares business. And that picture through that is first half of this year is pretty much the same as the back half of last year. So compared to $100 million a quarter, I think, more like $20 million a quarter, it can be below that, could be just above it, just depends on the quarter. It's just bouncing around with small numbers.
In the second half of this year, I think we're expecting a modest lift, but not planning for anything significant in that spares business in the second half at this point, but let's say a little bit higher than that. That's clear compared to the $20 million a quarter, thinking more like that $25 million to $30 million a quarter. It doesn't move the need of for us at this point in time. I think it will in '22.

We've done a lot of efforts in our business to try to grow it, not just in OE demand, but also through distribution. And at the moment, I think it's good and clear that we've called it out, being probably a couple of quarters behind where we see some of the other parts of our commercial aerospace business are beginning to respond. And so I think that's a fairly thought-through and quality view of the market at this point. I recognize that we do have extended change. So for example, part of our -- if you could just take the North American business, and so I'll just comply my comments to that. Yes, we'll supply directly to Boeing. So that's part of the demand. But we also supply into -- in Spirit. And therefore, it's another step in the supply chain. And what we're clear is that we've been supplying at the low rate for some time. We're not trying to be optimistic in saying we're going to see that recover in the Q3 or Q4. We've been saying it's a couple of quarters behind and do think that it will begin to recover or will maybe even -- maybe it's the Buick comment -- or is it snapback. I think we're going to see significant demand increases for our partner business in 2022.

So you can begin to work out if you just apply an average direct labor cost per employee for that sort of numbers and average through a quarter. You can see the sort of costs that we're talking about this being there.

Good morning, and welcome to the call. Similar to last quarter, I will give an overview of Howmet's first quarter performance, then pass to Tolga, who will talk to our markets, and then Ken will provide further financial detail.

Similar to last quarter, I will give an overview of Howmet's first quarter performance, then pass to Tolga, who will talk to our markets, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. I'll return to the call to talk to guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2021.
Please move to Slide 4. Let me start with some commentary on the first quarter. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.7%, similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22, which was ahead of expectations and ahead of Q4 2020.
Historically, Q1 has been a significant cash outflow for the company. However, with improved margins and enhanced working capital control, the outcome has noticeably improved. This will be followed by cash generation in quarters 2, 3 and 4.
Lastly, in the first quarter, we focused on deleveraging, completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes at par for approximately $360 million of cash in -- using cash in hand. The resulting quarter end cash balance was $1.24 billion. Moreover, on May 3, we completed the early redemption of the $476 million of notes due in 2022 for approximately $500 million, inclusive of the accrued interest and fees. Both transactions were completed with cash on hand.
Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $840 million, which reduces the 2021 interest expense by $38 million and $47 million on a run rate basis. In addition, in 2022, there will be a carryover interest savings of $10 million.
Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q1 revenue was the same as the Q2 to Q4 2020 average and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was down 52%, driven by the lingering effects of customer inventory reductions and fundamentally lower builds, starting with the Boeing MAX. Commercial aerospace continues to represent 40% of the total revenue of the company, compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by continued strength in our other markets. Defense aerospace was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter new builds and spares. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 35% year-over-year, also driven by new builds and spares.
Lastly, the commercial transportation business was up 15% year-over-year, despite customer supply chain constraints. Although truck demand is very strong, our customers managed through supply chain issues with several commodities, which are in short supply, including semiconductors, tires and glass, to name just a few. We are working closely with our customers to meet demand, which is showing some interruptions.
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations, with a $61 million year-over-year benefit. Segment decremental margins continue to be good at 27%, driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost management. CapEx was $55 million in the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.7% and consistent with Q4 2020 on approximately $30 million of less revenue. Q1 revenue of $1.2 billion was consistent with the Q4 -- Q2 to Q4 2020 average. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic with a 300 basis point EBITDA margin expansion while revenue was approximately $45 million less than the same period, so good year-on-year performance.
Now let me turn it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets."

Q1 revenue was down 26%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 52% year-over-year, in line with our projections, as we continue to see customer inventory corrections as expected.
Defense aerospace continues to grow and was up 12% in Q1 as we are on a diverse set of programs, with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 15% year-over-year with a very strong market demand. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which consists of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was up 1%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up a healthy 35% year-over-year.
I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials."

As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 55%, driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 18% in defense aerospace and a 35% increase in IGT. IGT continues to be strong, and we will continue to make investments in this business as demand has been increasing for cleaner energy. Decremental margins for engines were 26% for the quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's decremental margins for Q3 2020 through Q1 2021.
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 29% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 42%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. The industrial and commercial transportation markets were down 2% year-over-year, but up 19% sequentially. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 45% for the first quarter as furloughed workers returned to work.
Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. For Engineered Structures, year-over-year revenue was down 36% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 57%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the 787 and 737 MAX. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 10% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 18% for the quarter, compared to 24% in Q4.
Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue increased 19% year-over-year despite customer supply chain constraints. Forged Wheels revenue grew faster than the overall market, in part due to Howmet's new innovative 39-pound wheel. Segment operating profit margin was another record at almost 31% as year-over-year incremental margins were 56%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries.
Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. First, we completed 2 early redemptions of our bonds. The first transaction was on January 15. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption at par of the 2021 bonds due in April 2021. By paying down the bonds 3 months early at no additional cost, we saved $5 million of interest.
The second transaction was earlier this week on May 3. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption of the bonds that are due in February 2022. The bonds were redeemed at a cost of approximately $500 million. As a result, the interest costs have been reduced by approximately $47 million year-over-year. Moreover, as John has mentioned, in 2022, we'll get an incremental $10 million of carryover interest savings. Gross debt stands at $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn.
Before I turn it back to John to discuss the 2021 guidance, I would point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the quarter were a charge for approximately $16 million after tax, and the charge was primarily related to 3 items: first, we had fire costs at 2 of our plants of $7 million; second, we had an impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in France of $4 million; and third, we had a pension settlement charge in the U.S. of $3 million.
Finally, we continue to work on reducing legacy liabilities and improving asset returns for the pension plan. I would highlight 2 significant items: first, we had announced a planned administration change of certain prescription drug benefits that is expected to reduce cost and reduce our OPEB liability by approximately 20% or $39 million; second, we are benefiting from pension asset investment returns of over 13% that we realized in 2020. The combination of the asset returns and the liability reduction have decreased annual pension and OPEB expense by 37% or $13 million annually.
So now let me turn it back over to John."

Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the g",736,"Thanks, Ken. Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the growth and solidity at the defense aerospace, IGT and commercial transportation markets.
There are a series of leading indicators that are showing very well for us: numbers of flight inquiries, bookings of flights, hotels and car rentals, and we also note the increase in U.S.A. TSA numbers, flight takeoffs, particularly in the U.S. and China. Europe remains somewhat muted given the effects of the pandemic and slower implementation of COVID vaccines. All of this should begin to help airlines with aircraft production, particularly of narrow-body aircraft. We note that the demand for wide-body aircraft probably may not reappear until mid-2022 or even into 2023.
We see at the end of the second quarter as to be an inflection point to the beginnings of production increases for Howmet in the second half of the year, with the exact precise timing yet to be determined. We are planning to bring back from furlough or recruit several hundred workers during the next 2 quarters to train and retrain to be ready for this demand, just in the same effective way that we did in the third quarter of 2020 for the commercial wheels business. My expectation is that these costs plus cost of recommencing mothball plants and equipment will hold EBITDA margins at around the 22% level until further stabilization is reached.
We also know that there is an effect on the commercial transportation market of part shortages, particularly semiconductors, which is reducing shifts and production work in the second quarter. As noted earlier today, the timing for cash generation has been a focus for us. And instead of the normal large Q1 outflow, which then has to be subsequently overcome, the first quarter was essentially breakeven and all subsequent quarters are expected to be cash generative.
Specifically, the guidance for Q2: sales at $1.2 billion, plus or minus $30 million; EBITDA of $265 million, plus or minus $5 million; EBITDA margin of 22.1%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.20, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, sales of $5.1 billion, plus $100 million, minus $50 million; EBITDA line increases -- the EBITDA baseline increases by $50 million to $1.15 billion, with a range of plus $50 million to minus $25 million; EBITDA margin baseline has now increased to 22.5%, plus 60 basis points and minus 20 basis points in terms of a range. The earnings per share baseline increases to $0.95, a significant increase over prior guidance and with a range of plus $0.07 to minus $0.04. And the cash flow baseline increased to $425 million, plus or minus $30 million.
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We noted that second half revenue is expected to be up 12% for the total company, driven by the increases in commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Price increases to be greater than 2020. Cost reduction carryover of approximately $100 million, and pension and OPEB contributions of $160 million. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the American Rescue Plan Act upon pension contributions and we'll determine those later in the year.
CapEx is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation and amortization of $270 million. And adjusted free cash flow conversion is about 100% of net income. We plan to reinstate the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in the third quarter of 2021, pending the final Board approval.
Now please move to Slide 14. To summarize, Q1 was a healthy start to the year, and liquidity of the company continues to be strong. The guidance provided is raised from that given in early February and reflects our first quarter profitability strength. The redemption of bonds for cash, the reinstitution of the dividend, all of which provide value to shareholders. More broadly, the focus is now turning to the beginning of the revenue recovery in the second half, commencing with commercial aerospace and the run rate of both revenues and margins as we exit 2021 and move into 2022, where we see the prospect of further leading indicator improvements.
Thank you, and now we'll take your questions."

So the way I think about it is in terms of sequence of the transition and with the end of the second quarter being the transition from basically the current holding part and [ recent ] results of the reduced demand and then the correction of the inventory to our customers. And already, we know that commercial transportation is going well, subject to those, I'll say, interruptions because of supply shortages. The big third comes in commercial aerospace, we believe, at the end of the second quarter. And I think that's going to be led by the engines business in terms of the first uptick in demand with -- and supported by structures, with fasteners probably still being a little bit behind that by another quarter or so.
So my picture for the year is that commercial aerospace, I think, year-on-year, we're going to see that segment up 15% to 20% in the third quarter compared to second. Second quarter will be a reduced decrement compared to what we see the 52% currently. And then as that increase that we see as the turn occurs will be led by engine, supported by structures, with fasteners following maybe fourth quarter or even at the end of the year just as those inventories are absorbed then with what we think will be a fairly a significant snapback in the first part of 2022. So that gives the sequence that I expect both for the commercial aerospace markets and how it affects each of our segments through the next 3 quarters."

So it seems set well at the moment. We're still, as I said on the previous call, have been supplying effectively below the 7 rate per month in aggregate. Obviously, different levels go into different product lines. But we are expecting to see being in line with shipset values to equal production and then the lift of production as we go forward.
So that's all built into what we think would be that 20% increase in commercial aero in the -- commencing in the third quarter. And also supported by the increase in production that in narrow-body for the A320 for Airbus as well."

In fact, I think I called it smorgasbord of opportunity to do various things. What we considered is the first order of battle was to deal with the next couple of maturities of our bonds. We did that easily from cash on hand. And that obviously produces a lower interest burden for the company, lower gross debt. And therefore, it's also seen some improvement from the rating agencies. So that's been, I think, a good step for us.
And now the next thing you have to address at some point, but not, I don't think, just now is the October 2024 at some point. So that's 3.5 years away in terms of bonds. So I'd say that part of the balance sheet is dealt with. We felt confident in the cash flows of the business to reinstate the dividend. That's an expression of our confidence and, again, part of our plan to return money to shareholders.
And then the other 2 aspects that we have to consider is what about share repurchase and also to what degree, if anything, do we participate in any M&A activity, which may materialize over the next, say, year or so as the commercial aerospace market solidifies into, let's say, skylines and the confidence that we all can believe in. Clearly, that's beginning to happen given what I said about the inflection point that we see coming. And I guess, we're in that position, David, that you said, is that if all things work out as planned, is that we'll have a very significant cash balance at the end of the year and have the ability to make other decisions in capital deployment in the future.
So I think it's always well in terms of, let's say, the whole capital allocation strategy that we set out for ourselves in the recent months."

When I look at the last couple of years in our aerospace business, I think one of the untold stories is the improvement in delivery performance and our quality levels where it's been reducing arrears, whether it's being parts per mining defects or even internal scrap in our manufacturing plants. And yields have clearly have definitely improved both for defense aerospace and commercial aerospace segments. And so it's all good.
I really want to protect reputation and reliability with our customers and really seek to do that by bringing labor back and training it. So I think the things we did last year in the third quarter for our wheels business have paid off handsomely in terms of our ability to increase production with excellent quality and deliver these very significant incremental margins that we've seen in that wheels business.
And so rather than, I think, stumble through this, we're trying to be ahead of it, being planful on labor and recognizing that there is a training time or retraining for people to be able to deliver the yields that we currently have and hopefully continue to improve them. So that's why I want to plan carefully through the next couple of quarters because we are talking a very significant increase in labor. Obviously, we'll be tailoring it to and then trimming it exactly as we see to go through it. But I really want to be ahead of this thing and not chasing it and having yield issues and arrears build and all the consequences that, that puts upon the business.
So if it cost us, let's say, a couple of -- 200, 300 basis points or whatever margin for a quarter or so, I think that's money really well spent because it's going to be what's the margin as we exit this year and how do we perform into 2022. So really trying to be planful about the next phase of our business and not just react to it after the event and that you seem to be scrambling. So that's all part of the value we bring to, I think, to the industry and to our customers."

The way I see it at the moment is everybody is aware there's plenty of metal in the system, and that gives people, I'll say, the ability to drop in a little bit later than would have been normal. If you looked at the demand levels of 2019 where lead times were, let's say, to get metal for some of our products was over 12 months. So we need to recognize the situation we're all in with carrying some trapped inventory. And we still have trapped inventory, which we plan to liquidate during the balance of 2021.
And it's really interesting. Because when we look at our inventory levels as we move through the year, one of recent discussions in our quarterly review has been to what degree do we hold on to some of those in the latter part of the year just so again we're in a really strong position as we enter 2022 with what we think will be a fairly strong year for us in terms of demand.
So where we find ourselves at the moment is our customers know that there's metal in the system, we know there's trapped inventory. And so we're more on that 3 to 6 months of lead times. And people have been holding off, and we've been seeing that fill in very significantly in the last few weeks. And then obviously, it's like everything is going to depend. But I do see, if we look at 6 months from now, then those lead times are going to be significantly increased. And therefore, orders are going to have to be placed.
Otherwise, with some of the production increases on narrow-bodies, in particular, that Airbus and Boeing are looking at for 2022 and certainly later in 2022, I mean they won't occur unless orders are placed because the availability of that inventory and the current excess of metals has just been in the system for the last year just won't be there."

And it's our job not to allow those more fixed cost to creep back into the system. And they also, indeed, try to be sticky on those variable costs as we go back up the production volume curve. So we are expecting healthy incremental margins.
And part of it is also getting that labor in place at the right time and trained and ready, as I tried to describe on a couple of questions ago. So we don't stumble our way through this.

So when we look at Q2 this year, because some of the schedules have not been reduced that significantly, although they were reduced and you say plants were closed down, it's a very, I'll call, turbulent quarter to comp against. And so the way I look at it is more, let's say, on a sequential basis, where I'm thinking that, well, commercial aero was down 52%, it's going to be down a lot less than that in terms of build comparisons.
And then the only other muting effect I'm thinking about at the moment is we are careful in terms of the commercial truck build plans of our customers, just because of those part shortages. So we are seeing shifts go down and customers take weeks out in the second quarter. And that's part of what we are guiding to as well, including that in our numbers as best as we can estimate it at this point in time. So it's a fairly, I must say, careful assumption around the commercial transportation business for the second quarter.
At the same time, I would say to you now the flip side of that is that order intake for us pretty much globally has been very healthy. And you've seen class 8 truck and trailer orders at levels now, which essentially secure the backlog for the balance of 2021 and most of the way through 2022 at the moment. And so -- whereas before, we were thinking we had a fairly good trajectory, but it wasn't filled in totally. Now you see that demand so strong.
So for example, if you wanted to buy a new trailer to go with your truck at the moment, if you ordered it today, you wouldn't be thinking about taking delivery for 12 months. So you're looking out into the second quarter of 2022. Now that's how long lead times are in the commercial transportation industry. So that's really very healthy for us and really puts a very solid platform on 2022 and never mind the balance of this year.
So I just want to give you the full picture around that. And so if we're cautious on, I'll call, supply-based interruptions the truck build in the very short term, given the strength of the economy, what we see by way of transportation and shipping of things, it's producing a very solid picture for backlog for the next, let's say, 18 months."

And then we think, and it's like it's the best judgment that basically that just essentially stops and so at the end of the second quarter. So we begin to see our structures business in the second half where we're planning for increased production. We're seeing it clearly. I've already mentioned the engine-based business and the only business which is going to lag for, again, a couple of quarters behind that is going to be our fastener business where I think we're going to be close on, balanced all inventories up by the -- maybe by the end of the third quarter, could stray into Q4.
But that's how we see it at the moment. So different flavors for those different segments according to basically lead times and trying to get ahead of it. Because I think one thing our customers don't want to have is some of the supply constraints, particularly around engine parts, which are really long lead-time items ultimately. They're on the same constraints as we saw a couple of years ago."

So if you're thinking Airbus A350s as an example or Boeing 787s and with those composite structures more titanium, whole different suite of fasteners, then you can see that impact in the way we've laid out our revenue expectations with then, as we said, I'll say, an improving situation somewhat behind the engine business.
If you look at the traditional split going back to -- you got to have to go back to 2019 because it's been moving around. And I'm just trying to keep all of these numbers in my head, but it's like a 60-40 narrow -- maybe 55-45 narrow to wide-body split. That has shifted the same as Boeing and Airbus has shifted over the last 12 months. So to give you a picture on that, I think, traditionally, Boeing would have been 60, Airbus 40, split the other way, and they could rebalance again in 2021, to some degree, as the MAX gets back up and going.
For engines, I actually don't keep the numbers in my head in terms of what the exact split is. Certainly, in terms of what we see over the next 12, 18 months is that the narrow-body engines, so think LEAP-1A, LEAP-1B and then obviously, some of the aftermarket service business coming back, particularly for the CFM engines. So what we see begin to fill in the back end of the year to 2022. But I think that's best I can do at this point. I can't exactly remember the split between wide and narrow for engine and maybe we haven't given it."

Oil and gas has been really very muted for the last year and the first half of this year. But we -- our thought process is that maybe in the fourth quarter or certainly by the first quarter of next year, we think in the oil and gas begins to show an improvement for us. We see Texas crude now at $66, plus or minus, and natural gas has moved up. And rig count has moved up significantly for the Gulf. And so all that's talking well to us in terms of the demand partners we work through inventories in oil and gas.
And then in general, industrial is also strengthening, as we see through the balance of 2021, again, in the second half. So basically, snapshot is IGT is strong. Oil and gas, another quarter or 2 of weakness, followed by some strength, and then general industrial progressively getting better as well."

If you -- to give you a picture, if you go back, 2019 as the reference point, $800 million of spares, which essentially is engine, plus -- on top of that, fasteners and structure business. It was $400 million of defense and industrial that grew, let's say, let's call it, 20% over the last year or so. So healthy growth there.
But for the most part, the spares or parts we sell through to the MRO shops through our customers just dropped off a cliff in the second half of last year. So basically, you see limited demand, but still a demand like commercial business jet and some very modest levels of spares business. And that picture through that is first half of this year is pretty much the same as the back half of last year. So compared to $100 million a quarter, I think, more like $20 million a quarter. It can be below that, could be just above it, just depends on the quarter. It's just bouncing around with small numbers.
In the second half of this year, I think we're expecting a modest lift, but not planning for anything significant in that spares business in the second half at this point, but let's say a little bit higher than that. That's clear compared to the $20 million a quarter, thinking more like that $25 million to $30 million a quarter. It doesn't move the needle for us at this point in time. I think it will in '22.

And so I think that's a fairly thought-through and quality view of the market at this point. I recognize that we do have extended change. So for example, part of our -- if you could just take the North American business, and so I'll just confine my comments to that. Yes, we'll supply directly to Boeing. So that's part of the demand. But we also supply into -- in Spirit. And therefore, it's another step in the supply chain.
And what we're clear at is that we've been supplying at the low rate for some time. We're not trying to be optimistic in saying we're going to see that recover in the Q3 or Q4. We've been saying it's a couple of quarters behind and do think that it will begin to recover or will maybe even -- maybe it's the bullwhip comment that Gautam used or is it snapback. I think we're going to see significant demand increases for our fastener business in 2022.

The cost -- the employment that I'm talking about bringing into the business is essentially in our variable cost structure. So you need to understand it's completely different parts of bucketing in the P&L. And I just consider like direct labor reflect in accordance with the production requirements.
To give you a picture for second quarter, then we're thinking of, let's say, around 400 people, could be 500 people, to bring into the business in -- during April, May and June to prepare ourselves for what we've talked about and recognizing that many of those hours won't be necessarily that productive as we go through.
So you can begin to work out if you just apply an average direct labor cost per employee for that sort of numbers and average them through a quarter. You can see the sort of costs that we're talking about this being there. But I believe that, that's essential for us to be able to then achieve the yields, the incremental margins that we've talked about, which is really what this business is all about and the way we should think about it."

I also plan to talk to ESG, and we'll do so in about once a year going forward. And then provide guidance and talk to guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2021. 
So let's move to Slide #4. Let me start with some commentary on the second quarter, which was the first comparable quarter for Howmet post separation with no pro forma numbers. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations, while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was on par with Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 at 22.8% despite the addition of costs to prepare for the second half ramp-up in commercial aerospace production. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22 and ahead of our expectations. Historically, the first half has been a cash outflow for the company. The increased operating performance focus of Howmet has led to improved margins, enhanced working capital control and capital discipline, which generated $160 million of cash in the first half of the year. We expect continued cash generation in the third and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $835 million by completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes in Q1 and the 2022 notes in Q2 with cash on hand. These transactions reduced 2021 interest expense by approximately $28 million and approximately $47 million on an annual run rate basis. This helps with increased 2022 free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of a $200 million share buyback program. The weighted average acquisition price was $34.02 per share [ or ] approximately 5.9 million shares. The second quarter end cash balance was $716 million. Lastly, we continue to focus on reducing legacy liabilities. Year-to-date, we have reduced our pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $160 million. Moreover, full year pension and OpEx expense is expected to improve approximately 50% compared to last year. 
Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q2 revenue was 5% less year-over-year and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was 31% less driven by lower aircraft builds, spares and the lingering effects of customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by our continued strength in other markets. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 13% year-over-year, driven by new builds and spares. The commercial transportation business was up 89% year-over-year as it rebounds from customer shutdowns in Q2 of 2020. Truck demand remains strong as our customers manage through their own supply chain issues with several components, which are in short supply. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction, margin expansion and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations as they are tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations with the $37 million year-over-year benefit, which reflects the decisive actions we started in the second quarter of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and continued through last year. Year-to-date structural cost reductions are $98 million, which have essentially achieved already our target of approximately $100 million. The aerospace decremental operating margins continue to be very good at only 19%, while the wheels segment had an incremental margin of 47%. EBITDA margin expanded by 310 basis points year-on-year driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost reductions. The team delivered strong margin expansion despite a reduction in revenue. Capital expenditure was $36 million for the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Lastly, free cash flow was $164 million for the quarter, resulting in a record first half. 
Now let's move to Slide 6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8% and consistent with the last couple of quarters on approximately $43 million of less revenue. The margin results overcame both the effects of the low revenue and the cost of many additional employees to meet the increasing production demand coming in the third quarter. Q2 revenue at $1.2 billion was in line with expectations. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic in Q2 with a solid 310 basis points EBITDA margin expansion while revenue was approximately $58 million less in the same period. 
Now let me hand it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets."

And some more details about our year-over-year revenue performance. Second quarter revenue was 5% less driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was 31% less year-over-year, in line with our projections as expected inventory corrections continued. Defense aerospace was essentially flat in the second quarter as we are on a diverse set of programs with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segment, was up 89% year-over-year and second quarter of last year was significantly impacted by customer shutdowns. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 13%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 13% year-over-year. 
I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials."

As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was 7% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% less driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 13% in IGT. The IGT business continues to be strong as demand for cleaner energy continues. Decremental margins for engines were 12% for the quarter as we hired back approximately 300 workers to prepare for the anticipated growth in the second half of this year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental or decremental margins for the quarter. 
Now let's move to Fastening Systems. [indiscernible] Like the Engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in commercial aerospace. The industrial and commercial transportation markets within the Fastening Systems segment were both up approximately 45% year-over-year. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 31% for the second quarter and segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. 
Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 30% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 45% less driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense aerospace was relatively flat year-over-year. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 12% for the quarter. 
Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue doubled year-over-year as last year's results were impacted by customer shutdowns. On a sequential basis, volumes were down approximately 7% due to customer supply chain issues. Reported revenue was essentially flat sequentially, driven by a 20% increase in aluminum prices. Although higher metal costs were passed through to customers to avoid a profit impact, you will see a reduction in EBITDA percent resulting from the pass-through. Segment operating profit margin was approximately 27%, and year-over-year incremental margin was 47%. Improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. 
Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In the first half of the year, we completed the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. Gross debt stands at approximately $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. 
Before turning it back to John to discuss ESG and 2021 guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the second quarter were a net charge of approximately $22 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the early redemption of the 2022 bonds completed in early May. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Moving to ESG. I encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. For Howmet Aerospace, environmental, social and governance is about generating meaningful change for a more sustainable future, improving our diversity and inclusion inside our company and in the communities in which we operate. Regarding employee safety, we are maintaining attention on safety through on certain operational conditions presented by COVID-19. The recordable incidents continue to be significantly better than the aerospace and defense industry average. For 2020, we had a 20% year-over-year improvement in rate to 0.71%. Additionally, 84% of our locations worldwide were without a lost workday incident. This is a tremendous testament to the dedication and focus of our workforce. We continue to underscore the importance and power of diversity, equity and inclusion in our company. We value the rich diversity of expertise, backgrounds and viewpoints that fuel our innovation and we are committed to improving diversity of employees at all levels. Recently, we were recognized by the 50/50 Women on Boards organization for our commitment to board diversity. In addition to gender diversity, we also partnered with key external organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Hispanic Corporate Council and diversity best practices to review and continuously improve initiatives with respect to sustainability. Nowhere is this more evident than in the products that we provide to our customers. Our proprietary technologies help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions contributing to the aerospace industry's goal of a smaller carbon footprint. 
5 specific areas are at the bottom left of the slide. The commercial aerospace next-generation technology reduces fuel consumption by approximately 15%. Moreover, how much increased content on composite aircraft of 2x contributes to lightweighting solutions and reduces fuel use as composite aircraft are approximately 20% more fuel efficient than comparable metallic aircraft. For Forged Wheels, Howmet's aluminum wheels are 5x stronger than steel, while being 47% lighter. Customers can realize up to 1,400 pounds of weight savings from retrofitting an 18-wheeler Class 8 truck of steel to aluminum wheels. For IGT, Howmet's products continue to enable higher operating temperatures in the turbine and also precious, which increased low deficiency towards approximately 64% and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 40%. Lastly, for renewables, Howmet's Fastening Systems used with solar panels, improved strength and clamping by 5x to 10x and reduce installation time by up to 80%. 
Moving to STEM education and inclusiveness. Howmet is dedicated to increasing STEM opportunities in education in the local community through the Howmet Aerospace Foundation with grants to institutions and schools. Also, we renewed our commitment to support our 6 employee resource groups with strategic focus on community, culture and careers. 
Let me now move to Slide 14 for our third quarter and annual guidance. The leading indicators for air travel continued to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. This includes online searches for air tickets, increases in flight schedules across most of the world and beginnings of some international travel. Orders for aircraft by airlines and assembly partners are increasing rapidly. The expectation that Howmet will transition into revenue growth in the third quarter continues with growth of approximately 15% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth of approximately 9%. We look forward to managing and leading this exciting growth phase for Howmet after the devastation of the pandemic on the industry. Growth is expected to continue into Q4 and into 2021 -- sorry, 2022 and beyond. The sequence of our businesses that we expect increases in the engine business, notably starting in the third quarter, followed by structures in the fourth quarter and fastener starting in the first quarter of 2022. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: For the third quarter, revenue of $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million, EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 40 basis points and earnings per share of $0.25, plus or minus $0.02. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million; EBITDA baseline to increase to $1.17 billion, plus or minus, plus $15 million, minus $25 million, EBITDA margin to increase to 22.9% plus 10 basis points and minus -- to minus 20 basis points. Earnings per share increased to $0.99 plus or minus $0.03. Cash flow baseline increased to $450 million, plus or minus $35 million. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 12% versus the first half driven by commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Second half year-over-year incremental margins of over 50% compared to the prior year. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020. The cost reduction carryover of $100 million is already achieved with some potential modest upside. Pensions and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million. We are reducing cash pension contributions by approximately $40 million based upon the American rescue [indiscernible] CapEx should be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion continues to be in excess of net income at approximately 100%. Lastly, as announced last month, we have reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common stock starting in the third quarter. 
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a summary. The second quarter was solid, and it's described as a quarter to get through while we look for the volume lift in the third quarter. Was better than expectations with improved margins and excellent cash flow. The net recruitment of production operators in the second quarter was approximately 300 people, principally in our engine business. And we, of course, will continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. In second half, we plan to recruit another net 500 people. Liquidity is strong, and we have healthy cash generation. The third quarter outlook is for revenue to be approximately $100 million higher than the second quarter, with margins somewhere between 22.3% and 23.1%. For the second half, we expect extra costs. However, year-over-year incremental margins are expected to be over 50%. Consolidated EBITDA margins for the second half are expected to be 22.6% to 23.2%, setting a platform for a healthy 2022. And overcoming the bag of the increased labor costs from the recruitment [indiscernible] of [indiscernible] and of course, the net effect of the metal recoveries.

The majority of the employees that we recruited so far. And in fact, the majority in the third quarter will be for the engine business. So far, about 3/4 of the increase has come from people that we've recalled from previous employment and 1/4 of new employees. I expect that blend to change as we move through the next, let's say, period of time. And maybe to a 50-50 and then the majority will be fresh employees, I think, as we exit the year. To give you a road map for the second half, as -- the first -- Q3 will be principally engine and then we'll be looking to add selectively in our structures business in the fourth quarter and also for our fasteners business as we get looking into 2022 to be ready for that.

So let's talk narrow body in total because I think that's the most important really metric for the next 18 months or so. So in 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 MAX was peaked about 100, maybe fractionally over 100, maybe 1",691,"Okay. So let's talk narrow body in total because I think that's the most important really metric for the next 18 months or so. So in 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 MAX was peaked about 100, maybe fractionally over 100, maybe 105 in a couple of months. And so that would be, say, the prior aggregation of the 2. Clearly, that mix is changing currently with a view that Airbus is moving to, is it 47 in January and then 55 by the middle of the year, while Boeing is still planning to raise production to, I think, just over 30, lets call it 31 in January of '22 and has been silent there afterwards at this point. So the combo total is in the mid-80s and 30 for 2022, might there still a very significant increase on the last year or last -- this year. So the percentage increase is enormous. It still isn't back to '19 levels. And then if it's right by the middle of -- or maybe at the end of '23, we're up in the mid-60s for Airbus. And we don't yet know for Boeing. But you can envisage that we will be right back at that 100 maybe -- it may be even breaking through the 105 barrier on a combined basis at that point in time. And with the potential of further rate increases, should Airbus confirm their aspirations to go to and above. So that's the road map there. But for 18 months, while we're getting to 100, it basically just puts us back in the same territory that we've already been in. And so we have certainly adequate capacity for all of that. If you then obviously have to blend in what's happening with wide-body. And it's probably a little bit too early to say, but I expect probably by the second half of '23 that wide-body will picking up. In fact, I also think that we'll see some benefits as we go into 2022. So for example, should 787 return from -- to 5 a month from its current production level, then that would also be an increase for us. So my expectation is that we'll see, what I call, 3 volume lift, you'll see the lift from us being below current build rate. Just because parts are being taken out of inventory. Then we will go to a rate math situation where we'll sell a ship set of aircraft parts, equipment and aircraft. So that would be volume lift 1. But with volume lift 2, which is the increase that we have to make to continue to pace with the rates that are being talked about. So let's say, Boeing going from 14 to 20 to 31 and from Airbus going from 40 to 55. So those both very healthy increases. And then, of course, for this to be done, then inventory has to be bought back in the system. So I expect that during 2022 and in '23, we're going to see benefits above rate because the inventory just has to be put back into the system to guarantee these levels of aircraft production. So when you put it all back together, and I'll just say, pick a moment in time, so let's pick under '23 and in to '24, then my expectation is that things being equal, will be at a rate of revenue above 2019. And basically, with the content increases that we have or are built in plus any net benefit on price is that on a like-for-like basis, we'd probably be closer to the $7.5 billion to $8 billion on equipment production of aircraft. I mean that's very appropriate but obviously, there's a lot of changing parts amongst all of that as we go through the next 2 or 3 years. But the way I look at it, David, is that we've got 3 years that are pretty significant to look forward to and then maybe by the middle of the decade, relating to the more normal 4% or 5% depending what end market demand is at that time."

In terms of machine tools, we have no problems whatsoever in terms of capacity because we already made, say, 100-plus narrow bodies in 2019. And as you know, we -- certainly in our engine business, we've put [ $0.5 billion ] of investments in place to take that capacity up. And so -- and then, of course, the capacity that just came in, then the pandemic hit us. And so we've carried that capacity for the last, let's say, 18 months now, and therefore, it's still totally available to us. So we -- in terms of machine tool capacity, we could take back to 400-plus narrow-body rate, all the wide-body rate and the significant increase above that. And so in terms of plant and equipment, we have essentially no restrictions whatsoever. And that also gives me confidence that we can still operate for a year or so with capital expenditures being below depreciation because the capacity is essentially already there. 
To get further into your question, though, is that until we know the exact mix of requirements, it's difficult to say on the tooling side. So again, for the next 18 months, I see no problems at all in terms of meeting customer demand. And if we took narrow-bodies, let's say, 105 level combined, then no problems. It's only when we -- if we were to add, let's say, if Airbus were getting to 75 and if Boeing were back above 50, and so we're talking 125 aircraft per month. Then clearly, at that point, we'd be out of balance certainly in terms of tooling or dye capacity for the -- for some of the Airbus parts. And therefore, additional tooling would have to be have -- to be put down to cope with those -- that volume scenario, should it finally be confirmed. So the way I think about it for the next couple of years, we have no capacity limitation apart from the ability to onboard labor and train it effectively to do all of that side of the business but at the software side. But in terms of hard plant and machinery, we're fully capacitized and then we have to be thinking about increasing tool capacity"

So the order intake for Class 8 truck trail has been at an extraordinary level for some time. And so the backlog is truly extraordinary. And so in one sense, the demand is there, such that our confidence over parts of year, in fact, the whole of 2022 for our commercial transportation business is really high. So it's like a great outlook. In fact, I don't think we've ever seen it so strong. The issue that we had in the second quarter was, I would call despite that extraordinary end market demand, we actually were in a position where we did not supply, not because essentially, we were unable to supply, but we took a large amount of down days and it was different by end customer because they were unable to complete assembly of trucks due to missing parts, whether it was missing tires or windshields other structural components or of course, the one that everybody is very familiar with is the issue of electronics and semiconductors. And so we have a lot of partially built trucks that are there, which are in [indiscernible] around the -- both the U.S. and in Europe. And some of those are delivered to dealers with parts missing until they can go back in retrofit. In the -- so what I'm trying to do is picture, the market for us is one where a great end market, but just short-term supply constraints by our customers, parts that couldn't build. And we were taking days down here or there just because [indiscernible] don't shift because we can't build anymore. We got no place to stick them because we haven't got parts. That resulted in a 7% volume reduction for us of delivered end products in Q2 compared to Q1. So let's call it, $18 million worth of revenue volume, which happened to be made up then by the -- by basically repricing for metal. So the metal escalators that we have covered up for the volume shortfall. So essentially, Seth, if you take our -- on a percentage basis, if you take our EBITDA margin of Q1 and divide it by the -- those revenues and you flex it by 18, then you can see that, that totally accounts for about a few hundred basis points of margin impact. So the way you should think about the second quarter for wheels was we had a 7% volume drop and also metals impact. And basically, if you adjust for those 2, actually, the margin is very respectable. And if you want to extrapolate it a little bit further, so we didn't call it out because we tend not to call such things out. In fact, if you were to adjust for that, let's call it, $18 million, $20 million at the Howmet level basically metal pass-through just on wheels alone, then in fact, our EBITDA margins would have been just over 23%. So significant improvement on Q1 on a like-for-like basis, albeit masked by just the fact that the denominator goes up and your numerator goes up because of the way we recover metal. So that walks you through both wheels and for Howmet."

We are planning and scheduling that we will have an increased second half in airfoil aftermarket going through our customers of GE and Pratt & Whitney. So while the percentage I think it's -- I can't remember take that one. But it's certainly well into the double digits and percentage increase. Again, it's not a huge number, but it's pleasing to see that demand. And then all goes well, again, as we exit this year into next year. So when I bifurcated the strength that we saw in Defense and IGT spares has continued all the way through with no real letup on that side at all. I'd say, a fairly strong growth in 2020, in June 2021. But the commercial aerospace business was -- has been very, very muted, certainly in Q1, a small increase in Q2 and we're seeing higher percentage increases, but it doesn't material in dollar terms until 2022."

Our thought is that basically a narrow-body by the end of this year, there is there's no inventory left in the system and we have to be in an individual situation. And it's only isolated pockets because essentially as these rate increases take effect in the second half of this year, that's just chewing up any remaining parts that's available. And also, we always have to see through whether a Tier 1 situation directly to an airframe manufacturer compared to an engine manufacturer to try to [indiscernible] the engine in the system as well. So it's different on wide-body. By the end of the year, and I'm struggling to remember the number, but let's assume it's -- we still have some tracked inventory in the system. And will be carrying, I think, something but now less than about 50 million of trapped inventory in our system, which will liquidate during 2022.

I think will be very little, if any, in our customer systems left for narrow-body as we transition through the end of the year, tightening each quarter."

So we read that maybe luckily we won't be building as quite as many as they had thought. And that happened both last year and it seems to be this year in terms of maybe supply availability or impact the COVID or the workforce, I'm not sure. But I mean, there has been an increase between 2020 and 2021. We are seeing -- well, I think Lockheed is talking about a slightly reduced 2022 compared to their previous forecast. So maybe I would call it 169 down to 159 or something. It's still above 2021. And so we see steady growing F-35 from last year, this year into next year, and then pretty steady for the following couple of years. And for us, if the build were to be reduced by 5% or so, let's say, in '24 or '25, don't know yet. Then that would be when the increase in spares would be occurring pretty engine program. So we expect the spares requirements to become quite significant for that aircraft as we move towards the middle of the decade. And so we probably look at as the F-35 on combined, so early enough aftermarket continues to improve -- increase slightly for Howmet over the next few years. You do note additional orders, whether it's just coming order of 30 [indiscernible] aircraft or even in the proposed defense budget that was actually lifted by, I think, the Senate to have a higher increase in quantity of F-35, that was in the original White House budget. So it's trending fairly well for us at this point in time. 
On the here and now, you also have to pick through the seasonality of the defense orders. They always tend to be a little bit light in the first half of the year, a bit heavy in the second half of the year. And we saw that again significantly in Q4 of last year where the defense demand was filled basically on a use it or lose it from the DoD budget. So when you have to blend through from us, IGT F-35 still in the 40% of total defense sales. If I call it now, I'd say pretty stable year-on-year, maybe with a slight increase in increasing towards the back end of the year. And then we see some healthy signs a bit too early to really define '23 to get some healthy signs for some of the other military programs rotorcraft that we're looking at for that year. So I don't if that's relatively enough for you or?"

And that's both for the new larger blade for the new turbines, which I mentioned in my earlier comments, which we provide gas turbines, which have fundamentally higher output and lower emissions at both [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. And so we have a very strong demand for that and a significant backlog for all of our customers, whether it's GE, [indiscernible] Ansaldo, et cetera. And that's also combined with a very strong aftermarket for our predecessor products. Well, say not as big blade if you want to put it that way and it's still pretty big compared to an aircraft turbine but not as big as the latest fleet of very large gas turbine engine. 
And now the supply situation is easier for us, and we do have very significant demand basically because the natural gas turbines in particular are being worked harder given the relatively attractive, I'll say fuel content of the natural gas compared to oil or coal and in the lower emission mode that they also admit the methane. So a very healthy situation there. Oil and gas, the leading indicators of rig counts are going up very significantly. But we're not currently seeing increasing demand yet. I guess we're in that inventory burn our situation. And therefore, I guess, hope that, that will turn into an increase for us in in 2022. And in general, industrial is also continues to be strong, but not as strong as the IGT market, where really I would say we could just do with more plants and the sort of equipment for these turbine is not fungible to -- from an aircraft."

I'll start with an overview of Howmet's second quarter performance then pass to Tolga, who'll talk more to our markets, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. I also plan to talk to ESG, and we'll do so in about once a year going forward and then provide guidance and talk to guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2021.
So let's move to Slide #4. Let me start with some commentary on the second quarter, which was the first comparable quarter for Howmet post separation with no pro forma numbers. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations, while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was on par with Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 at 22.8% despite the addition of costs to prepare for the second half ramp-up in commercial aerospace production. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22 and ahead of our expectations. 
Historically, the first half has been a cash outflow for the company. The increased operating performance focus of Howmet has led to improved margins, enhanced working capital control and capital discipline, which generated $160 million of cash in the first half of the year. We expect continued cash generation in the third and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $835 million by completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes in Q1 and the 2022 notes in Q2 with cash on hand. These transactions reduced 2021 interest expense by approximately $28 million and approximately $47 million on an annual run rate basis. This helps with increased 2022 free cash flow. 
In the second quarter, we continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of a $200 million share buyback program. The weighted average acquisition price was $34.02 per share for approximately 5.9 million shares. The second quarter end cash balance was $716 million. Lastly, we continue to focus on reducing legacy liabilities. Year-to-date, we have reduced our pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $160 million. Moreover, full year pension and OpEx expense is expected to improve approximately 50% compared to last year.
Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q2 revenue was 5% less year-over-year and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was 31% less, driven by lower aircraft builds, spares and the lingering effects of customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by our continued strength in other markets. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 13% year-over-year, driven by new builds and spares. The commercial transportation business was up 89% year-over-year as it rebounds from customer shutdowns in Q2 of 2020. Truck demand remains strong as our customers manage through their own supply chain issues with several components which are in short supply. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction, margin expansion and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations as they are tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations with a $37 million year-over-year benefit which reflects the decisive actions we started in the second quarter of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and continued through last year. Year-to-date structural cost reductions are $98 million, which have essentially achieved already our target of approximately $100 million. The aerospace decremental operating margins continue to be very good at only 19%, while the Wheels segment had an incremental margin of 47%. EBITDA margin expanded by 310 basis points year-on-year, driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost reductions. The team delivered strong margin expansion despite a reduction in revenue. Capital expenditure was $36 million for the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Lastly, free cash flow was $164 million for the quarter, resulting in a record first half.
Now let's move to Slide 6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8% and consistent with the last couple of quarters on approximately $43 million of less revenue. The margin results overcame both the effects of the low revenue and the cost of many additional employees to meet the increasing production demand coming in the third quarter. Q2 revenue at $1.2 billion was in line with expectations. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic in Q2 with a solid 310 basis points EBITDA margin expansion, while revenue was approximately $58 million less in the same period.
Now let me hand it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets."

Please move to Slide 7 and some more details about our year-over-year revenue performance. Second quarter revenue was 5% less, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was 31% less year-over-year, in line with our projections as expected inventory corrections continued. Defense aerospace was essentially flat in the second quarter as we are on a diverse set of programs with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was up 89% year-over-year as second quarter of last year was significantly impacted by customer shutdowns. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was up 13%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up a healthy 13% year-over-year.
I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials."

As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 7% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% less, driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 13% in IGT. The IGT business continues to be strong as demand for cleaner energy continues. Decremental margins for engines were 12% for the quarter as we hired back approximately 300 workers to prepare for the anticipated growth in the second half of this year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental or decremental margins for the quarter. 
Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 9. Also was expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 20% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 42% less. Like the Engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in commercial aerospace. The industrial and commercial transportation markets within the Fastening Systems segment were both up approximately 45% year-over-year. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 31% for the second quarter, and segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%.
Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 30% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 45% less, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense aerospace was relatively flat year-over-year. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 12% for the quarter.
Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue doubled year-over-year as last year's results were impacted by customer shutdowns. On a sequential basis, volumes were down approximately 7% due to customer supply chain issues. Reported revenue was essentially flat sequentially, driven by a 20% increase in aluminum prices. Although higher metal costs were passed through to customers to avoid a profit impact, you will see a reduction in EBITDA percent resulting from the pass-through. Segment operating profit margin was approximately 27%, and year-over-year incremental margin was 47%. Improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries.
Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In the first half of the year, we completed the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. Gross debt stands at approximately $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Before turning it back to John to discuss ESG and 2021 guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the second quarter were a net charge of approximately $22 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the early redemption of the 2022 bonds completed in early May. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

Moving to ESG, I'd I encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. For Howmet Aerospace, environmental, social and governance is about generating meaningful change for a more sustainable future, improving our diversity and inclusion inside our company and in the communities in which we operate. 
Regarding employee safety, we are maintaining attention on safety through and certain operational conditions presented by COVID-19. Total recordable incidents continue to be significantly better than the aerospace and defense industry average. For 2020, we had a 20% year-over-year improvement in rate to 0.71. Additionally, 84% of our locations worldwide were without a lost workday incident. This is a tremendous testament to the dedication and focus of our workforce. 
We continue to underscore the importance and power of diversity, equity and inclusion in our company. We value the rich diversity of expertise, backgrounds and viewpoints that fuel our innovation, and we are committed to improving diversity of employees at all levels. Recently, we were recognized by the 50/50 Women on Boards organization for our commitment to board diversity. In addition to gender diversity, we also partnered with key external organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Hispanic Corporate Council and Diversity Best Practices, to review and continuously improve our initiatives. 
With respect to sustainability, nowhere is this more evident than in the products that we provide to our customers. Our proprietary technologies help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions contributing to the aerospace industry's goal of a smaller carbon footprint. Five specific areas are at the bottom left of the slide. For commercial aerospace, next-generation jet engine technology reduces fuel consumption by approximately 15%. Moreover, Howmet's increased content on composite aircraft of 2x contributes to lightweighting solutions and reduces fuel use as composite aircraft are approximately 20% more fuel efficient than comparable metallic aircraft. 
For Forged Wheels, Howmet's aluminum wheels are 5x stronger than steel while being 47% lighter. Customers can realize up to 1,400 pounds of weight savings from retrofitting an 18-wheeler Class 8 truck of steel to aluminum wheels. For IGT, Howmet's products continue to enable higher operating temperatures in the turbine and also pressures, which increase the load efficiency towards approximately 64% and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 40%. 
Lastly, for renewables, Howmet's Fastening Systems used with solar panels improve strength and clamping by 5x to 10x and reduce installation time by up to 80%. 
Moving to STEM education and inclusiveness. Howmet is dedicated to increasing STEM opportunities and education in the local community through the Howmet Aerospace Foundation with grants to institutions and schools. Also, we renewed our commitment to support our 6 employee resource groups with strategic focus on community, culture and careers. 
Let me now move to Slide 14 for our third quarter and annual guidance. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. This includes online searches for air tickets, increases in flight schedules across most of the world and beginnings of some international travel. Orders for aircraft by airlines and assembly partners are increasing rapidly. The expectation that Howmet will transition into revenue growth in the third quarter continues with growth of approximately 15% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth of approximately 9%. We look forward to managing and leading this exciting growth phase for Howmet after the devastation of the pandemic on the industry. Growth is expected to continue into Q4 and into 2021 -- sorry, 2022 and beyond. The sequence of our business is that we expect increases in the Engine business, notably starting in the third quarter, followed by Structures in the fourth quarter; and Fastener, starting in the first quarter of 2022. 
In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: for the third quarter, revenue of $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million; EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $10 million; EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 40 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.25, plus or minus $0.02. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million; EBITDA baseline to increase to $1.17 billion, plus or minus -- plus $15 million, minus $25 million; EBITDA margin to increase to 22.9%, plus 10 basis points and minus 20 basis points; earnings per share increase to $0.99, plus or minus $0.03; cash flow baseline increase to $450 million, plus or minus $35 million. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: second half revenue to be up approximately 12% versus the first half, driven by commercial aerospace, defense and IGT; second half year-over-year incremental margins of over 50% compared to the prior year. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020. The cost reduction carryover of $100 million is already achieved with some potential modest upside. Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million. We are reducing cash pension contributions by approximately $40 million based upon the American Rescue Plan Act. CapEx should be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion continues to be in excess of net income at approximately 100%. Lastly, as announced last month, we have reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common stock, starting in the third quarter. 
Now let's move to Slide 15 for a summary. The second quarter was solid, and it's described as a quarter to get through while we look for the volume lift in the third quarter. It was better than expectations with improved margins and excellent cash flow. The net recruitment of production operators in the second quarter was approximately 300 people, principally in our Engine business. And we, of course, will continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. In the second half, we plan to recruit another net 500 people. 
Liquidity is strong, and we have healthy cash generation. The third quarter outlook is for revenue to be approximately $100 million higher than the second quarter with margins somewhere between 22.3% and 23.1%. For the second half, we expect extra costs. However, year-over-year incremental margins are expected to be over 50%. Consolidated EBITDA margins for the second half are expected to be 22.6% to 23.2%, setting a platform for a healthy 2022 And overcoming the drag of the increased labor costs from the recruitment I talked about and the cost of net -- the net effect of the metal recoveries. 
Thank you very much, and we'll take your questions."

We mentioned that we would possibly recruit 400 to 500 people in the second quarter, so we're a little bit below that. And that was essentially us keeping tight control of the cost going forward. The majority of the employees that we've recruited so far, and in fact, the majority in the third quarter will be for the Engine business. So far, about 3/4 of the increase has come from people that we've recalled from previous employment and 1/4 of new employees. I expect that blend to change as we move through the next, let's say, period of time and maybe do a 50-50, and then the majority will be fresh employees, I think, as we exit the year. 
To give you a road map for the second half as a -- first -- Q3 will be principally Engine, and then we'll be looking to add selectively in our Structures business in the fourth quarter and also for our Fasteners business as we get looking into 2022 to be ready for that.

416264458,1673918824,2363115,"Howmet Aerospace Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Howmet Aerospace Inc.","Executives","Okay. So let's talk narrow-body in total because I think that's the most important really metric for the next 18 months or so. So in 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 MAX was peaked at about 100, maybe fractionally over 100, mayb",700,"Okay. So let's talk narrow-body in total because I think that's the most important really metric for the next 18 months or so. So in 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 MAX was peaked at about 100, maybe fractionally over 100, maybe 105 in a couple of months. And so that would be, say, the prior aggregation of the 2. 
Clearly, that mix is changing currently with the view that Airbus is moving to -- is it 47 in January and then 55 by the middle of the year, while, let's say, Boeing is still planning to raise production to, I think, just over 30, lets call it 31 in January of '22 and has been silent there afterwards at this point. So the combo total is in the mid-80s. And so you can see for 2022 might there still a very significant increase on the last year or last -- in this year, so the percentage increase is enormous. It still isn't back to '19 levels. 
And then if it's right by the middle of -- or maybe at the end of '23, we're up in the mid-60s for Airbus. And we don't yet know for Boeing. But you can envisage that we will be right back at 100 maybe -- and maybe even breaking through the 105 barrier on a combined basis at that point in time and with the potential further rate increases, should Airbus confirm their aspirations to go to 70 and above. So that's the road map there. 
But for 18 months, while we're getting to 100, it basically just puts us back in the same territory that we've already been in. And so we have certainly adequate capacity for all of that. If you then obviously have to blend in what's happening with wide-body, it's probably a little bit too early to say, but I expect probably by the second half of '23 that wide-body will be picking up. In fact, I also think that we'll see some benefits as we go into 2022. So for example, should 787 return from -- to 5 a month from its current production level, then that would also be an increase for us. So my expectation is that we'll see, what I call, 3-volume lift. You'll see the lift from us being below current build rate, just because parts are being taken out of inventory. Then we also will go through a rate map situation where we'll sell a ship set of aircraft parts, equipment to an aircraft. So that will be volume lift 1. 
We're then going to see volume lift 2, which is the increase that we have to make to continue to pace with the rates that are being talked about. So let's say Boeing going from 14 to 20 to 31 and from Airbus going from 40 to 55. So those, both, very healthy increases. 
And then, of course, for this to be done, then inventory has to be bought back in the system. So I expect that during 2022 and into 2023, we're going to see benefits above rate because the inventory just has to be put back into the system to guarantee these levels of aircraft production. 
So when you put it all back together, and I'll just say pick a moment in time, so let's pick calendar '23 into '24, then my expectation is that, all things being equal, we will be at a rate of revenue above 2019. And basically, with the content increases that we have or are built in, plus any net benefit on price is that on a like-for-like basis, we'd probably be closer to the $7.5 billion to $8 billion on equipment production of aircraft. I mean that's very approximately. But obviously, there's a lot of changing parts amongst all of that as we go through the next 2 or 3 years. 
But the way I look at it, David, is that we've got 3 years of pretty significant growth to look forward to. And then maybe by the middle of the decade reverting to the more normal 4% or 5%, depending what end market demand is at that time."

In terms of machine tools, we have no problems whatsoever in terms of capacity because we'd already made, let's say, 100-plus narrow-bodies in 2019. And as you know, we -- certainly in our Engine business, we've put $0.5 billion of investments in place to take that capacity up. And so -- and then, of course, the capacity just came in, then the pandemic hit us. And so we've carried that capacity for the last, let's say, 18 months now. And therefore, it's still totally available to us. So we -- in terms of machine tool capacity, we could take back to 400-plus narrow-body rate, all the wide-body rate and the significant increase above that. And so in terms of plant and equipment, we have essentially no restrictions whatsoever. And that also gives me confidence that we can still operate for a year or so with capital expenditures being below depreciation because the capacity is essentially already there.
To get further into your question, though, is that until we know the exact mix of requirements, it's difficult to say on the tooling side. So again, for the next 18 months, I see no problems at all in terms of meeting customer demand. And if we took narrow-bodies, let's say, 105, level combined, then no problems. It's only when we -- if we were to add -- let's say if Airbus were getting to 75 and if Boeing were back above 50 and so we're talking 125 aircraft per month, then, clearly, at that point, we'd be at a balance, certainly, in terms of tooling or die capacity for the -- for some of the Airbus parts. And therefore, additional tooling would have to be -- have to be put down to cope with those -- that volume scenario, should it finally be confirmed. 
So the way I think about it for the next couple of years, we have no capacity limitations, apart from the ability to onboard labor and train it effectively to do all of that side of the business, the softer side. But in terms of hard plant and machinery, we're fully capacitized, and then we have to be thinking about increasing tool capacity."

So let me break it down between fundamental end-market demand and then the demand that we saw. So the order intake for Class 8 truck and trailer has been at an extraordinary level for some time, and so the backlog is truly extraordinary. And so in on",559,"Yes. So let me break it down between fundamental end-market demand and then the demand that we saw. So the order intake for Class 8 truck and trailer has been at an extraordinary level for some time, and so the backlog is truly extraordinary. And so in one sense, the demand is there, such that our confidence over balance of year, in fact, the whole of 2022 for our commercial transportation business is really high. So it's like a great outlook. In fact, I don't think we've ever seen it so strong. 
The issue that we had in the second quarter was, I will call, despite that extraordinary end-market demand, we actually were in a position where we did not supply, not because essentially we were unable to supply, but we took a large amount of down days. And it was different by end customer because they were unable to complete assembly of trucks due to missing parts, whether it was missing tires or windshields, other structural components or of course the one that everybody is very familiar with is the issue of electronics and semiconductors. And so we have a lot of partially built trucks that are there, which are in, I'd say, in fields around the -- both the U.S. and in Europe. And even some of those are delivered to dealers with parts missing until they can go back in retrofit them.
So in the -- so what I'm trying to do is picture -- the market for us is one where great end market but just short-term supply constraints by our customers, couldn't get parts. They couldn't build. And we were taking days down here or there, just because they don't shift because we can't build anymore. We got no place to stick them because we haven't got parts. That resulted in a 7% volume reduction for us. Delivered end product in Q2 compared to Q1, so let's call it $18 million worth of revenue volume, which happened to be made up then by the -- by basically repricing for metal, so the metal escalators that we have covered up for the volume shortfall. 
So essentially, Seth, if you take our -- on a percentage basis, if you take our EBITDA margin of Q1 and divide it by the -- let's say those revenues and you flex it by 18, then you can see that, that totally accounts for about a few hundred basis points of margin impact. So the way you should think about the second quarter for Wheels was we had a 7% volume drop and also metals impact. And basically, if you adjust for those 2, actually, the margin is very respectable. 
And if you want to extrapolate it a little bit further, so we didn't call it out because we tend not to call such things out. In fact, if you were to adjust for that, let's call it, $18 million, $20 million at the Howmet level of basically metal pass-through, just on Wheels alone, then, in fact, our EBITDA margins would have been just over 23%. So significant improvement on Q1 on a like-for-like basis, albeit masked by just the fact that the denominator goes up, and your numerator goes up because of the way we recover metal. So I hope that walked you through both Wheels and for Howmet."

That would be my thought there, just because the part shortages haven't really eased yet. And I do think that we're going to see, as best as I can guess, that some of those will begin to ease towards the back end of the year. So I'm hoping for a fairly robust fourth quarter on Wheels, at least I hope is not a strategy. But the answer is my thought is that it should be getting better and then like a really good 2022 because I say the order book is there. The backlog is just increasing, just because the demand is there, but it's the inability for truck manufacturers to satisfy the market at the moment."

But in the context of Howmet, nothing material at all. We are planning and scheduling that we will have an increased second half in airfoil aftermarket, going through our customers of, let's say, GE and Pratt & Whitney. So while the percentage I think is -- it's -- I can't remember the exact number. It's certainly well into the double digits and percentage increase. Again, it's not huge numbers, but it's pleasing to see that demand. And then all goes well, again, as we exit this year into next year.
So when I bifurcated the strength that we saw in defense and IGT spares has continued all the way through with no real letup on that side at all, and so I'd say a fairly strong growth in 2020 into 2021. But the commercial aerospace business was -- has been very, very muted, certainly in Q1, small increase in Q2, and we're seeing higher percentage increases. But it doesn't become material in dollar terms until 2022."

And also, to some degree, it also depends now, as we go forward, the safety stock that our customers would also like to carry. 
Our thought is that basically a narrow-body by the end of this year, there is no inventory left in the system. And we have to be in an inventory build situation. And it's only isolated pockets because, essentially, as these rate increases take effect in the second half of this year, that's just chewing up any remaining parts that's available. 
And also, we always have to see through whether we're doing a Tier 1 situation directly to an airframe manufacturer compared to an engine manufacturer to try to -- at least that's what -- the engine -- the system as well. 
So it's different on wide-body. By the end of the year, and I'm struggling to remember the number. But let's assume it's -- we still have some trapped inventory in the system, and we'll be carrying, I think, something but now less than about 50 million of trapped inventory in our system which will liquidate during 2022. 
But for narrow-body, the way to think about it, essentially, there's no trapped inventory in our system left. I think there will be very little, if any, in our customer systems left for narrow-body as we transition through the year with tightening each quarter."

So I think a broader perspective is better on defense, and then we sort of kaleidoscope it right back into the here and now. So we read that maybe Lockheed won't be building as quite as many as they had thought, and that happened both last year and seems to be this year in terms of maybe supply availability or impact of COVID on the workforce, I'm not sure. But I mean, there has been an increase between 2020 and 2021. We are seeing -- well, I think Lockheed is talking about a slightly reduced 2022 compared to their previous forecast, so maybe I would call it 169 down to 159 or something. It's still above 2021. 
And so we see steady growing F-35s from last year, this year into next year and then pretty steady the following couple of years. And for us, if the build were to be reduced by 5% or so, let's say, in '24 or '25, don't know yet, then that would be when the increase in spares would be [ occurring pretty ] for our engine program. So we expect the spares requirements to become quite significant for that aircraft as we move towards the middle of the decade. And so we probably look at as the F-35 on a combined, so OE and aftermarket continues to improve, increase slightly for Howmet over the next few years. 
You do note additional orders, whether it's with -- just coming with an order of 36 aircraft or even in the proposed defense budget that was actually lifted by, I think, the Senate to have a slightly higher increase in quantity of F-35s than was in the original White House budget. So it's trending fairly well for us at this point in time.
On the here and now, you also have to pick through the seasonality of defense orders. They always tend to be a little bit light in the first half of the year, a bit heavy in the second half of the year. And we saw that again significantly in Q4 of last year where the defense demand was filled basically on a use it or lose it from the DoD budget. 
So when you have to blend through from us, if the F-35 is still in the 40% of total defense sales, if I call it now, I'd say pretty stable year-on-year, maybe a slight increase and increasing towards the back end of the year. And then we see some healthy signs, albeit too early to really define 2022 yet. Some healthy signs for some of the other military programs, such as the rotorcraft, that we're looking at for that year. So I don't know if that's relatively enough for you or you still need..."

The IGT part of the business is very strong, and we're in a situation where we actually just can't make enough at this point in time. And therefore, essentially, it's on us just to make more. And that's both for the new larger blades for the new turbines, which I've mentioned in my earlier comments, which would provide gas turbines which have fundamentally higher output and lower emissions of both carbon and nitrogen oxide. And so we have a very strong demand for that and a significant backlog for all our customers, whether it's GE [indiscernible], et cetera. And that's also combined with a very strong aftermarket for, I'll call, predecessor products, not -- well, I'd say not as big blades, if you want to put it that way, but it's still pretty big compared to an aircraft turbine but not as big as the major fleet of very large gas turbine engine.
And now the supply situation is easier for us, and we do have very significant demand basically because the natural gas turbines, in particular, are being worked harder given the relatively attractive, I'll say, input fuel content of the natural gas compared to oil or coal and certainly lower emission mode that they also emit the methane, so a very healthy situation there. 
Oil and gas, the leading indicators of rig counts are going up very significantly, but we're not currently seeing increasing demand yet. I guess we're in that inventory burn-off situation. And therefore, I guess, hope that, that will turn into an increase for us in in 2022. And in general, industrial is -- also continues to be strong, but not as strong as the IGT market, where, really, I will say we could just do with, I'd say, more -- so it's more plants and the sort of equipment for these turbine is not fungible to see from an aircraft."

In terms of underlying profitability, very similar, but I'd give the edge to wide-body as being slightly more profitable. Obviously, different volume variety situation, but wide-body will be a little bit more profitable but nothing that knocks the whole company out of joints. 
And if you were to have the extremes that we're facing at the moment,in terms of differentiability, narrow and wide, I'd be surprised if it made more than 1% difference on our margin as you look at it in aggregate, if there are. So it's not -- nothing of great note and fully taken account of in any of the, I'll say, forward looking that we haven't given you a '22 year is that -- the way we've called out the second half is that we see margins improving.

Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITD",843,"Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. We'll move quickly through the slides and then get to your questions. 
First, let's summarize the headline numbers, starting on Slide #4. Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITDA margin was 22.8%. Each number was within the guidance range provided. More importantly, year-over-year revenues increased for the first time. The revenue was led by Commercial Aerospace, up 15% year-over-year, and contributing to a total increase of 13%. Of note, the Howmet segment leading the increase was engine products as previously forecasted. 
The company was also able to overcome the challenges once again of the Boeing 787 build rate declines and the supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production, the 787 affecting Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures in particular. Aluminum prices continued their upward surge with aluminum and regional premiums increasing by over $400 per metric ton sequentially and impacting the margin rate by 20 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.27, and cash generated in the quarter was $115 million. AR securitization was unchanged at $250 million. On a sequential basis, Third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 7% and adjusted earnings per share up 23%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $115 million, which results in a Q3 year-to-date free cash flow at a record $275 million. Ken will provide further details of our debt actions in the quarter, which included a bond tender refi -- finance to fundamentally lower interest costs and thereby improve future free cash flow yield. The combination of debt actions in the third quarter, combined with our first half results and actions, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $70 million. 
In the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 770,000 shares of common stock for $25 million, which increases share repurchases year-to-date to approximately 7 million shares for $225 million. The net result of all these actions plus the reinstatement of the common stock dividend and the $115 million cash inflow resulted in a cash balance of $726 million, similar to that at the end of Q2. Lastly, we continue to focus on legacy liabilities and have reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $180 million year-to-date. Moreover, year-to-date pension and OPEB expense have reduced by approximately 50% compared to last year. 
Please move to Slide #5. Revenue for the quarter increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Commercial Aerospace was up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and narrow-body aircraft production. Commercial Transportation, namely Wheels, was up 38% year-over-year. Volume was impacted by supply chain constraints, limiting the commercial truck production. The volume reduction in the Wheels business was offset by metal recovery dollars. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven by new builds and spares. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by reductions in the Joint Strike Fighter build, but was up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions have exceeded our annual target of $100 million. Q3 structural cost reductions were $23 million year-over-year and $121 million year-to-date. Every segment achieved a strong year-on-year margin expansion as revenue increased for the first time in the year in aggregate. 
In the third quarter, Engine Products had an incremental operating margin of approximately 70%, and Forged Wheels had an incremental operating margin of approximately 45%. Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures both had a higher EBITDA and lower revenue. Fasteners had an operating margin expansion of some 630 basis points, while structures was up 210 basis points. As a result, Howmet's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a full 800 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume, price and structural cost reductions. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million and year-to-date $275 million. And as I said previously, AR securitization is unchanged from the start of the year. Lastly, we have lowered our annualized interest cost by $70 million through a combination of paying down debt and refinancing into lower cost debt. 
Please move to Slide #6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8%, representing an 800 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2020. The margin for the third quarter was consistent with the last few quarters, despite the cost of adding employees to meet the increasing production demand and the effect on margins of the higher aluminum prices. In the quarter, Engine Products added approximately 500 employees net, which now brings the total to 800 net additional employees hired for that segment during the second and third quarters. We continue to review the headcount required in our other segments to adjust for future demand requirements. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken for further details on revenue by market and the detailed financials."

Third quarter total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 42% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of pre-COVID levels of 60%. The third quarter marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery, with commercial aerospace revenue up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter and up 3% sequentially. 
Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 38% year-over-year, however, flat sequentially after we adjust for the increase in aluminum prices. Finally, the Industrial and Other Markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 14% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. 
Let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 24% higher in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 50% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. IGT was 26% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense Aerospace was down 8% year-over-year, but up 7% sequentially. Incremental margins for Engine Products were approximately 70% for the quarter despite hiring back approximately 500 workers to prepare for future growth. Operating margin improved 1,200 basis points year-over-year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental margins for the quarter. 
Please move to Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 6% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 25% lower as we saw continued production declines for the Boeing 787 and customer inventory corrections. The commercial transportation and industrial markets within the Fastening Systems segments were approximately 55% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Year-over-year Fastening Systems was able to generate $14 million more in operating profit, while revenue declined $17 million. As a result, operating margin improved 630 basis points. 
Please move to Slide 10. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 13% higher as the narrow-body recovery was partially offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was down 21% year-over-year but was flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engineered Structures was able to generate $4 million more in operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 210 basis points. 
Finally, please move to Slide 11. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 34% higher in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. The segment was able to overcome a 4% decrease in volume due to customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production, and a 13% increase in aluminum prices to maintain a healthy operating margin of approximately 27%. Year-over-year incremental margins for Forged Wheels were approximately 45% for the quarter. Improved margins were driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. 
Now let's move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. I would highlight 3 actions. First, in the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $835 million of debt by completing the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $47 million. Second, in the third quarter we tendered $600 million of our 6.875% notes due in 2025 and issued $700 million of 3% notes due in 2029. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $20 million. Third, with cash on hand, we repurchased $100 million of our 2021 notes through an open market repurchase in Q3 and in October, which neutralized the gross debt impact of the tender and refinancing. The annualized interest expense saving with this action is approximately $5 million. 
As a result of these actions, we have lowered annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million and smoothed out our future debt maturities. At the end of Q3, gross debt was approximately $4.2 billion, which is similar to Q2. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 3.5x in Q2 to 3.2x despite the deployment of cash for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. 
Before turning it back to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items for the quarter. Special items for the third quarter were a net charge of approximately $93 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the bond tender and refinancing completed in the quarter. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel.

The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. But also we note the sort of revised requirements or restrictions being lifted for certainly transatlantic travel starting this month. As expected, Howmet transitioned to revenue growth in the third quarter, and we expect year-over-year revenue growth will continue into the fourth quarter and to 2022, with a growth of approximately 12% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 6%. Growth is expected to continue in 2022. 
As expected, the Engine Products business began to grow notably in the third quarter. We expect modest sequential growth in Q4 for Engineered Structures despite continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022. 
In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: In terms of guidance for Q4, I'll just call out the midpoints, as you can read the slide: Revenue of $1.315 billion; EBITDA, $300 million; EBITDA margin, 22.8%; earnings per share of $0.29. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5 billion, plus or minus; EBITDA at $1.135 billion; EBITDA margin at 22.7%; earnings per share increased to $1 per share; and cash flow of $450 million. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 8% versus the first half driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and ITT; Q4 sequential segment incremental operating margins, we expect to be in the order of 28%. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020, the cost-reduction carryover of $100 million, as already commented, is exceeded. Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million and CapEx should be in the range of $180 million to $200 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. 
Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income continues to be approximately 100%. I'd now like to preview some initial thoughts regarding 2022. An early approximate total revenue guide would be for an increase in annual revenues of 12% to 15%, led by recovery in Commercial Aerospace. In aggregate, our current view is that we see an acceleration during the course of the year, following a fairly flat first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of this year, except for increased revenues due to metal recovery. We'll refine this view and provide guidance at our earnings call in February 2022. 
Now let's move to Slide 14 for the summary. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, which was in line with guidance. Growth was very healthy, year-on-year and sequentially. Incrementals were truly exceptional, and the company's margin is in the top decile in aerospace. Q3 started -- or marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery. Moreover, we delivered sequential improvements in both EBITDA and earnings per share. We'll continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. Liquidity is strong, and we have very healthy cash generation. The 
fourth quarter for our revenue outlook is $30 million higher than the third quarter, with margins of approximately 23%, which sets a platform for a healthy 2022. Adjusted earnings per share guidance was increased, reflecting lower interest costs.

So first of all, original expectation, if you went back 6 months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month. Clearly, with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. As far as we can see, Boeing in a 0",387,"Okay. So first of all, original expectation, if you went back 6 months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month. Clearly, with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. 
As far as we can see, Boeing in a 0 build condition for 90 days. And while they've adjusted the rate for the fourth quarter to 2, my thought has been it's been a 0 build and then it will be built at -- that may be 4 a month to 2 average that 2. I don't really know, there's some speculation that maybe have built to 2, but it's pretty opaque to us. 
The most important factor is when does recertification occur because whether they build or don't build, it's going to come out of inventory. And we've seen inventories drop as well. And so suppliers into the 787 have been low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the fourth quarter. 
And then the question is what will the rate be in 2022. our thought at this point is that maybe a 2022 annual build might be 48 aircraft, I don't know. We've had to make some guesstimates, and that's provided for in that 12% to 15% volume increase that I talked about in revenues as an initial thought for 2022. And that takes account of what we think the balance of probability is across all of the end markets that we serve. 
And maybe I'll just continue a bit first to give a better color is when you consider the overall uncertainty in the industry regarding liquidation of inventories and in particular, the -- in wide-body, and the fact that it will probably be flat for a further 12 months, the supply chain issues, which are certainly very newsworthy but are real. And indeed caused the truck production to be lower in the third quarter, that's also combined with the annual shutdowns in Europe. 
And then, of course, this -- I'm going to call 0 build condition or is it only 2 on the 787. Then I think the sequential growth is outstanding. And all we're doing is not debating the fact of recovery, but what's the exact angle of the slope of recovery. And that's about it really, Rob."

I think that the -- the growth is a little bit higher than the third quarter. I think it would be similar for fourth. And then depending on 787, I could see some inventory correction in the first quarter. I don't know enough yet to really know. 
In terms of defense, of course, we all know that there's a little bit of seasonality to that, where we do get a second half lift generally, which is a little bit of payback in the first quarter or a use it or lose it basis for defense budgets for spares in particular. Defense for next year, I'm guessing at this point that I'm not going to get too far to '22. But I'll say, fairly flat, if anything, given what Raytheon said about the rate reduction in engine that they see on the, let's say, the original equipment build side. Then that will be fairly muted for us. And then maybe there'll be some pickup on the spare side. So it's difficult to really know there. And then the question is, to what degree we'll see level loading from Lockheed on the overall business. 
So best guess is at the moment, I'd say we shouldn't be anticipating too much by way of defense growth next year. but we should be expecting good growth in terms of the narrow-body commercial aircraft production and then continuing growth in IGT. And also we do anticipate some of these supply chain constraints will be affecting the commercial truck business to move away certainly by the second half of the year. It's all contained in that 12 to 15 best guess. And I don't want to call it a best guess rather than a guide at this point."

So EBITDA margins are somewhat affected in the Wheels business because of the aluminum pass-through. But in the commercial aerospace business, we don't see a similar impact, even though the metal prices have been very high, and I'm sure the other metal prices also went up. Is it because just that metal price is a much smaller component in Aerospace? Or is there some difference in how revenues recorded in the 2 businesses?"

So for example, you don't hear me talking about bad weather in Texas. You don't hear me talking about a particular press going down, why not talk too much about labor and this sort of stuff. It's just we work off, just normal course of business. 
And indeed, for the for margins, if you look at nickel, cobalt, all of these metals into our aerospace segments have also had very significant increases. It has aluminum into some of the bulk end in our structures business, some elements of titanium, although titanium has been pretty muted in aggregate. 
So I just look at all of those things and say, I tend not to call out much. It's just that I think it was on the last call where it was Seth from JPM that was asking specifically about Wheels and the margin, and it's very noticeable for that segment. And so I had to comment about it. And basically, this quarter is exactly the same. So there's a metal impact. 
So last quarter, it was like at the company level, so I don't really get into it at the segment level, it was 30 basis points. And this quarter, it's about 20 basis points of impact. And I just called it out for the -- for that Wheels segment. And obviously, I wanted to I'd be saying to you things like, well, 22.8 really is 23. And if I added a bit more on for aerospace, it's higher than that. But it's like I don't think it's worthy. And so just don't comment, just move on.  
Our job is to manage these things. And one day when metal begins to abate and goes the other way, maybe I won't be calling it out when things are really good either. So that's about it. But if you want to, use 20 or 30 basis points for aluminum impact on the total holdco for Howmet year-to-date."

I want to be a little bit more cautious today. And essentially, I'm going to hang it all on 787 because, as I said earlier, I don't know exactly what the build, but then neither does anybody seem to know the exact build. And so my assumption is that it's less likely that it will be back at rate 5 in January. And so based upon that, I'm going to say it's more like a Q2 effect. 
But again, you tell me 787, I'll tell you what fasteners does because it's significant in the life of that business. My assumption is the rest is pretty flat, wide-body, by improving on narrowbody. So it's really difficult to be precise on any of this at this point in time. That's why all I know is that recovery is occurring, revenues are going up. And the only thing we were really debating here is just what exactly is the angle, that requires us to make a judgment around labor inputs. The rest just falls into place when we know the angle will be upswing. 
And so I just think that's -- let's not get too wrapped around on a minute. The answer is good things are occurring a lot of moving parts, but generally, things are looking positive."

And so bit by bit, they do get resolved capacities, broad supply chains ironed out, people come back to work and vaccination rates go up, and so labor availability, let's say, in Malaysia gets better, and so on. 
So the end market demand for commercial trucks is slightly really high. And so this quarter, what we saw was that some of our major customers have actually -- I'm going to say, given up trying to build on 3 shifts and having it and build aren't off every few days. It's so, I call it our customers completely abandoned its third shift. 
I just accepted that for the next for -- let's say, the balance of year, they're going to just operate on 2 shifts, reassess again in '22.

So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension and OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. And you",354,"No. The only thing that I would add to that is just the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB side. So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension and OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. 
And you saw in the materials here, what we've been doing on pension and OPEB this year and that always benefits next year. But just a couple of items, if I start first with the balance sheet side of the equation, the liability has gone down around $180 million for pension and OPEB. That's significant. That's a combination of company actions that we've taken, as well as the asset returns that we had last year that flow into 2021 and then our contributions. 
But the little known fact as well is we have been spending a lot of time to reduce our gross liability for the pension. Last year, you saw us move around $320 million, either annuitizing or buying out certain programs. We intend to continue that this year, probably another $230 million of gross liability reduction in our gross liability. So that will help us out. 
And then we're also assuming everything right now, all these numbers that discount rates stay where they're at. If we looked at where discount rates finished last year, it was about 2.5%. And if you snap the line today, it would be about 2.8%, so a 30 basis point improvement, that's going to help. We've shared our sensitivity in the past, about a 25 basis point improvement, improves our position by about $90 million. So hopefully, that stays where it's at. 
But definitely doing a lot of work on the balance sheet side. You see how that flows into the P&L. Our pension and OPEB expenses this year, year-to-date, are about $12 million. It's a 50% reduction to where we were from last year. But not only P&L, but as we talked about, that will all help us out from the cash contribution side next year. So we anticipate, as we mentioned, to be lower than $120 million."

Good morning, and welcome to the call. We'll move quickly through the slides and then get to your questions. First, let's summarize the headline numbers, starting on Slide #4. Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITD",841,"Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. We'll move quickly through the slides and then get to your questions. 
First, let's summarize the headline numbers, starting on Slide #4. Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITDA margin was 22.8%. Each number was within the guidance range provided. More importantly, year-over-year revenues increased for the first time. The revenue was led by Commercial Aerospace, up 15% year-over-year, and contributing to a total increase of 13%. Of note, the Howmet segment leading the increase was Engine Products as previously forecasted. 
The company was also able to overcome the challenges once again of the Boeing 787 build rate declines and the supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production, the 787 affecting Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures in particular. Aluminum prices continued the upward surge with aluminum and regional premiums increasing by over $400 per metric ton sequentially and impacting the margin rate by 20 basis points.  
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.27, and cash generated in the quarter was $115 million. AR securitization was unchanged at $250 million. On a sequential basis, Third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 7% and adjusted earnings per share up 23%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $115 million, which results in a Q3 year-to-date free cash flow at a record $275 million. Ken will provide further details of our debt actions in the quarter, which included a bond tender refi finance to fundamentally lower interest costs and thereby improve future free cash flow yield. The combination of debt actions in the third quarter, combined with our first half results and actions, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $70 million. 
In the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 770,000 shares of common stock for $25 million, which increases share repurchases year-to-date to approximately 7 million shares for $225 million. The net result of all these actions plus the reinstatement of the common stock dividend and the $115 million cash inflow resulted in a cash balance of $726 million, similar to that at the end of Q2. 
Lastly, we continue to focus on legacy liabilities and have reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $180 million year-to-date. Moreover, year-to-date pension and OPEB expenses have reduced by approximately 50% compared to last year. 
Please move to Slide #5. Revenue for the quarter increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Commercial Aerospace was up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and narrow-body aircraft production. commercial transportation, namely Wheels, was up 38% year-over-year. 
Volume was impacted by supply chain constraints, limiting the Commercial Truck production. The volume reduction in the Wheels business was offset by metal recovery dollars. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven by new builds and spares. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by reductions in the Joint Strike Fighter builds, but was up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions have exceeded our annual target of $100 million. Q3 structural cost reductions were $23 million year-over-year and $121 million year-to-date. Every segment achieved a strong year-on-year margin expansion as revenue increased for the first time in the year in aggregate.
In the third quarter, Engine Products had an incremental operating margin of approximately 70%, and Forged Wheels had an incremental operating margin of approximately 45%. Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures both had a higher EBITDA on lower revenue. Fasteners had an operating margin expansion of some 630 basis points, while structures was up 210 basis points. As a result, Howmet's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a full 800 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume, price and structural cost reductions. 
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million and year-to-date, $275 million. And as I said previously, AR securitization is unchanged from the start of the year. Lastly, we have lowered our annualized interest cost by $70 million through a combination of paying down debt and refinancing into low-cost debt.  
Please move to Slide #6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8%, representing an 800 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2020. The margin for the third quarter was consistent with the last few quarters, despite the cost of adding employees to meet the increasing production demand and the effect on margins of the higher aluminum prices. 
In the quarter, Engine Products added approximately 500 employees net, which now brings the total to 800 net additional employees hired for that segment during the second and third quarters. We continue to review the headcount required in our other segments to adjust for future demand requirements. 
Now let me turn it over to Ken for further details on revenue by market and the detailed financials."

Third quarter total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 42% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of pre-COVID levels of 60%. The third quarter marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery, with commercial aerospace revenue up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter and up 3% sequentially.  
Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 38% year-over-year, however, flat sequentially after we adjust for the increase in aluminum prices. Finally, the Industrial and Other Markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 14% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. 
Let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 24% higher in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 50% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. IGT was 26% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense Aerospace was down 8% year-over-year, but up 7% sequentially. 
Incremental margins for Engine Products were approximately 70% for the quarter despite hiring back approximately 500 workers to prepare for future growth. Operating margin improved 1,200 basis points year-over-year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental margins for the quarter.  
Please move to Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 6% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 25% lower as we saw continued production declines for the Boeing 787 and customer inventory corrections. The commercial transportation and industrial markets within the Fastening Systems segments were approximately 55% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Year-over-year Fastening Systems was able to generate $14 million more in operating profit, while revenue declined $17 million. As a result, operating margin improved 630 basis points.    
Please move to Slide 10. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 13% higher as the narrow-body recovery was partially offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was down 21% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engineered Structures was able to generate $4 million more in operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 210 basis points. 
Finally, please move to Slide 11. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 34% higher in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. The segment was able to overcome a 4% decrease in volume due to customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production, and a 13% increase in aluminum prices to maintain a healthy operating margin of approximately 27%. Year-over-year incremental margins for Forged Wheels were approximately 45% for the quarter. Improved margins were driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. 
Now let's move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. I would highlight 3 actions. First, in the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $835 million of debt by completing the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $47 million. 
Second, in the third quarter we tendered $600 million of our 6.875% notes due in 2025 and issued $700 million of 3% notes due in 2029. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $20 million. 
Third, with cash on hand, we repurchased $100 million of our 2021 notes through an open market repurchase in Q3 and in October, which neutralized the gross debt impact of the tender and refinancing. The annualized interest expense saving with this action is approximately $5 million. 
As a result of these actions, we have lowered annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million and smoothed out our future debt maturities. At the end of Q3, gross debt was approximately $4.2 billion, which is similar to Q2. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 3.5x in Q2 to 3.2x despite the deployment of cash for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. 
Before turning it back to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items for the quarter. Special items for the third quarter were a net charge of approximately $93 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the bond tender and refinancing completed in the quarter. 
Now let me turn it back over to John."

The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. But also we note the sort of revised requirements or these restrictions being lifted for, certainly, transatlantic travel starting this month. As expected, Howmet transitioned to revenue growth in the third quarter, and we expect year-over-year revenue growth will continue into the fourth quarter and to 2022, with a growth of approximately 12% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 6%. Growth is expected to continue in 2022.  
As expected, the Engine Products business began to grow notably in the third quarter. We expect modest sequential growth in Q4 for Engineered Structures despite continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022. 
In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: In terms of guidance for Q4, I'll just call out the midpoints, as you can read the slide: Revenue, $1.315 billion; EBITDA, $300 million; EBITDA margin, 22.8%; earnings per share of $0.29. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5 billion, plus or minus; EBITDA at $1.135 billion; EBITDA margin at 22.7%; earnings per share increased to $1 per share; and cash flow of $450 million.  
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 8% versus the first half driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and IGTT; Q4 sequential segment incremental operating margins, we expect to be in the order of 28%. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020, the cost-reduction carryover of $100 million, as already commented, is exceeded. Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million and CapEx should be in the range of $180 million to $200 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. 
Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income continues to be approximately 100%. I'd now like to preview some initial thoughts regarding 2022. An early approximate total revenue guide would be for an increase in annual revenues of 12% to 15%, led by recovery in Commercial Aerospace. In aggregate, our current view is that we see an acceleration during the course of the year, following a fairly flat first quarter compared to the fourth quarter this year, except for increased revenues due to metal recovery. We'll refine this view and provide guidance at our earnings call in February 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 14 for the summary. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, which was in line with guidance. Growth was very healthy, year-on-year and sequentially.  Incrementals were truly exceptional, and the company's margin is in the top decile in aerospace. Q3 started -- or marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery. Moreover, we delivered sequential improvements in both EBITDA and earnings per share. We'll continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. Liquidity is strong, and we have very healthy cash generation. 
The fourth quarter, for our -- revenue outlook is $30 million higher than the third quarter, with margins of approximately 23%, which sets a platform for a healthy 2022. Adjusted earnings per share guidance was increased, reflecting lower interest costs.

So first of all, our original expectation, if you went back 6 months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month. Clearly, with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. As far as we can see, Boeing wer",378,"Okay. So first of all, our original expectation, if you went back 6 months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month. Clearly, with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. 
As far as we can see, Boeing were in a 0 build condition for 90 days. And while they've adjusted the rate for the fourth quarter too, my thought has been it's been a 0 build and then it'll be built at maybe 4 a month to average that, too. I don't really know. There's some speculation that maybe have built 2, but it's pretty opaque to us. 
The most important factor is when does recertification occur because whether they build or don't build, it's going to come out of inventory. And we've seen inventories drop as well. And so suppliers into the 787 have been low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the fourth quarter. 
And then the question is what will the rate be in 2022. Our thought at this point is that maybe a 2022 annual build might be 48 aircrafts, don't know. We've had to make some guesstimates, and that's provided for in that 12% to 15% volume increase that I talked about in revenues as an initial thought for 2022. And that takes account of what we think the balance of probability is across all of the end markets that we serve. 
And maybe I'll just continue a bit first to give a better color is when you consider the overall uncertainty in the industry regarding liquidation of inventories and in particular, the -- in wide-body, and the fact that it'll probably be flat for a further 12 months, the supply chain issues, which are certainly very newsworthy but are real. And indeed caused the truck production to be lower in the third quarter, that's also combined with the annual shutdowns in Europe. 
And then, of course, this, I'm going to call, 0-build condition or is it only 2 on the 787. Then I think the sequential growth is outstanding. And all we're doing is not debating the fact of recovery, but what's the exact angle of the slope of recovery, and that's about it really, Rob."

And then depending on 787, I could see some inventory correction in the first quarter. I don't know enough yet to really know. 
In terms of defense, of course, we all know that there's a little bit of seasonality to that, where we do get a second half lift generally, which is a little bit of payback in the first quarter or the use-it-or-lose-it basis for defense budgets for spares in particular. 
Defense, for next year, I'm guessing at this point that -- I'm not going to get too far into '22. But I'll say, fairly flat, if anything, given what Raytheon said about the rate reduction in engine that they see on the, let's say, the original equipment build side. Then that will be fairly muted for us. And then maybe there'll be some pickup on the spare side. So it's difficult to really know there. 
And then the question is, to what degree we'll see level loading from the -- from Lockheed on the overall business. So best guess is, at the moment, I'd say we shouldn't be anticipating too much by way of defense growth next year. but we should be expecting good growth in terms of the narrow-body commercial aircraft production and continuing growth in IGT. Also we do anticipate some of these supply chain constraints will be affecting the commercial truck business to move away certainly by the second half of the year. It's all contained in that 12 to 15 best guess. And I do want to call it a best guess rather than a guide at this point."

So for example, you don't hear me talking about bad weather in Texas. You don't hear me talking about a particular press going down, I don't talk too much about labor and this sort of stuff. It's just work for us, just normal course of business. 
And indeed, for the -- for margins, if you look at nickel, cobalt, all of these metals into our aerospace segments,  they've also had very significant increases. It has aluminum into some of the bulk end in our structures business, and some elements of titanium, although titanium has been pretty muted in aggregate. 
So I just look at all of those things and say, I tend not to call out much. It's just that I think it was on the last call where it was Seth from JPM that was asking specifically about Wheels and the margin, and it's very noticeable for that segment. And so I had to comment about it. And basically, this quarter is exactly the same. So there's a metal impact. 
So last quarter, it was, like, at the company level, because I don't really get into it at the segment level, it was 30 basis points. And this quarter, it's about 20 basis points of impact. And I just called it out for the -- for that Wheels segment. And obviously, if I wanted to, I'd be saying to you things like, well, 22.8 really is 23. And if I added a bit more on for aerospace, it's higher than that. But it's like I don't think it's worthy. And so just don't comment, just move on. 
Our job is to manage these things. And one day when metal begins to abate and goes the other way, maybe I won't be calling it out when things are really good either. So that's about it. But if you want to, use 20 or 30 basis points for aluminum impact on the total holdco for Howmet year-to-date."

I want to be a little bit more cautious today. And essentially, I'm going to hang it all on 787 because, as I said earlier, I don't know exactly what to build, but then neither does anybody seem to know the exact build. And so my assumption is that it's less likely that it will be back at rate 5 in January. And so based upon that, I'm going to say it's more like a Q2 effect. 
But again, you tell me 787, I'll tell you what fasteners do because it's significant in the life of that business. And my assumption is the rest is pretty flat, wide-body, by improving on narrowbody. So it's really difficult to be precise on any of this at this point in time. That's why all I know is that recovery is occurring, revenues are going up. And the only thing we were really debating here is just what exactly is the angle, that requires us to make a judgment around labor inputs. The rest just falls into place when we know the angle. It'll be upswing.

I'm not subscribing to anything that magically changes on the first of January. It's just another day in our lives. But I do think that things begin to ease as we go through the back end of the year. 
And whether it's -- the chip shortages begin to ease or whether it's resins or whether it's glass, all of these things. Piece -- been working on that for 6, 9 months. And so bit by bit, they do get resolved capacities, broad supply chains ironed out, people come back to work and vaccination rates go up, and so labor availability, let's say, in Malaysia gets better, and so on. 
So the end market demand for commercial trucks is. like, really high. And so this quarter, what we saw was that some of our major customers have actually -- I'm going to say, given up trying to build on 3 shifts and have intermittent build on and off every few days. It's so, I call it our customers need to completely abandon its third shift. 
I just accepted that for the next for -- let's say, the balance of year, they're going to just operate on 2 shifts, reassess again in '22. My expectation is that the -- well, orders, dealerships have been very high. Those will be further improved when 2022 pricing is announced for end markets for those trucks. 
So that's why I'm giving you my best estimate of what I think is going to happen. But there's no -- I mean I don't have a special fact set that's private to me, just like just like looking at all of the factors which have been constraining supply and saying, what do I think and what's a balanced view? And I'm going to go with, it begins to materially improve in the second half of next year because the demand is there. And what we don't build, we'll just get added to the backlog where the backlog is already enormous. It will get added to '23 backlog."

So my guess is that CapEx, when we guide it, will be a bit higher than this year, but still a source of cash compared to depreciation. I think cash taxes will be higher. That's just a function of profit. 
So that's a piece of the equation. Working capital, it depends on the slope of the recovery, but I guess it will be a slight drag. I think pension, in aggregate, will be lower cash cost than '21. That's as much as I've got, I can -- we've got a view what each of those numbers is. But at the moment, we're still refining it as we get a better view on the overall demand side. 
Ken, anything you'd like to supplement a bit more granular than that?"

So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension in OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. And yo",352,"No. The only thing that I would add to that is just the work that we've done on the pension in the OPEB side. So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension in OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. 
And you saw in the materials here, what we've been doing on pension and OPEB this year and that always benefits next year. But just a couple of items, if I start first with the balance sheet side of the equation, the liability has gone down around $180 million for pension and OPEB. That's significant. That's a combination of company actions that we've taken, as well as the asset returns that we had last year that flow into 2021 and then our contributions. 
But the little known fact as well is we have been spending a lot of time to reduce our gross liability for the pension. Last year, you saw us move around $320 million, either annuitizing or buying out certain programs. We intend to continue that this year, probably another $230 million of gross liability reduction in our gross liability. So that'll help us out. 
And then we're also assuming everything right now, all these numbers at discount rates stay where they're at. If we looked at where discount rates finished last year, it was about 2.5%. And if you snap the line today, it'd be about 2.8%, so a 30 basis point improvement, that's going to help. We've shared our sensitivity in the past, about a 25 basis point improvement, improves our position by about $90 million. So hopefully, that stays where it's at. 
But definitely doing a lot of work on the balance sheet side. You see how that flows into the P&L. Our pension and OPEB expenses this year, year-to-date, are about $12 million. It's a 50% reduction to where we were from last year. But not only P&L, but as we talked about, that'll all help us out from the cash contribution side next year. So we anticipate, as we mentioned, to be lower than $120 million."

I mean, well over $0.5 billion of gross liabilities come off the balance sheet, which inherently reduces its volatility to both mortality and the interest rates going forward. 
So I treat that as a really outstanding outcome with essentially very little cash used to achieve that. And it's hard to draw a line between that exactly in value, but it does matter in terms of what that gross and then also the net liabilities are for the company."
